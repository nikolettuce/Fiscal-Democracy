Pittsburg for a special drug enforcement team be adopted?”	NO	

ANALYSIS OF MEASURE

PITTSBURG POLICE PROTECTION SERVICES TAX
(Elections Code section 5011)

This measure amends the Pittsburg Municipal Code to add a chapter authorizing the
City Council to levy a special tax on property owners in the City to fund a special drug
enforcement team in the Pittsburg Police Department. This special tax requires approval by
two-thirds of the voters voting on the measure. The tax is adopted under the authority of
California Government Code section 53978 and other applicable law.

The tax would be imposed beginning with fiscal year 1991-1992, and ending with fiscal
year 1994-1995. Maximum amounts for the tax are set forth in the ordinance. The tax could
not be extended, nor could the maximum tax amounts be increased, without two-thirds voter
approval.

The tax is levied on each parcel depending upon the number of units on the parcel. Each
unit would be taxed at a rate not to exceed $29.52 per year. For example, a single family
residence would be taxed not more than $29.52 per year. A duplex would be taxed not more
than $59.04 per year. The owner of an apartment building with 20 units would be taxed not
more than $590.40 per year. The tax would be collected along with property taxes.

Commercial and industrial parcels are taxed based upon the number of separate busines-
ses on the parcel. A parcel which contained one business would be taxed not more than $29.52
per year. A parcel containing a shopping center with 30 separate businesses would be taxed
not more than $885.60 per year.

Proceeds of the tax would be placed in a special fund, and could only be used to pay for
such items as salary, benefits and equipment for a special drug enforcement team of police
officers. The team would focus primarily on the enforcement of criminal statutes concerning
the possession,use and sale of illegal drugs and controlled substances, and perform such other
police activities as directed by the Chief of Police. The ordinance requires an annual audit of
the special fund to ensure that proceeds of the tax are used as provided in the ordinance.

The ordinance requires the City Council to establish a process to evaluate the operation
of the ordinance which provides for participation by interested members of the community.

This tax would not change any other taxes or fees for City services. Its effect on existing
law is to amend the Municipal Code to authorize the levy of the tax.

of the ordinance, please call the City Clerk’s office at 439-4850 and a copy will be mailed at
no cost to you.”

of property basis. The tax is not measured or determined by the
value of the property.

The police protection services tax shall be due in two equal
installments in accordance with the collection procedures of the
Contra Costa County Tax Collector. For example, the first
installment for fiscal year 1991-1992 is due November 1, 1991, and

in the same manner, and on the same dates as for other charges and
taxes collected by Contra Costa County on behalf of the City of
Pittsburg.

Section 3.34.060 Collection

A.	The police protection services tax shall be collected in
the same manner, on the same dates, and subject to the same

of the City of Pittsburg. The County may deduct reasonable costs
it incurs in collecting this tax from monies collected before
remitting the balance to the City.

penalties and interest thereon, shall constitute a lien against the
parcel upon which it is levied until it has been paid and shall
constitute a personal obligation to the City of Pittsburg by the
persons who own the	parcel on the	date the tax is due.

Section 3.34.070	Determination	of Parcels. Zoning and	Use

each exemption required or authorized by applicable federal or
state law. This tax is not imposed upon a federal or state
governmental agency or another local agency. The homeowners and

SECTION 2.	Findings

The City Council has reviewed and considered the information
contained in the City's file on this matter, including without
limitation the staff report presented to the Council on August 6,
1990 (the "Report"). The Council finds that the information
contained in the Report is true and correct, and has assisted the
Council in making its decision on this matter, along with other
relevant information.

SECTION 2.	Effective	Date;	Urgency Measure

The City Council's adoption of this ordinance and referral of
it to the voters shall be effective immediately as an ordinance
relating to an election (Government Code §36937(a)), and as an
urgency measure (Government Code §36937(b)).	The facts

constituting the urgency are: August 10, 1990 is the deadline for
submitting a ballot proposition to the Board of Supervisors and
County Clerk of Contra Costa County for inclusion on the ballot in
the November, 1990 general election. Unless the City Council's
referral of this measure to the voters is effective immediately,
consideration by	the voters	would	not occur	until	1991,	thus

delaying funding	of the drug	enforcement team	described	in	this

ordinance for an additional year.

This ordinance shall be referred to a vote of the electorate
of the City at an election to be held on November 6, 1990. If two-
thirds of the voters voting on the measure approve it, the City
Council shall adopt a resolution declaring that the measure passed,
and the chapter included in this ordinance becomes effective 10
days after adoption of that resolution.

The foregoing ordinance was adopted by the City Council of the
City of Pittsburg at a meeting held on August 6,	1990,	by	the

SUBJECT:	POLICE	PROTECTION MEASURE

CRIME ABATEMENT TEAM (C.A.T.)

Subsequent to our discussions and presentations to the City
Council, the department has clearly identified the need to
establish a permanent team of officers who direct their attention
to specific criminal problems in geographical areas that impact
the City as a whole.

In the latter part of 1988, and throughout the calendar year of
1989, we implemented the Crime Abatement Team (C.A.T.), consisting
of experienced officers addressing these concerns on an overtime
basis. The C.A.T. Team provided a more focused impact on narcotic
sales activity, and the associated problems of visible street
crime (i.e., disturbances, public intoxication, loitering in both
commercial and residential areas, and prostitution).

The successes experienced by the team on an overtime basis was
well supported by the community. However, in comparison to hours
expended the program lacked cost effectiveness. Nor did it meet
the expectations, or have the impact we envisioned possible with a
team comprised of officers on a regular full time basis.

In January 1990 we implemented a permanent two (2) man team
replacing the five (5) man team on overtime. Our evaluation of
the permanent team was extremely positive in terms of arrests, in
that the two (2) men initiated 102 felony narcotics arrests in the
first forty four (44) working days. We did however identify that
the two (2) man team provided for insufficient manpower to
adequately impact larger crowds of loiterers that frequent
locations where narcotics are sold and used, and impact the
associated crimes that are most commonly the narcotic addict's
source of income.

Budget restrictions prevented us from continuing the effectiveness
of the C.A.T. Team on an overtime basis. Although we have
continued the two (2) man permanent team with tremendous success,
it is not comparable to the five (5) man unit in terms of overall

impact in providing a more permanent resolution to the problem.
The C.A.T. Team is an integral part of establishing a solution to
these concerns, and must be able to provide consistent specialized
enforcement over a duration of time with adequate staffing. This
would allow the impacted areas to establish neighborhood watch and
crime prevention programs with a lasting effect.

The successes of the C.A.T. Team have been hailed by the most
affected neighborhoods and community actions organizations as well
as the community as a whole, due to the marked reduction in
visible street and associated criminal activities; particularly
burglary.

The C.A.T. Team approach has been effective in helping the
department reduce or maintain at status quo levels, the number of
criminal incidents investigated citywide even with the
considerable community growth in both commercial, retail and
residential property. Specialized high visibility enforcement
teams have been identified by law enforcement and community
organizations as both an effective and cost productive means of
combating such problems.

TEAM COMPOSITION

We are proposing a team consisting of one (1) sergeant and four

(4)	officers; one (1) half time hourly clerk, and one (1)
additional vehicle to supplement our existing marked vehicle
fleet. Through our trial period, we found that an independent
uniformed working supervisor is necessary for the successful
implementation of the program. The project is very goal oriented,
but must	be	flexible enough	to adjust and respond	to	varying

circumstances	and specific	policing concerns.	The	program

requires	a '	high level of	supervision and decision	making

responsibility.

This concept is a proposal to fund the position of one (1)
sergeant and four (4) officers, as opposed to establishing a
permanent assignment of a sergeant and four full time officers
annually;	this appropriates	one (1) sergeant for	2080 hours

annually, and four officers each at 2080 hours annually for C.A.T.
Team enforcement.

Flexibility is a key element in the success of this program, both
in policing responsibilities and of the personnel assigned. It is
necessary that the department have flexibility to assign officers
in or out of the unit on a regular basis, such as the temporary
assignment of a police K-9; a new officer for covert buy programs

or decoys; a more experienced officer for community organization
or tactical situations, etc. Additionally, we are proposing one

(1)	half time clerk on a non-permanent basis (hourly) to comprise
individual team statistics for accurate accountability, prepare
reports and investigative data, time sheets, correspondence,
record citizen input, and requests as applicable. We are also
requesting one (1) additional marked vehicle to supplement the
existing fleet vehicles which will be utilized by the team.

TEAM GOALS/RESPONSIBILITIES

The team goals will be to focus high visibility and enforcement
actions specifically in targeted areas focusing foremost on;

1.	The suppression of narcotics possession, sales, and use.

2.	Public consumption of intoxicants to include both drugs and
alcohol.

3.	Visible street crime to include public intoxication, loiter-
ing, prostitution, assaults, disturbances, robbery, burglary,
and theft.

4.	Identify public nuisances in the targeted areas which
attribute to, encourage, or condone illegal narcotic activity
and criminal activity directly related to it; create neigh-
borhood deterioration or disturbances; or place immediate
residents in jeopardy.

The team must have the flexibility and mobility to focus and
diversify throughout the entire community in any identified area
within this criterion. This would include, only on an as needed
basis, addressing the problems of a major burglary outbreak or
influx created by the congregation of narcotic users or narcotic
gangs; drug or alcohol disturbances occurring on a consistent
basis within public or residential parks; identified and organized
criminal commercial theft rings operating as a result of drug use
or sales; and addressing those specialized policing problems that
are directly related to the sales or use of drugs, and are
identified by the department as needing attention beyond the
capabilities of general patrol in terms of time and enforcement
action.

The team will not be utilized for general duty law enforcement;
responding to general requests for police services, traffic
enforcement, etc. However, would be available for actual
community disasters such as floods, earthquakes, environmental

Pursuant to community dialogue and discussion with the city
administration and city council we are proposing funding from a
special community tax imposed specifically for this identified
police service alone, that would not impact general funding for
existing or proposed regular police services.

This project and the funding would have an established expiration
date and an annual community review for the purpose of cost
accounting and to ensure the goals and objectives are met with
successful results.

Based on the cost accounting from the Finance Department at todays
salary and benefits rate we are proposing a project with a fiscal
impact of $360,964.00 for the fist year with a maximum of 5%
inflation over the remaining years;

100% annual salary - patrolman = $45,885 benefits 18,354 =

$64,239 X	4	=	$256,956

100% annual salary - sergeant = $53,484 benefits 21,394 =

$74,878	=	74,878

50 % hourly clerk (class 100)	=	$10,500 benefits (n/a)	=

$10,500	=	10,500

One vehicle
$18,000

(purchase-depreciation-maintentance)

= 18,000

Totaling

$360,964

Subsequent to our discussions with city council, city
administration, the city attorney and finance director we would
propose a resolution that establishes fiscal responsibility on the
basis of residential dwelling or individual business unit basis as
opposed to a per parcel basis. This more equitably divides the
responsibility between an individual single family dwelling or
business as compared to multiple units on an individual parcel
which requires or necessitates a higher level of service.

This proposal not only impacts individual identified
neighborhoods, but improves the community image and most
importantly public health and safety from the direct result of
substance abuse. It includes all phases of the community from low

income subsidized properties through newly established
neighborhoods and community parks. It addresses the needs of
businesses who are negatively impacted by robberies, burglaries
and thefts from drug addicts, and better assures the safety of
their consumers which increases business and their image.

In conclusion the C.A.T. Team concept has proven very successful
throughout the trial period during the last eighteen (18) months.
It has become an anticipated or expected level of service from the
community. We have reviewed all other avenues of funding or
manpower assignments, based upon the existing and anticipated
department resources without success other than mandated overtime
which is not cost effective.

We believe from our experience, and that of other law enforcement
agencies that the specialized and selective task force approach
will have the most impact and most permanent effect on the drug
related crime problems facing communities and law enforcement in
the 1990's.

MANPOWER COSTS

DATE:	March	22,	1990

FROM:	Len	Castiglione

Chief of Police

During the 1988 calendar year we identified the need to provide a
more focused impact on narcotic sales activities and the
associated problems of visible street crime including disturb-
ances , public intoxication, and loitering in designated areas.

We designed and implemented a program entitled the Crime Abatement
Team (CAT), consisting of one (1) Sergeant and a minimum of four
(4) officers which supplemented our regular patrol enforcement
efforts.

The CAT Team was assigned on an overtime basis necessitated by our
existing manpower restaints.

CAT Team members were selected for their experience, knowledge,
and ability to identify known narcotic dealers. Their efforts
were frequently supplement by additional officers by overtime
entitled as Selective Enforcement.

For the calendar year of 1989 we directed specifica11y, excluding
associated court appearances, a total of 2,647 hours for a
combination of CAT Team/Selective Enforcement activity on an
overtime basis. This is an expenditure or $71,969 in unexpected
overtime costs with the majority of time and costs expended
between the months of April and October.

The program development has been very effective in addressing the
problem, however cost prohibitive. In February 1990 we found It
necessary to suspend this Selective Enforcement activity due to
expense in appropriated overtime funds in an effort to balance our
overall budget.

Based upon necessity and the project success, just prior to the
suspension of ongoing overtime Selective Enforcement, we assigned
two men from uniformed patrol to a permanent "CAT Team" assignment
beginning January 21,	1990. To date these two (2) officers, in

this specialized assignment, have initiated 102 felony narcotics
arrests in forty four (44) working days.

The success of the "CAT" Program is impacted by the assignment of
well trained and highly motivated officers as well as goal
oriented management.

A realistic option to address the ongoing narcotics problem is to
enhance the concept of a permanent team with the assignment of a
Sergeant and a minimum of four (4) officers.

Based upon existing salaries and benefits, the cost of this
concept would be $348,036.00 per year, including an estimated 10X
for court appearance overtime which could be kept to a minimum by
adjusting the team members regular hours for court appearances.

Sgt. - E-Step - wages (50,998) benefits 40X (20,399) = $71,397
Ptrlmn. - E-Step - wages (43,750) benefits 40X (17,500) = $61,250

x 4

11245,0001
= $316,397.00

Court Appearance Overtime; est. .10X.................... $	31,639.00

TOTAL = $348,036.00

The employment of five (5) new officers to divert five (5)
existing uniformed officers from Patrol to CAT would also
necessitate an expenditure of approximately $25,000.00 for safety
equipment/specialized training during the first year only.

This concept is not proposed within our current budget requests,
although we have asked for needed additional officers for Patrol
and General Investigations. Should it be implemented, it would
necessitate an additional budget request for personnel.

Please advise me should you need additional information or statis-
tics.

resolution adopt such other rules and regulations necessary to
carry out this chapter."

SECTION 2.	Findings

The City Council has reviewed and considered the information
contained in the City's file on this matter, including without
limitation the staff report presented to the Council on August 6,
1990 (the "Report"). The Council finds that the information
contained in the Report is true and correct, and has assisted the
Council in making its decision on this matter, along with other
relevant information.

SECTION 2.	Effective	Date;	Urgency Measure

The City Council's adoption of this ordinance and referral of
it to the voters shall be effective immediately as an ordinance
relating to an election (Government Code §36937(a)), and as an
urgency measure (Government Code §36937(b)).	The facts

constituting the urgency are: August 10, 1990 is the deadline for
submitting a ballot proposition to the Board of Supervisors and
County Clerk of Contra Costa County for inclusion on the ballot in
the November, 1990 general election. Unless the City Council's
referral of this measure to the voters is effective immediately,
consideration by	the voters	would	not occur	until	1991,	thus

delaying funding	of the drug	enforcement team	described	in	this

ordinance for an additional year.

This ordinance shall be referred to a vote of the electorate
of the City at an election to be held on November 6, 1990. If two-
thirds of the voters voting on the measure approve it, the City
Council shall adopt a resolution declaring that the measure passed,
and the chapter included in this ordinance becomes effective 10
days after adoption of that resolution.

The foregoing ordinance was adopted by the City Council of the
City of Pittsburg at a meeting held on August 6,	1990,	by	the

following four-fifths vote:

CRIME ABATEMENT TEAM (C.A.T.)

Subsequent to our discussions and presentations to the City
Council, the department has clearly identified the need to
establish a permanent team of officers who direct their attention
to specific criminal problems in geographical areas that impact
the City as a whole.

In the latter part of 1988, and throughout the calendar year of
1989, we implemented the Crime Abatement Team (C.A.T.), consisting
of experienced officers addressing these concerns on an overtime
basis. The C.A.T. Team provided a more focused impact on narcotic
sales activity, and the associated problems of visible street
crime (i.e., disturbances, public intoxication, loitering in both
commercial and residential areas, and prostitution).

The successes experienced by the team on an overtime basis was
well supported by the community. However, in comparison to hours
expended the program lacked cost effectiveness. Nor did it meet
the expectations, or have the impact we envisioned possible with a
team comprised of officers on a regular full time basis.

In January 1990 we implemented a permanent two (2) man team
replacing the five (5) man team on overtime. Our evaluation of
the permanent team was extremely positive in terms of arrests, in
that the two (2) men initiated 102 felony narcotics arrests in the
first forty four (44) working days. We did however identify that
the two (2) man team provided for insufficient manpower to
adequately impact larger crowds of loiterers that frequent
locations where narcotics are sold and used, and impact the
associated crimes that are most commonly the narcotic addict's
source of income.

Budget restrictions prevented us from continuing the effectiveness
of the C.A.T. Team on an overtime basis. Although we have
continued the two (2) man permanent team with tremendous success,
it is not comparable to the five (5) man unit in terms of overall

impact in providing a more permanent resolution to the problem.
The C.A.T. Team is an integral part of establishing a solution to
these concerns, and must be able to provide consistent specialized
enforcement over a duration of time with adequate staffing. This
would allow the impacted areas to establish neighborhood watch and
crime prevention programs with a lasting effect.

The successes of the C.A.T. Team have been hailed by the most
affected neighborhoods and community actions organizations as well
as the community as a whole, due to the marked reduction in
visible street and associated criminal activities; particularly
burglary.

The C.A.T. Team approach has been effective in helping the
department reduce or maintain at status quo levels, the number of
criminal incidents investigated citywide even with the
considerable community growth in both commercial, retail and
residential property. Specialized high visibility enforcement
teams have been identified by law enforcement and community
organizations as both an effective and cost productive means of
combating such problems.

TEAM COMPOSITION

We are proposing a team consisting of one (1) sergeant and four

(4)	officers; one (1) half time hourly clerk, and one (1)
additional vehicle to supplement our existing marked vehicle
fleet. Through our trial period, we found that an independent
uniformed working supervisor is necessary for the successful
implementation of the program. The project is very goal oriented,
but must	be	flexible enough	to adjust and respond	to	varying

circumstances	and specific	policing concerns.	The	program

requires	a	high level of	supervision and decision	making

responsibility.

This concept is a proposal to fund the position of one (1)
sergeant and four (4) officers, as opposed to establishing a
permanent assignment of a sergeant and four full time officers
annually;	this appropriates	one (1) sergeant for	2080 hours

annually, and four officers each at 2080 hours annually for C.A.T.
Team enforcement.

Flexibility is a key element in the success of this program, both
in policing responsibilities and of the personnel assigned. It is
necessary that the department have flexibility to assign officers
in or out of the unit on a regular basis, such as the temporary
assignment of a police K-9; a new officer for covert buy programs

or decoys? a more experienced officer for community organization
or tactical situations, etc. Additionally, we are proposing one
(1) half time clerk on a non-permanent basis (hourly) to comprise
individual team statistics for accurate accountability, prepare
reports and investigative data, time sheets, correspondence,
record citizen input, and requests as applicable. We are also
requesting one (1) additional marked vehicle to supplement the
existing fleet vehicles which will be utilized by the team.

TEAM GOALS/RESPONSIBILITIES

The team goals will be to focus high visibility and enforcement
actions specifically in targeted areas focusing foremost on?

1.	The suppression of narcotics possession, sales, and use.

2.	Public consumption of intoxicants to include both drugs and
alcohol.

3.	Visible street crime to include public intoxication, loiter-
ing, prostitution, assaults, disturbances, robbery, burglary,
and theft.

4.	Identify public nuisances in the targeted areas which
attribute to, encourage, or condone illegal narcotic activity
and criminal activity directly related to it? create neigh-
borhood deterioration or disturbances? or place immediate
residents in jeopardy.

The team must have the flexibility and mobility to focus and
diversify throughout the entire community in any identified area
within this criterion. This would include, only on an as needed
basis, addressing the problems of a major burglary outbreak or
influx created by the congregation of narcotic users or narcotic
gangs? drug or alcohol disturbances occurring on a consistent
basis within public or residential parks? identified and organized
criminal commercial theft rings operating as a result of drug use
or sales? and addressing those specialized policing problems that
are directly related to the sales or use of drugs, and are
identified by the department as needing attention beyond the
capabilities of general patrol in terms of time and enforcement
action.

The team will not be utilized for general duty law enforcement?
responding to general requests for police services, traffic
enforcement, etc. However, would be available for actual
community disasters such as floods, earthquakes, environmental

TEAM COST/FISCAL IMPACT/FUNDING

Pursuant to community dialogue and discussion with the city
administration and city council we are proposing funding from a
special community tax imposed specifically for this identified
police service alone, that would not impact general funding for
existing or proposed regular police services.

This project and the funding would have an established expiration
date and an annual community review for the purpose of cost
accounting and to ensure the goals and objectives are met with
successful results.

Based on the cost accounting from the Finance Department at todays
salary and benefits rate we are proposing a project with a fiscal
impact of $360,964.00 for the fist year with a maximum of 5%
inflation over the remaining years;

100% annual salary - patrolman = $45,885 benefits 18,354 =

$64,239 X 4 —	$256,956

100% annual salary - sergeant = $53,484 benefits 21,394 =

$74,878	=	74,878

50 % hourly clerk (class 100)	=	$10,500 benefits (n/a)	=

$10,500	=	10,500

One vehicle (purchase-depreciation-maintentance)	=

$18,000	=	18,000

Totaling	$360,964

Subsequent to our discussions with city council, city
administration, the city attorney and finance director we would
propose a resolution that establishes fiscal responsibility on the
basis of residential dwelling or individual business unit basis as
opposed to a per parcel basis. This more equitably divides the
responsibility between an individual single family dwelling or
business as compared to multiple units on an individual parcel
which requires or necessitates a higher level of service.

This proposal not only impacts individual identified
neighborhoods, but improves the community image and most
importantly public health and safety from the direct result of
substance abuse. It includes all phases of the community from low

income subsidized properties through newly established

neighborhoods and community parks. It addresses the needs of
businesses who are negatively impacted by robberies, burglaries
and thefts from drug addicts, and better assures the safety of
their consumers which increases business and their image.

In conclusion the C.A.T. Team concept has proven very successful
throughout the trial period during the last eighteen (18) months.
It has become an anticipated or expected level of service from the
community. We have reviewed all other avenues of funding or
manpower assignments, based upon the existing and anticipated
department resources without success other than mandated overtime
which is not cost effective.

We believe from our experience, and that of other law enforcement
agencies that the specialized and selective task force approach
will have the most impact and most permanent effect on the drug
related crime problems facing communities and law enforcement in
the 1990's.

During the 1988 calendar year we identified the need to provide a
more focused impact on narcotic sales activities and the
associated problems of visible street crime including disturb-
ances , public intoxication, and loitering in designated areas.

We designed and implemented a program entitled the Crime Abatement
Team (CAT), consisting of one (1) Sergeant and a minimum of four
(4) officers which supplemented our regular patrol enforcement
efforts.

The CAT Team was assigned on an overtime basis necessitated by our
existing manpower restaints.

CAT Team members were selected for their experience, knowledge,
and ability to identify known narcotic dealers. Their efforts
were frequently supplement by additional officers by overtime
entitled as Selective Enforcement.

For the calendar year of 1989 we directed specifically, excluding
associated court appearances, a total of 2,647 hours for a
combination of CAT Team/Selective Enforcement activity on an
overtime basis. This is an expenditure or $71,969 in unexpected
overtime costs with the majority of time and costs expended
between the months of April and October.

The program development has been very effective in addressing the
problem, however cost prohibitive.	In February 1990 we found it

necessary to suspend this Selective Enforcement activity due to
expense in appropriated overtime funds in an effort to balance our
overall budget.

Based upon necessity and the project success, just prior to the
suspension of ongoing overtime Selective Enforcement, we assigned
two men from uniformed patrol to a permanent "CAT Team" assignment
beginning January 21,	1990. To date these two (2) officers, in

this specialized assignment, have initiated 102 felony narcotics
arrests in forty four (44) working days.

The success of the "CAT" Program is impacted by the assignment of
well trained and highly motivated officers as well as goal
oriented management.

A realistic option to address the ongoing narcotics problem is to
enhance the concept of a permanent team with the assignment of a
Sergeant and a minimum of four (4) officers.

Based upon existing salaries and benefits, the cost of this
concept would be $348,036.00 per year, including an estimated 10%
for court appearance overtime which could be kept to a minimum by
adjusting the team members regular hours for court appearances.

Sgt. - E-Step - wages (50,998) benefits 40% (20,399) = $71,397
Ptrlmn. - E-Step - wages (43,750) benefits 40% (17,500) = $61,250

x 4

($245,000)
= $316,397.00

Court Appearance Overtime; est. .10%.................... $	31,639.00

TOTAL = $348,036.00

The employment of five (5) new officers to divert five (5)
existing uniformed officers from Patrol to CAT would also
necessitate an expenditure of approximately $25,000.00 for safety
equipment/specia1ized training during the first year only.

This concept is not proposed within our current budget requests,
although we have asked for needed additional officers for Patrol
and General Investigations. Should it be implemented, it would
necessitate an additional budget request for personnel.

Please advise me should you need additional information or statis-
tics.
