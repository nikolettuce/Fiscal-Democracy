to the transient occupancy tax contained in Chapter 3.30 of
the Plymouth Municipal Code from six percent (6%) to ten
percent (10%) of the rent charged by hotel operators within
the City to raise additional funds for general municipal purposes.

. A transient occupancy tax is a type of general tax collected
by hotel operators and remitted to the City tax collector that
may be increased to achieve these purposes.

. California Constitution Article XIIIC, Section 2(b) requires that
an election on a general tax, including transient occupancy
tax, be consolidated with a statewide general election at which
members of the City Council will be elected.

. Pursuant to Government Code Sections 53723 and 53724 an
ordinance proposing to increase a general tax, including a
transient occupancy tax, must be approved by two-thirds vote
of all members of the City Council, and thereafter be approved
by a majority vote of qualified voters of the City voting in an
election in order for the increase to the transient occupancy
tax to become effective.

election at which members of the City Council will be elected.

1.	Pursuant to CEQA Guidelines 15060(c)(2) and (c)(3) and 15378,

CITY OF PLYMOUTH
CITY ATTORNEY IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
MEASURE R

The City of Plymouth currently taxes the privilege of occupying a room
in a hotel or a similar place of lodging within the City. A hotel guest
pays the tax, and the hotel operator collects the tax and forwards it
to the City. The tax is called a “transient occupancy tax” (“TOT”) and
is frequently referred to as a “hotel tax.” The City of Plymouth’s current
TOT rate is six percent (6%) of the amount that the hotel operators
charges for the privilege of occupancy. The tax rate of six percent
(6%) has remained unchanged since the City first adopted the TOT
in 1980. Measure R, if approved by the voters, would increase the
TOT from six percent (6%) to ten percent (10%) of the amount charged
by hotel operators for occupancy.

The additional tax revenue generated by the increase in the TOT rate
would be deposited in the City’s general fund and may be used to
fund general public services. As such, the TOT increase is considered
a “general tax,” which must be approved by a majority of the electorate
in order to become effective.

A “yes” vote is a vote to approve the increasing the hotel tax to
ten percent (10%).

A “no” vote is a vote against approving increasing the hotel tax

to ten percent (10%).

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE R

Measure R requires tourists to pay for the services they receive and
the impact they create while visiting our community. It allows Plymouth
to invest in projects that make Plymouth more attractive to everyone
and to increase our business in tourism and recreation.

Over the next ten years, Measure R will make over $500,000 available
for improving city services and make Plymouth a more attractive
community to visit.

Specifically Measure R will:

•	Hefp make needed Improvements. Measure R will make on
average, $50,000 available every year for general municipal
services and community promotion. These include placing signs
on our roads for direction to the Fair Grounds, Shenandoah Valley,
downtown Plymouth, and to welcome visitors; for street paving,
erecting street lights, providing off-street parking, street decorations,
and improvements to our parks.

•	Be paid for bv tourists. Measure R requires hotel and motel
guests to pay an additional 4% on their room rates. City of Plymouth
residents living in their homes will not have their taxes affected in
any way by this measure. In addition, guests with recreation vehicles
at the 49er Trailer Village will pay an additional 4% per night.

•	Protect local jobs. By promoting tourism, recreation activities
and entertainment Plymouth will generate new jobs for local
residents. Measure R will help put people to work and protect
existing jobs.

On November 6th, please support Measure R.
