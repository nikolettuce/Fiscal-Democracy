ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF
WALNUT CREEK SCHOOL DISTRICT
PARCEL TAX MEASURE C

Die Walnut (. reek School District receives less money per pupil than any other school district in
Contra Costa County. It’s lime now to fund our schools at a level that will provide our students with
the education they need to be productive community members capable of meeting the challenges of
the 21* century!

A ‘ves’ vote on Measure (’will:
#

•	Better prepare our students for success in the sciences by providing more hands-on laboratory
experience.

•	Help students meet (and even exceed) new stale requirements to master algebra by the 8,h grade

•	Improve student learning through the integration of tine arts in the curriculum.

•	Provide extra help and challenges to each student through the individualized attention that lower
class sizes in grades 4 - 8 will provide (The State provides primary funding for lower class siz.es
in Kindergarten through 3rd grades.)

We in the Walnut Creek School District are fortunate to have schools that arc responsive to the

educational needs of our children In fact, each school in the district has recently been designated a

California Distinguished School! But the requirements for a superior education are constantly rising.

and we need to provide the means to meet those requirements before our students start to fall behind. .

Please help us meet those requirements by voting Yes on Measure CM

A senior citizen (65 or older) exemption is available

A 'yes’ vote will also protect and enhance property values in our community There is a clear
connection between the quality of life in a community and the success of its schools. Make that
investment now! For $41 dollars a year per parcel (less than 12 cents a day), you can help build a
better community through improved education for its junior citizens.

We don't believe taxpayers should be assessed extra dollars for what ought to be among our
schools' unquestioned, basic-mission priorities: quality instruction in mathematics and science.

And studies by the principal investigators into the alleged benefits of class-size reduction show

•	As experts observe: STIJPENT-TO-TKAC HER RATIOS IMPROVED NATION ALLYBY
35% FROM I9SOTO 199S — but performance indicators (such as the National Assessment of
Educational Progress and SAT scores) worsened. And such objective measures of educational
achievement have shown little or no improvement since 1995.

•	*7/is clear that states CANNOT IMPROVE STUDENT PERFORMANCE ever time SIM PLY
BY TWEAKING PUP1L-TO-TEACHF.R RATIOS, building more schools, or adjusting the
level of federal assistance they receive** (American legislative Exchange Council. 8/24/00).

•	SO MEASURE C ASSURES ONLY $328 IN NEW TAXES PER PARCEL. Its proceeds
would become general-fund money, later available for salary negotiations, f uture school boards
would not be bound to spend Measure C money for advertised purposes.

•	BUT DISTRICT BUREAUCRATS KNOW THAT CLASS-SIZE REDUCTION IS
POPULAR, REGARDLESS OF POOR RESEARCH SUPPORT. So that s what they
emphasize, instead of (he critical, no-cost reforms that ate really needed.

If WCSD ‘‘receives less money per pupil..." (as tax promoters claim), (hat's u political inequity
that h NOT the fault of already overburdened local taxpayers. So please join us....

ARGUMENT AGAINST
WALNUT CREEK SCHOOL DISTRICT
PARCEL TAX MEASURE C

THE WALNUT ( KEEK SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS PUSHED A PARCEL TAX BEFORE. Il

failed then, as it should fail now WCSD can and should find ways to get the job done, without more
new taxes.

•	THIS LATEST TAX SCHEME ARRIVES JUST AFTER THE DISTRICT HAS
IMPLEMENTED LARGE SALARY INCREASES. Figures published in the Contra Costa
Times (Dec 11. 2000) reveal WCSD 2000-2001 staff raises ranging from 11.3% to 12 4%

•	MEASURE C FUNDS CAN RAISE SALARIES AGAIN, or help divert other funds to that
purpose.

•	PARCEL TAXES AFFECT SMALL-PARC EL OWNERS DISPROPORTIONATELY. A

“fixer-upper" cottage owner, handing over the same $4) as the wealthy proprietor of a large
commercial building, would effectively pay a MUCH HIGHER TAX RATH.

•	ANY NEW FUNDING FOR CLASS-SIZE REDUCTION SHOULD COME FROM THE

4

STATE'S LARGE TAX Sl.RPU.iS — $13 Billion last year, perhaps $10 Billion this year
We’re taxed more than enough already.

•	$3.9 BILLION OF CALIFORNIA’S ANNUAL TAX BONANZA COMES IS LIFTED
FROM COUNTY AGENCIES, allegedly for the “Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund”
U'.RAF) The Lottery... Prop.98... Prop 203.. Prop. 1 A...Prop 39... ERAF. . Enough is enough!

•	CALIFORNIANS’ INFLATION-ADJUSTED STATE AND LOCAL TAXES ALREADY
exceed PWK-l>ROP. 13 I.F.VKI.S. Prop 39, passed in November, will drive school taxes
even higher.

•	THE ACALANES UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT IS SIMULTANEOUSLY
PROMOTING AN $85 PARCEL TAX. Walnut Creek residents will pay both taxes if both
pass.

•	MEASURE C’i BLANKET SENIOR EXEMPTION IS UNFAIR TO OTHER
TAXPAYERS.

NEW TAXES CANNOT BE THE FIRST, LAST, AM) ALWAYS SOLUTION TO EVERY
PERCEIVED PROBLEM IN SCHOOLS. Instead, we must require better performance for the huge

amounts of money consumed by schools already.

UNLIKE MEASURE C PROPONENTS. WE HAVEN’T HIRED A PROFESSIONAL
CAMPAIGN AGENT. We rely instead on your common sense.	#

PARCEL TAX MEASURE C

Don 't let a vocal few prevent us from making our schools the best they can be! Although no one wants
to pay more taxes unnecessarily, this is our only option to lower class size to increase our students’
proficiency in math and science and improve reading and writing skills. For just pennies a day!

•	The Walnut Creek School District is recognized for its sound Fiscal management and always
diligently pursues all available sources of funding

•	It is easy to suggest that we can get additional funding from the State However, education dollars
from the State’s budget surplus have largely been given to poorly performing districts.

5

•	Test scores have shown that lower class size makes students more successful. However, the Stale
has no plum to provide funds to lower class size in grades 4-8. Measure C is our only option.

•	With added State money, our teachers did receive a pay increase this school year, but this still
leaves them in the lower third of districts in Contra Costa County. Our teachers work extremely hard
and arc key to our success, but no funds from Measure C will he used for salary increases.

•	An optional Senior Citizen Exemption is available because we do not want to be a burden to seniors
on fixed incomes. This is the fair thing to do.

Please join us and hundreds of volunteers working to pass Measure C to ensure the future success of
our students!
