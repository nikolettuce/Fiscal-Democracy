CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE J
[Submitted pursuant to Elections Code 9280]

Measure J is a special parcel tax placed on the ballot by the Orinda City Council. If approved by
the voters, this Measure would increase and modify the City’s existing library parcel tax. That
parcel tax was approved by the voters in 2008.

Under the existing library parcel tax, the rate is $39 per year for single family residences, or
equivalent units. The City of Orinda uses revenue from the existing parcel tax to fund operation
of the Orinda Library. For example, Contra Costa County, which operates the Orinda Library,
currently funds 35 hours per week and the City funds 25 additional hours using library parcel tax
revenue.

The proposed Measure would increase the library parcel tax rate from $39 to $69 per year for
single family residences, or equivalent units. The annual tax for each property would be
calculated by multiplying $69 by the equivalency factor specified in the Measure for each of the
County Assessor’s land use codes. Single family residential parcels are assigned a factor of 1,
which currently applies to 91% of Orinda parcels. Multifamily residential parcels are assigned a
factor related to number of units, with a maximum factor of 10. For non-residential parcels, the
maximum factor is 15, a reduction from the factors of 30 and 60 in the existing library parcel tax.
Vacant parcels and parcels not subject to the tax are assigned a factor of 0.

Neither the existing library parcel tax nor the proposed Measure contains an inflation adjustment
or a termination date for the tax. As required by state law applicable to special library parcel
taxes, the Measure specifies all tax proceeds must be used for the library. The authorized uses
specified in the Measure are: additional library service hours to supplement those provided by
Contra Costa County; utilities, maintenance, insurance and other operating costs; repair of the
library building and its systems and equipment; replacement of worn and outdated books and
materials; the direct cost of administering and collecting the tax; and library programs for
children, families and seniors.

Per state law, the Measure specifies all revenue would be deposited into the Orinda Library
Parcel Tax Fund, which would be subject to annual independent audits. Additionally, as
required by state law, the City’s Finance Director would annually report to the Orinda City
Council on the amount of funds collected and expended, and the status of any project authorized.
The Measure would also require the Council to appoint an independent oversight committee of
residents to review library parcel tax revenues and expenditures going forward.

To take effect, the Measure must be approved by two-thirds of the voters voting on it. If the
Measure is not approved, the existing library parcel tax would remain in effect, unchanged (as
approved by the voters in 2008).

Voting YES on this Measure is a vote for increasing and modifying the existing library parcel tax
as described above.

Voting NO on this Measure is a vote against increasing and modifying the existing library parcel
tax as described above.

family residential parcels are assigned a factor of 1, so will pay $69 per year. Multifamily
residential parcels are assigned a factor greater than 1 based on the number of units

Services Parcel Tax at the Tuesday,	)

June 5, 2018 Special Municipal Election )

WHEREAS, the Orinda Library provides unique and valued cultural and educational
services to the citizens of Orinda; and

WHEREAS, reductions in the number of hours that the Orinda Library is open to the public
would limit the ability of the Orinda Library, and its programs for children and adults, to
adequately serve all of the residents of Orinda, as well as those who work in and visit the
City; and

WHEREAS, library services in Orinda are provided by Contra Costa County; and

WHEREAS, in Fiscal Year 2017-18 the County Library system funds only 35 hours of
Library services per week; and

WHEREAS, in Fiscal Year 2017-18 the City of Orinda use of local special parcel tax
monies included funding to increase by 25 hours the availability of the Orinda Library,
resulting in the Library being open a total of 60 hours per week; and

WHEREAS, without local funding the limited availability of the Library would be
detrimental to the cultural and educational objectives of Orinda; and

WHEREAS, State law (including Government Code section 53717 et seq.) authorizes a
special tax for the purpose of providing public library facilities and services (excluding
major capital improvements); and

WHEREAS, on June 5, 2001 City voters approved Measure H, an eight year special
library parcel tax in the amount of $27 per single family residential parcel, or its equivalent,
to provide revenue for additional hours of operation of the Orinda Library, library
programs, and library materials; and

WHEREAS, on June 3, 2008 City voters approved Measure E, a special library parcel tax
in the amount of $39 per single family residential parcel, or its equivalent, to provide
ongoing revenue for additional hours of operation and programs at the Orinda Library, as
well as library materials, maintenance, and operations; and

WHEREAS, the first collection of the Measure E parcel tax began July 1, 2009 and
coincided with the expiration of the 2001 Measure H parcel tax; and

WHEREAS, the 2008 Measure E parcel tax did not include a termination date nor did it
provide for any adjustment for increased expenses including: utility costs, increases in
costs billed by Contra Costa County for providing additional library hours, and other facility
operating costs; and

WHEREAS, for the past nine fiscal years, the City has used the funds generated from the
2008 Measure E as well as General Fund support, providing additional library services to
the community and supporting library operations; and

WHEREAS, the costs of providing additional library services as well as providing for
maintenance and repairs of the aging library building and equipment have increased and
are projected to continue to increase, resulting in a need for the City to identify resources
to continue these vital services; and

WHEREAS, the Orinda Library building was completed as a unique community joint
venture with the City providing the land and the Friends of the Library owning the building;
and

WHEREAS, the current Orinda Library was completed and open to the community on
October 7, 2001, which continued library services in Orinda that date back to 1914; and

WHEREAS, the funding of the operation of the Orinda Library has included a combination
of support from the special library parcel tax and the City’s General Fund, which is
expected to continue in the future; and

WHEREAS, after study of the financial issues facing the City, discussions with
stakeholders including the Orinda Friends of the Library and residents, and gauging the
public’s opinions and priorities through several surveys of Orinda residents, the City
Council has determined that the most prudent, reasonable and financially responsible
action it can take to preserve an adequate level of library services is to place before the
voters a ballot measure to modify and increase the existing special library parcel tax, and
to recommend its adoption to the voters; and

WHEREAS, all of the previous Orinda Library Parcel Tax measures and the 2018
proposed parcel tax measure have calculated the amount of the tax by assigning
equivalency factors to different land use types and multiplying the tax rate by the
equivalency factor; and

WHEREAS, the establishment of equivalency factors takes into consideration the benefit
of library services to both residential and non-residential developed properties and
approximates relative benefit based on non-residential properties having employees and
patrons who avail themselves to the library services; and

WHEREAS, 91% of the total parcels levied for the 2017-18 Library Tax were residential
uses that had an equivalency factor of 1; and

WHEREAS, the proposed measure would update the schedule of equivalency factors to
mirror the parcel codes employed by the Contra Costa County Assessor and by
establishing a maximum equivalency factor of 15 for non-residential uses, which is a
reduction from the factors of 30 and 60 included in the 2001 Measure H and 2008
Measure E; and

WHEREAS, the proposed schedule of equivalency factors is found by the City Council to
better align the amount of tax to various land uses; and

WHEREAS, the proposed measure would add $30 to the existing $39 special library
parcel tax, bringing the total annual tax rate to $69 per single family residential parcel, or
equivalent unit; and

WHEREAS, at a tax rate of $69, the total estimated tax to be collected, based on 2017-
18 parcels, is approximately $513,981, which is an approximate increase of $201,240
above the amount that would be collected with the current $39 parcel tax; and

WHEREAS, the proposed parcel tax does not include a provision allowing for an
adjustment of the tax rate based on inflation as costs rise, therefore the revenue produced
will not be sufficient forever;

WHEREAS, the City Council recognizes the importance of transparency and has included
additional oversight provisions as part of the proposed parcel tax: and

WHEREAS, if the modified and increased special parcel tax is approved by City of Orinda
voters at the special municipal election on June 5, 2018, it will be effective for the Fiscal
Year beginning July 1,2018; and

WHEREAS, if the proposed modifications and increase to the special parcel tax are not
approved by City of Orinda voters at the special municipal election on June 5, 2018, the
Measure E special parcel tax approved by the voters in 2008 would remain in place
unchanged;and

WHEREAS, in a separate resolution the City Council will consider the adoption of
procedural actions required to call the election.

3.32.001	Title.

This Chapter shall be known as the City of Orinda Special Library Services Parcel
Tax. This Chapter shall be applicable to the incorporated territory of the City of Orinda.
All references to “tax” in this Chapter are to the Special Library Services Parcel Tax
established herein.

3.32.010	Purposes.

A.	This Chapter	was enacted by the voters pursuant to Government Code

section 53717 et seq. for the specific purposes of providing revenue for operation,
maintenance, and repair of the Orinda Library.

B.	The costs properly funded, in whole or in part, by this tax include the

provided by Contra Costa County; utilities, maintenance, insurance and other operating
costs; repair of the library building and its systems and equipment; replacement of worn

A.	All revenue generated by this tax will be used for the specific library
purposes identified above and will be deposited in a special fund to be known as the
Orinda Library Parcel Tax Fund.

EXHIBIT A - FULL TEXT OF PROPOSED ORDINANCE
(Proposed Ordinance Subject To Approval By
2/3 Voters At June 5, 2018 Special Municipal Election)

allocated cost share for portions of the Orinda Library used for non-library purposes is
paid from other City revenue sources.

C.	On or before January 1 of each fiscal year, the City’s chief fiscal officer will
file an annual report with the City Council that explains at a minimum: (1) the amount of
funds collected and expended under this special library parcel tax; and (2) the status of
any project authorized to be funded by this revenue.

D.	The funds collected from this tax will be subject to an annual audit by
independent auditors.

3.32.030	Imposition and calculation of the tax.

A.	The annual amount of the tax shall be $69 per developed single family
residential parcel, or equivalent unit.

B.	Each year, the amount of the tax applicable to a parcel will be calculated by
multiplying $69 by the applicable equivalency factor/multiplier described in subsection C.
Vacant parcels and other parcels not subject to the tax are assigned a factor of 0. Single
family residential parcels are assigned a factor of 1, so will pay $69 per year. Multifamily
residential parcels are assigned a factor greater than 1 based on the number of units
present. Other parcel types are assigned factors greater than 1 based on expected library
benefit to the particular land use, accounting for employees and patrons. The tax is
uniform for each single family residential parcel and for each other parcel type.

C.	The following table describes the equivalency factor/multiplier applicable to
each parcel type using the same parcel codes employed by the Contra Costa County
Assessor.

SECTION 1.

A new Chapter 3.32 shall be added to Title 3, Revenue and Finance of the Orinda
Municipal Code, subject to voter approval as set forth herein, as follows:

Chapter 3.32

SPECIAL LIBRARY SERVICES PARCEL TAX

3.32.001	Title.

This Chapter shall be known as the City of Orinda Special Library Services Parcel
Tax. This Chapter shall be applicable to the incorporated territory of the City of Orinda.
All references to “tax” in this Chapter are to the Special Library Services Parcel Tax
established herein.

3.32.010	Purposes.

A.	This Chapter was enacted	by	the	voters	pursuant to Government Code

section 53717 et seq. for the specific purposes of providing revenue for operation,
maintenance, and repair of the Orinda Library.

B.	The costs properly funded, in whole or in part, by this tax include the
following library related items: additional library service hours to supplement those
provided by Contra Costa County; utilities, maintenance, insurance and other operating
costs; repair of the library building and its systems and equipment; replacement of worn
and outdated books and materials; the direct cost of administering and collecting the tax;
and library programs for children, families and seniors. The costs funded by the special
library parcel tax will not be used to fund major capital improvements (as defined by
Government Code section 53717).

3.32.020	Proceeds of tax; accountability	measures.

A.	All revenue generated by this tax will be used for the specific library
purposes identified above and will be deposited in a special fund to be known as the
Orinda Library Parcel Tax Fund.

B.	To the extent the City incurs facility costs for portions of the Orinda Library
used for non-library purposes, a reasonable cost allocation plan will be established as
part of the budget and approved by the City Council. The allocation will ensure that the

EXHIBIT A - FULL TEXT OF PROPOSED ORDINANCE

(Proposed Ordinance Subject To Approval By
2/3 Voters At June 5, 2018 Special Municipal Election)

allocated cost share for portions of the Orinda Library used for non-library purposes is
paid from other City revenue sources.

C.	On or before January 1 of each fiscal year, the City’s chief fiscal officer will
file an annual report with the City Council that explains at a minimum: (1) the amount of
funds collected and expended under this special library parcel tax; and (2) the status of
any project authorized to be funded by this revenue.

D.	The funds collected from this tax will be subject to an annual audit by
independent auditors.

3.32.030	Imposition and calculation of the tax.

A.	The annual amount of the tax shall be $69 per developed single family
residential parcel, or equivalent unit.

B.	Each year, the amount of the tax applicable to a parcel will be calculated by
multiplying $69 by the applicable equivalency factor/multiplier described in subsection C.
Vacant parcels and other parcels not subject to the tax are assigned a factor of 0. Single
family residential parcels are assigned a factor of 1, so will pay $69 per year. Multifamily
residential parcels are assigned a factor greater than 1 based on the number of units
present. Other parcel types are assigned factors greater than 1 based on expected library
benefit to the particular land use, accounting for employees and patrons. The tax is
uniform for each single family residential parcel and for each other parcel type.

C.	The following table describes the equivalency factor/multiplier applicable to
each parcel type using the same parcel codes employed by the Contra Costa County
Assessor.

STATEMENT MUST BE TYPED

Yes on Measure J keeps our Orinda Library open 60 hours and 7 days per week, replaces outdated books
and periodicals, and ensures that the library continues to offer educational programs for children,
families, and seniors. Measure J funds basic repairs so that the library can remain open for programs
and services.

The Orinda Library provides free access to hundreds of thousands of books, magazines, newspapers,
computers, music CDs, and instructional and cultural DVDs.

The Orinda Library is an important gathering place for seniors, families, and children. It provides a safe
and quiet space to promote learning and a sense of community. Cutting hours would reduce the
library's accessibility for all residents.

The Orinda Library supports all of Orinda's schools, providing a welcoming place for students to study
and learn after school and on weekends. In addition, the library is an essential space for preschoolers
and toddlers, who benefit from the many enriching programs. Cutting back library hours takes away a
valuable resource from our children.

County funds keep our library open only 35 hours a week. By an overwhelming vote ten years ago,
Orinda residents assessed themselves a $39 tax to maintain library hours of 60 hours a week and to fund
additional books and services. Measure J maintains the purchasing power of the original parcel tax;
prevents reductions in library services; and helps cover the rising burden of utility and maintenance
costs.

Our Orinda Library is one of the finest in the county, and a source of great community pride. The library
encourages thinking and learning; it brings our community together. Measure J is a small price to pay to
keep our library open every day.

We strongly urge you: vote YES on Measure J.
