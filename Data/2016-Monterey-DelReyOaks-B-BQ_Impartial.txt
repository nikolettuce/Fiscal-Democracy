Ballot question

The following question appeared on the ballot:[i]

Shall an existing sales tax rate of one percent (1%), be extended for a
period of not more than five (5) years, unless terminated sooner by the
City Council, be adopted by the City of Del Rey Oaks, the proceeds of
said tax to be utilized for general governmental purposes? The anticipated
revenue of $300,000 annually is essential in continuing standard city
services. [2]

Impartial analysis

The following impartial analysis of the measure was prepared by the office of the Del
Rey Oaks City Attorney:

The City of Del Rey Oaks has placed this measure on the ballot to ask the
voters of Del Rey Oaks to approve the extension of an existing one
percent (1%) transactions and use tax, commonly known as a sales tax,
for a period of not to exceed five (5)

years. This would be the equivalent of a one-cent ($0.01) tax on an item
that costs one dollar or a one-dollar ($1.00) tax on an item that costs one
hundred dollars ($100.00).

The revenue generated from the proposed continuation of the tax would
continue to be deposited in the City's general fund and all monies
collected would continue to be used by the City for general governmental
purposes, such as police and other essential services.

A "YES" vote on this measure is a vote to approve the extension of an
existing one percent (1%) transactions and use tax for a period not to
exceed five (5) years. A "NO" vote is a vote against a five-year extension
of the existing tax. This measure would be approved if it receives a
majority (over 50%) of "YES" votes.[2]
