GOLD RIDGE FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT
MEASURE I

Shall Ordinance No. 06-07-1-R of the Gold Ridge Fire

I Protection District (i) authorizing it to impose and levy a new
special tax having a maximum rate of $40.00 per first
dwelling and $20 per additional dwelling for residential
property and $80 per first business and $40 per additional
business for commercial property to assist in meeting costs of
providing services and exercising other rights and powers, and (ii)
increasing appropriations limit to permit spending tax revenues
be approved?

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE I

Did you know your fire insurance premiums are set by the insurance industry’s
rating of your fire department?

Help Gold Ridge Fire Protection District keep its recently improved insurance rat-
ing by voting Yes on Measure I. A special tax of only $40.00 a year per residence
and $80.00 per business will provide the full-time staffing and up-to-date equip-
ment necessary to keep our community safe and your premiums low.

As our community’s demand for emergency services steadily increases, it puts a
huge strain on our dedicated volunteer and part-time firefighters. Consequently,
there are days throughout the year when volunteer engineers are not available and
stations are not staffed. To minimally staff our stations, we are forced to use funds
budgeted for vehicle replacement, leaving our district with less and less money to
replace aging equipment.

We were fortunate to receive donations for the down payment on our much-needed
new water tender. However, we are paying $24,000.00 in interest every year until it
and other equipment is paid off As other fire engines need replacement, more and
more interest payments will have to be added to our already stretched budget.

We need your approval of Measure I so Gold Ridge Fire Protection District will be
able to: continue to respond immediately to fight fires, provide emergency medical
care, and protect property; maintain our recently improved fire protection rating
and keep your insurance premiums low; support volunteers with firefighter-engi-
neers to staff two of our three fire stations 24/7; and replace old fire engines as
needed, without costly interest charges.

The last time we asked for your support we needed only 82 more votes for the
two-thirds majority required to pass this measure. This time we must do it!!

Please tell your friends and neighbors living in the Gold Ridge Fire Protection Dis-
trict to vote Yes On Measure I. www.goldridgefire.org
