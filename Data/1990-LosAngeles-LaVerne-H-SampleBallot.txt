ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION H	-

our quality of life? This is the difficult
question each of us in Southern California must answer. In La Verne, we are
also faced with this question.

Revenues to the City have not kept pace with inflation and increasing demands
for service. Bedroom communities like La Verne lack a sufficient commercial/
industrial base to offset rising costs. Service levels in fire, police, and parks have
already been reduced.

In La Verne, we enjoy a high quality of life. If we are to maintain quality
services, we must find sources of revenue beyond existing sales and property
taxes. We are asking you to support an assessment of up to $96 per year for
the next ten years to finance fire, police, parks and municipal services. This
proposed tax is an assessment district that could generate up to $1.2 million
annually. Consistent with the current budget, the City will devote 67% of the
new revenue to fire and police and 33% to parks and other municipal services.
While there are other competing bond and tax issues, your “Yes” vote on this
measure will bring you services more directly than any other vote you can cast.

If we do not pass this advisory measure, we will continue to see a gradual and
gnawing erosion of services — fewer firefighters and police officers per capita,
antiquated equipment, parks maintenance at lower levels, slower response
times on public safety calls and the like. La Verne has been blessed by a good
quality of life. We urge you to vote “Yes” on this advisory measure to keep
it that way. The ultimate question is — are we willing to pay an additional 26$
per day to preserve our quality of life?
