The five Lafayette schools are ranked among the best in the state: Stanley Intermediate, Burton
Valley, Happy Valley, Lafayette, and Sprmghili.

Unfortunately, severe cutbacks in state educational funding threaten our schools. Despite
increasing enrollment, our schools will receive significantly less money than in previous years.

til

In the three years from 1988 to 1991. Lafayette schools have been forced to reduce our real
per student educational costs approximately 7.3'*. Annual educational spending in Lafayette
is now almost $1,400 per student less than the national average and $1,000 less than the state
average. Next year’s state budget will result in further school program cuts.

To offset the state cutbacks in funding to education. Measure A has been proposed and deserves
your support.

Without funds from Measure A, Lafayette schools will have to increase class size and eliminate
or sharply cut back critical educational programs.

Funds from Measure A will provide for:

•	Maintenance of existing class size.

•	Providing essential computer, math and science curriculum and instruction.

•	Purchase of up-to-date textbooks, educational materials, and library books.

Measure A will cost each property owner eighty-four dollars per year, just $7 per month. This
cost is deductible on federal and state taxes.

All funds generated by Measure A will stay in Lafayette to benefit Lafayette schools and
Lafayette children.

Measure A funds will only be used for instructional programs and may not be used for adminis-
trative expenses.
