MEASURE V
CITY OF RIALTO

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE V

This Impartial Analysis for Measure V has been prepared by the City
Attorney pursuant to Section 9280 of the Elections Code of the State of
California.

Measure V will increase the business license tax on those businesses that use the City
of Rialto as a base to produce and deliver petroleum products throughout California. The
affected businesses are few that include British Petroleum, Chevron USA, Conoco
Phillips, Kinder Morgan, SFPP and Tosco. Each of these businesses will be required to
pay a license tax in the sum of $1,500 for each increment of $250,000 in gross receipts.

In addition, CalNev, a petroleum piping business, will be required to pay a business
license tax for the first time ever by repealing Section 5.04.070 that exempts CalNev
from paying the business license tax.

The business license tax will not be increased for any other business including gasoline
stations.

The People of the City of Rialto have the exclusive authority to impose or increase taxes
under Proposition 218 adopted as a state ballot measure in 1996. Since then, the Rialto
City Council has not had the authority to impose or increase taxes.

Measure V is on the ballot because the City of Rialto has identified a new source of
revenue to replace revenue lost due to the economic downturn, elimination of the
redevelopment tax increment and the state taking of other city revenue.

Measure V gives the People of the City of Rialto the opportunity to increase the business
license tax on a few businesses so that existing service levels can be maintained. The
effects on Rialto’s business license tax ordinances are as follows:

•	Section 5.04.020 defines the petroleum businesses that will pay the increased
business license tax.

•	Section 5.04.060 lists the business license tax rate for all businesses in
Appendix A of Chapter 5.04 and allows the City Council to reduce the tax rates
in Appendix A but return them in the future.

•	Section 5.04.062 increases the business license tax rate on businesses based
in Rialto that produce and deliver petroleum products throughout California.

•	Section 5.04.070 that exempts petroleum pipeline businesses from paying the
business license tax is repealed - thereby requiring them to pay the business
license tax.

•	Section 5.14.010 prevents petroleum businesses from avoiding payment of the
increased business license tax by being classified as other existing businesses.

•	Sections 5.14.020, 5.14.030 and 5.14.040 require businesses defined in
Chapter 5.14 to pay the business license tax and administrative fee at the rates
in Appendix A.

•	Section 5.56.040 requires businesses defined in Chapter 5.56 to pay the
business license tax and administrative fee at the rates in Appendix A.

•	Section 5.68.035 requires the businesses defined in Chapter 5.68 to pay the
business license tax and administrative fee at the rates in Appendix A.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE V

This Argument in Favor of Measure V was submitted pursuant to Section
9282 of the Elections Code of the State of California. It is the opinion of
the author(s), and has been printed exactly as submitted.

The City of Rialto exists to provide you, its residents, with a safe, healthy and
prosperous place to live, raise your family and work.

Mindful of this purpose, the City of Rialto has made every effort to provide the level of
services that you need and have come to expect in our community.

Our efforts have been compromised greatly by the downturn in the economy, as the
downturn has reduced the City’s revenues including property taxes, sales taxes and
the state legislature has eliminated redevelopment tax increment revenues.

In particular, the economic downturn has reduced the City of Rialto’s annual revenues
by more than $8 Million over the last six (6) years. We have responded by reducing
our employees, cutting back their salaries and benefits, and by using our reserves.
However, we will have to cut more services because we will not be able to rely on our
reserves in the next fiscal year (2013-14).

What is the answer? We need to replace lost tax revenues and we have found a way.
It is to increase the business license tax on those few businesses that use Rialto as a
base to produce and deliver petroleum products throughout California.

Only you, the voters of Rialto, can do so by voting YES on Measure V. So, the
opportunity to make a difference is yours.

Measure V is structured to raise approximately $5 Million annually - paid only by the
businesses that use Rialto as a base to produce and deliver petroleum products
throughout California. Measure V will not increase taxes on other Rialto businesses
including retail gasoline stations.

Voter YES on Measure “V.”

FULL TEXT FOR MEASURE V

AN ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF RIALTO, CALIFORNIA, AMENDING CHAPTERS
5.04 AND 5.14 OF THE RIALTO MUNICIPAL CODE TO INCREASE THE BUSINESS
LICENSE TAX ON BUSINESSES ENGAGED IN THE MANUFACTURE, PIPING,
REFINING, STORAGE AND WHOLESALE OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS

WHEREAS, the Rialto City Council has found that the City’s future revenues
will be insufficient to meet the cost of the City’s current level of city services, which
without additional revenues will necessitate further reductions of city services including
police and fire services, and therefore seeks to call an election to allow the voters of
the City of Rialto to adopt a measure that will increase revenues without placing a
burden on the residents of the City of Rialto; and

WHEREAS, like all other Cities in San Bernardino County, the City of Rialto
has experienced large reductions in its traditional revenues over the past six years due
to the downturn in the economy that exceed eight million dollars ($8,000,000) including
a 20% reduction in property taxes, a 17% reduction in sales taxes and a 17% reduction
in In Lieu Property taxes; and

WHEREAS, the City of Rialto has been able to fund city services from the
City’s reserves in the past and current fiscal years and the management and finance
staff forecast another deficit budget for the coming fiscal year that will require a
decrease in city services levels including fire and police protection unless new sources
of revenues are realized; and

WHEREAS, the Rialto City Council has allowed the residents of the City of
Rialto to determine the desired level of city services as well as the source of revenues
to support that level of city services; and

THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY OF RIALTO DO ORDAIN AS FOLLOWS:

including liquefied petroleum gas and petroleum products blended with ethanol, or in
the merchant wholesale distribution of crude petroleum and petroleum products,
including liquefied petroleum gas and petroleum products blended with ethanol.
Petroleum Bulk Station or Terminal shall also mean a business primarily engaged in
the provision of specialized or support services for a Petroleum Bulk Station or
Terminal including, without limitation, the loading and unloading of such products on to

petroleum products from refined petroleum and businesses primarily engaged in
blending or compounding refined petroleum, including but not limited to blending
petroleum products with ethanol, making lubricating oils and greases and/or re-refining
used petroleum lubricating oils.

“Petroleum and Petroleum Products Merchant Wholesaler” shall mean a business
primarily engaged in the merchant wholesale distribution of petroleum and petroleum

The City Council may by resolution, from time to time and in its sole discretion, reduce
the license tax rate applicable to any class of businesses listed in Appendix A to an
amount that is less than the maximum rate. In the event that it does so, the City
Council may by resolution subsequently readjust the license tax rate for any class of
businesses listed in Appendix A to the maximum rate or to some other rate less than
the maximum rate without subsequent voter approval.

Section 3. Section 5.04.062 is added to the Rialto Municipal Code to read as follows:

Petroleum Bulk Products Stations or Terminals, Petroleum Manufacturers, Petroleum
and Petroleum Products Merchant Wholesalers and Petroleum Refineries shall pay an
administration fee and a license tax based on the entire gross receipts of the previous
year which are attributable to the business activities of such businesses conducted
within the City. The amount of the administration fee and the business license tax rate
of each such business shall be established pursuant to Section 5.04.060.

Section 4. Section 5.04.064 is added to the Rialto Municipal Code to read as follows:

5.04.064. Amendments without Tax Increases.

5.14 and Section 5.68.035 of the Rialto Municipal Code may be amended by the City
Council without a vote of the people. However, as required by Chapter XI11C of the

Appendix A to Chapter 5.04, Chapter 5.14 and Section 5.68.035 were adopted to
increase revenue for the City of Rialto and to ensure that, to the extent permissible
under state and federal law, a business license tax is imposed on all businesses
operating in the City consistent with that intent. Without limiting the foregoing, the
following amendments shall not constitute an increase of a tax rate:

A.	An action that interprets or clarifies the methodology of calculating the tax, or any
definition applicable to the tax, as long as said interpretation or clarification (even
if contrary to some prior interpretation or clarification) is not inconsistent with the

failed to collect the tax.

Environmental Quality Act (Public Resources Code §§ 21000 et seq., “CEQA,” and 14
Cal. Code Reg. §§ 15000 et seq., “CEQA Guidelines”). This Ordinance amends the
City’s Business License Tax, which is a general tax that can be used for any legitimate
governmental purpose; it is not a commitment to any particular action. As such, under
CEQA Guidelines section 15378(b)(4), the Ordinance is not a project within the
meaning of CEQA because it creates a government funding mechanism that does not
involve any commitment to any specific project that may result in a potentially
significant physical impact on the environment. If revenue from the tax were used for a
purpose that would have either such effect, the city would undertake the required
CEQA review for that particular project. Therefore, pursuant to CEQA Guidelines
section 15060 CEQA analyses is not required.
