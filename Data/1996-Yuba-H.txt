<impartial> IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF COUNTY COUNSEL
MEASURE H

Yuba County currently has a Transient Occupancy Tax in place.
This tax is imposed upon and is collected by the businesses
affected from transient renters staying at hotels, motels, and
boarding houses operated by the businesses subject to the
Transient Occupancy Tax. The tax rate is currently 8 percent of
the room rate.

This measure, if approved, would continue the Transient
Occupancy Tax in effect and at its present rate of 8 percent.

Based on experience since adoption of the Transient Occupancy
Tax currently in effect, failure of this measure would result in a
loss of approximately $32,000 per year in revenue.

This measure may be passed by a simple majority (50 percent
plus 1) affirmative vote of the voters voting. <impartialend>

<favor> ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE H

Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) on Hotels and Motels

Yuba County has collected an 8% TOT (Transient Occupancy Tax)
on hotel and motel rooms since 1990. Due to a recent court case,
the County now needs voter approval to continue collecting this tax.
Through the TOT, users of these facilities, most of whom are
out-of-town visitors, pay their share for local services, decreasing the
burden on local taxpayers.

If this measure is not passed by a majority of the voters, Yuba
County will lose approximately $32,000 annually that it previously
had collected from this source. This will result in reduced funding
for public services such as the library, veteransâ€™ services, and
emergency services. As your elected representatives, we urge you
to support this ballot measure. <favorend>
