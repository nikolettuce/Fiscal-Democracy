ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE D

The Marinwood Community Services District Board asks your support
for this measure. The fire-tax rate has not been increased for more
than ten years, even though costs and expenses over which the
Board has no control continue ever upward. For example, workers
compensation insurance increased more than $40,000 this , year
alone, almost double from last year.

Even in the face of a loss of over 15% total tax revenue that the State
has taken from us to finance schools, we have had a balanced,
though lean, budget and have continued to maintain a high level of fire
service. Over the past ten years we have lost over $1,300,000
property taxes to the State.

We have some of the best trained firefighters in the County who
willingly provide extended services such as home-safety inspections,
smoke-detector checks, and protection from rain and flooding.

The CSD Board members, your elected neighbors, have
conscientiously considered this matter and after much deliberation
have determined that this measure is necessary.
