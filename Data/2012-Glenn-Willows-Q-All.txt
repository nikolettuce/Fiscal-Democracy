AGENDA ITEM

Honorable Mayor Holvik and Members of City Council
Steve Holsinger, City Manager

June 26, 2012

TO:

FROM:

SUBJECT:	Consideration	and	possible	approval	of a Sales & Use Tax and/or a Hotel Users Tax Measure(s)

to be placed on the November 2012 Consolidated General Election in Glenn County.

RECOMMENDATION

Staff is recommending approval, by Resolution of the City Council, a Hotel Users Tax Measure for the upcoming
November 2012 elections process in Glenn County.

SUMMARY

During this past year, the City Council hired special consultant, William Berry to conduct a survey on potential tax
measures within Glenn County. The results of the survey process were reviewed with the City Council during a
special mid-year budget review session in early February this year. It was subsequently determined that there
was not sufficient time available to complete the steps necessary to place an item on the June Primary Election
Ballot. Additionally, it was suggested the June primary results may provide valuable data to assist staff and
council in the final decision making process concerning placing items on the November ballot.

This past May 22nd, Mr. Berry presented additional information to the council concerning development of tax
measure language, funding options for advertising and/or soliciting voter support and potential legal reviews as
required by State Elections Law. Following the June 5th primary, staff reviewed some data provided by the
League of California Cities concerning elections results. Based upon staff interpretation of these election results,
it is not recommended that the City of Willows pursue a sales & use tax measure at this time. However, it may be
prudent at this time to seek an increase in Hotel Users Tax by 2%; since city expenses over the past decade
have increased by over 60%, yet there has been no consideration for increasing this potential revenue offset.
Travelers in our community often benefit from the array of city services provided. A TOT increase is an equitable
way to recover a portion of service expenses without placing any additional tax burdens on local residents and
business owners. Staff is recommending approval of the proposed TOT increase.

FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS:

Expenses for the upcoming General Election are allocated in the 2012/13 fiscal work plan. It is not anticipated
that expenditures relative to this single tax measure will exceed the budgeted funding.

RECOMMENDATION

Staff is recommending approval, by Resolution of the City Council, a Hotel Users Tax Measure for the upcoming
November 2012 elections process in Glenn County____________________________________________

PASSED AND ADOPTED by the City Council of the City of

AYES:

NOES :

ABSENT:

Approved:

Attest:

Vince Holvik, Mayor

Natalie Butler, City Clerk

Arguments Supporting Adoption of a 12% Hotel User Tax

1.	The City currently has an ordinance which establishes a “Hotel User Tax” (HUT) for occupancy
in any hotel or motel within the City of Willows.

2.	The current HUT is 10% of the room rate and has not been adjusted for ten years. It was raised
from 8% to 10% in November 2000.

3.	The HUT is not a general property tax imposed upon local property owners.

4.	The HUT is not a tax imposed upon local hotel or motel owners/operators.

5.	The HUT will only apply to those visitors who stay in a hotel or motel within the City of
Willows.

6.	Visitors to our community make use of city services and facilities during their stay in the City of
Willows. The revenues generated from the HUT assist the city in maintaining the level of services
and facilities in our city without creating an additional financial burden on our residents and
property owners.

7.	The City Council has proposed amending the City’s Ordinance to increase the HUT rate from
10% to 12%. Such an amendment requires local voter approval in accordance with State Law.

8.	The proposed increase in HUT is required to partially off-set significant city services
expenditures which have increased by over sixty percent (60%) during the period between 2000 -
2012 (since the last HUT increase).

9.	Revenues generated by the increase in HUT are general fund revenues which will be used to
sustain or expand many municipal activities deemed priorities by the City Council, including:

Fire Department, Police patrol. Library services, Recreation programming, the local swimming
pool, Parks and Public Works services, including street sweeping, leaf pick-up, sanitary sewer
collection, transmission, treatment and disposal.

CITY OF WILLOWS MEASURE
TO INCREASE THE HOTEL USERS TAX

Impartial Analysis by the City Attorney

Section 3.25.030 of the City of Willows Municipal Code currently imposes a ten percent
(10%) “Hotel Users Tax,” on persons occupying “Hotels” in the City of Willows. The
City Council of the City of Willows desires to enact an ordinance amending Section

3.25.030	to increase the Hotel Users Tax to 12%. Therefore, the City Council is
submitting the following question to the voters at the general municipal election to be
held in the City of Willows on Tuesday, November 6, 2012:

“Shall the ordinance increasing the Hotel Users Tax from ten
percent (10%) to twelve percent (12%) be adopted?”

The Tax is normally paid by the hotel user to the operator of the hotel at the time payment
for the room rental is made. The hotel operator is required to collect the tax, and the
operator remits the tax to the City of Willows. The tax revenues are paid into the City’s
General Fund and used to pay for municipal activities and services including police
protection, fire protection, library, recreational programs and public works.

The California Constitution, Article 13C requires that “No local government may impose,
extend or increase any general tax unless and until that tax is submitted to the electorate
and approved by a majority vote.” This measure is therefore submitted to the electorate
for their approval or rejection.

A “Yes” vote would approve the adoption by ordinance of a twelve percent (12%) “Hotel
Users Tax” and would increase the City’s General Fund revenues by approximately
$80,000.00.

A “No” vote would reject the measure and would mean that the City’s revenues from the
“Hotel Users Tax” would remain at ten percent (10%).

The above statement is an impartial analysis of the City of Willows Measure to
increase the Hotel Users Tax. If you desire a copy of the ordinance or measure,
please call the office of the City Clerk at (530) 934-7041 and a copy will be mailed at
no cost to you.

CITY OF WILLOWS MEASURE
TO INCREASE THE HOTEL USERS TAX

Impartial Analysis by the City Attorney

Section 3.25.030 of the City of Willows Municipal Code currently imposes a ten percent
(10%) “Hotel Users Tax,” on persons occupying “Hotels” in the City of Willows. The
City Council of the City of Willows desires to enact an ordinance amending Section

3.25.030	to increase the Hotel Users Tax to 12%. Therefore, the City Council is
submitting the following question to the voters at the general municipal election to be
held in the City of Willows on Tuesday, November 6, 2012:

“Shall the ordinance increasing the Hotel Users Tax from ten
percent (10%) to twelve percent (12%) be adopted?”

The Tax is normally paid by the hotel user to the operator of the hotel at the time payment
for the room rental is made. The hotel operator is required to collect the tax, and the
operator remits the tax to the City of Willows. The tax revenues are paid into the City’s
General Fund and used to pay for municipal activities and services including police
protection, fire protection, library, recreational programs and public works.

The California Constitution, Article 13C requires that “No local government may impose,
extend or increase any general tax unless and until that tax is submitted to the electorate
and approved by a majority vote.” This measure is therefore submitted to the electorate
for their approval or rejection.

A “Yes” vote would approve the adoption by ordinance of a twelve percent (12%) “Hotel
Users Tax” and would increase the City’s General Fund revenues by approximately
$80,000.00.

A “No” vote would reject the measure and would mean that the City’s revenues from the
