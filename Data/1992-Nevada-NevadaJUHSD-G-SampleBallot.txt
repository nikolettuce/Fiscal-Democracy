COUNTY COUNSEL’S
IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE G

The Governing Board of the Nevada Joint Union High
School District is requesting the approval of the voters
within the District to "increase the tax rate" at which real
and personal property within the District is taxed, by an
amount not to exceed 3-3/4 cents ($.0375) for each $100
of assessed valuation. The proceeds of this tax increase
will be used solely for the purpose of acquiring and/or
leasing real property and having new school buildings
constructed thereon. The District would also be allowed
to use the proceeds to reconstruct, remodel and expand
both Nevada Union and Bear River High Schools.
Approval of this measure will require a majority vote of
the votes cast hereon.

Legally, under the provisions of Education Code Sec.
39308.5, the present proposal,does not constitute a new
tax but is considered as coming within the original tax
rate increase which was approved by the voters at the
school bond election on November 5, 1974. At the
November 5, 1974 election, the voters approved a tax
rate increase to provide funds for the construction of new
school facilities. That tax rate increase will expire as of
June 30, 2002. At the present time the annual tax levy is
less than the maximum tax rate as approved at the
November 5, 1974 election. Under the authority of this
Education Code section, the voters, by majority vote, may
authorize the proposed acquisition and construction of
additional new school facilities and the remodeling and/or
expansion of existing school facilities so long as the
maximum tax rate increase as approved by the voters on
November 5, 1974 is not exceeded. The authority
obtained by the passage of this measure will expire as of
June 30, 2002.

The effect of this measure will be to extend the District’s
authority to collect and to expend the proceeds of the tax
increase as approved in 1974. Unless the measure is
approved, when the school facilities which were part of
the original approval from 1974 are fully paid for, the
District would no longer be able to collect or to spend the
additional taxes as approved in 1974.

DATED: August 17, 1992

Both recent arrivals and long time residents of Nevada
County are proud of the quality of our public schools.
Good schools are a reflection of the quality of life that
draws us and keeps us here. They are important to ail of
us, not just those who have school age children.

Recently, a group of citizens visited Nevada Union High
School and saw first hand the facility needs which are
addressed in Measure G. The few science laboratories
are an embarrassment. The library is inadequate and
because of current classroom shortages, it frequently
doubles as a classroom. Even the opposition to Measure
G doesn’t argue the need for new construction.

California State Department of Finance statistics show
that our county’s high school population will grow from the
current, 3,794 to 6,079 in the next eight years -- a 60%
increase. These numbers are based on students
currently enrolled in the elementary and middle schools.
These increases will further burden an already
overcrowded Nevada Union, built 30 years ago, and will
require continued expansion at Bear River High.

We cannot wait ten years to accumulate unreliable
mitigation fees to pay for the needed construction.
Measure G will cost the average homeowner less than
$40 per year for a ten-year period, raising the needed
$10.8 million now. We consider this a wise investment in
our children’s and our community’s future. Please join us
in supporting Measure G.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT
_________IN	FAVOR	OF	MEASURE G____________

The proponents of Measure G say that we must pass
Measure G to raise $11.2 million so that the High School
District can accommodate the projected increased student
enrollment during the next several years. They also infer
that the quality of education in our high schools could
suffer without Measure G money. We disagree with
these statements!

The High School District’s 1992-93 budget indicates there
is $6.5 million in the Capital Facilities Fund. $4.3 million
is being held in reserve for "Debt Service", while $2.2
million is "unencumbered." The District receives
approximately $1.0 million each year in additional
Mitigation Fee money. We believe this money should be
used for needed capital improvements and portable
classrooms to accommodate the growth that might occur.

With proper planning, construction scheduling and
management of debt, we believe the existing Capital
Facilities Funds together with the annual Mitigation Fee
money will provide the District with enough money to
accommodate growth and construct the listed major
capital improvements. Students wjll be housed and the
quality of education will not suffer!

The proponents of Measure G claim it "will cost the
average homeowner less than $40.00 per year for a ten-
year period". If your home is assessed for $170,000, you
will pay $63.75 per year. Measure G will increase your
taxes with only a majority vote; not the 2/3 required by
Proposition 13. Mitigation Fee money should be used to
pay for future growth; NOT property tax money!

The Nevada Joint Union High School District has again
placed Measure A, now designated Measure G, before
the voters. Because Measure G is tied to a pre-
Proposition 13 Bond Issue it requires only a simple
majority to pass. This circumvents the 2/3 majority
requirement of Proposition 13.

The School District is asking the voters to pay an
additional school tax of $37.50 per $100,000 assessed
valuation. If Measure G passes you will be paying FOUR
times more school taxes than you presently pay!

The High School District claims this money is necessary
to pay for projected student enrollment growth over the
next five years. We agree there will be significant growth
during this period, and we also agree new construction,
remodeling and additional portable classroom facilities will
be needed.

However, the School District has stated they want to use
Measure G money to pay for this growth while they
accumulate a large, rapidly growing Mitigation Fee
reserve fund. This reserve fund would be earmarked for
use as matching funds for State money to build a future
new high school.

We feel strongly that Mitigation Fees which will be
collected during this student enrollment growth period,
and the existing $2.2 million Mitigation Fee reserve
should be used to pay for this growth, rather than
Measure G.

If growth warrants a new high school in the future, let’s
bring that issue before the voters for a decision at that
time. Meanwhile, because of the availability of Mitigation
Fee money to pay for growth, Measure G is unnecessary!

BILL MYERS - CPA

REBUTTAL TO
ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE G

The opponents of Measure G maintain that mitigation
fees should be used to pay for new construction, and that
there is ample money in this fund. However, most of that
fund ($4.3 million) is already committed to pay for
previous construction and new facilities at Bear River
High School, and much of the remainder has been
earmarked for unrelated projects.

Unfortunately, mitigation fees are one-time-only new
construction fees and cannot be depended upon for
ongoing support. Also, mitigation fees are only designed
to pay for approximately one-third of the estimated new
construction costs, and additional funds from the State
are very unlikely.

The monies raised by Measure G are dedicated to
specific projects whose need has been clearly
determined. There are already severe pressures on our
schools and students for lack of space in a growing
county. Let’s not depend on developers or the State to
solve this problem, when we are able to do the job
ourselves. Please support Measure G!
