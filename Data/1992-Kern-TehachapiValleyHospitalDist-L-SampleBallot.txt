IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL	IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL
TEHACHAPI VALLEY HOSPITAL DISTRICT MEASURE L	TEHACHAPI VALLEY HOSPITAL DISTRICT MEASURE M
A “Yes” vote by at least two-thirds of the voters voting on this measure will authorize the Tehachapi Valley Hospital District (“District”) to levy a special tax on each parcel of real property in the District in the amount of $25 per year. The special tax will be levied for a period not to exceed four (4) years.  By law, a special tax may not be imposed without 2/3rds voter approval. A ■ special tax is one which is imposed for specific purposes. In this case, the District intends to use the proceeds from the tax to operate, maintain, and improve the existing hospital. The special tax will be levied at the same time and in the same manner as property taxes.	A majority of the voters voting “yes” on this measure will permit the increase of the Tehachapi Valley Hospital District's annual appropriations limit from $262,909 to $762,909. The increase will be in effect from July, 1992 through June, 1996.  Article XIII B of the California Constitution limits the amount of tax revenue (called “appropriations”) that a taxing entity may spend each year. The Constitution authorizes the voters to change the annual appropriations limit, but the duration of the change cannot exceed four (4) years.  Measure L seeks authorization for the levy of a special tax by the District. In the event that the voters approve the special tax, approval of this measure will authorize the District to spend the special tax revenue.
ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE L  Measure L is designed to provide Tehachapi Hospital with approximately $500,000 annually in operating monies in order to continue to provide quality medical services to nearly 20,000 people living within the hospital district.  To accomplish this, the measure to be voted on is a parcel tax of $25. This means each parcel of land within the district would be assessed $25 annually, for a maximum of four years. This is about the equivalent of 7 cents a day or what one would pay for a stick of gum or just one cigarette a day.  This money would ensure that Tehachapi Hospital can maintain a well- staffed emergency room and even improve it. In addition, it would provide “seed money” for a future skilled nursing/convalescent facility.  In order to have an emergency room, a hospital must be open in conjunc- tion with it, by state law. It would be impossible for Tehachapi to close its hospital and just operate an emergency room.  Ambulances are required to take patients to the nearest emergency room. Without the ER being open in Tehachapi, it means the ambulance companies would have no alternative but to by-pass Tehachapi and drive either to Bakersfield or Lancaster, at least a one hour drive. In a true emergency that first hour between the onset and the first medical attention is called “The Golden Hour.” It is this hour that generally can mean the difference between life and death. This is a situation Tehachapi area residents cannot tolerate. An Emergency Room within minutes of every home in the area must be maintained.  Tehachapi Hospital’s financial problems are unfortunately too common among smaller hospitals. They provide many services but are too often not paid for these services through no fault of their own.  Your support on June 2 is appreciated.  Committee in Favor of Proposition L s/ Ed Van Kopp, Chairman	NO ARGUMENT iN FAVOR OF OR AGAINST THIS MEASURE WAS SUBMITTED
