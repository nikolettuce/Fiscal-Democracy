COUNTY COUNSEL IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

As a registered voter within the boundaries of the Valley Center Parks and Recreation District
(District), you are asked to vote on the levy of a special tax in the maximum amount of $19.00 per
Assessor’s Parcel.

Revenue raised by the special tax may be used solely to pay for the “Special Tax Requirement."
The Special Tax Requirement means the unfunded amount required In a fiscal year to pay for
(a) acquisition of open space and other land for recreation and park purposes, (b) the acquisition
or construction of recreation and park facilities and equipment, (c) the operation and maintenance
of recreation and park facilities, equipment, property, programs and services and (d)
administrative expenses, as defined.

Proceeds of the special tax will be placed in a specified account and the District must annually
prepare a report stating (a) the amount of funds collected and expended and (b) the status of any
project authorized to be funded by the special tax. ■ •

The special tax will be levied on all "Taxable Property" in the District. “Taxable Property” means
all Assessor’s Parcels in the District except those parcels that are owned by a public agency or for
which the net value is equal to zero. The special tax will be levied in proportion to the Special Tax
Requirement, but not to exceed $19.00 per assessor's parcel.

The tax will go into effect if approved by two-thirds of those voting at this election.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION CC

The Valley Center Parks and Recreation District currently operates and maintains eight facilities for
the use by approximately 20,000 residents of Valley Center. Limited budget revenue from property
taxes results in the reliance on user fees and leases in order to meet annual budgets. Current
Valley Center Parks and Recreation revenues are insufficient to meet the current and growing
needs of the Valley Center community.

Tax revenue for 2004 was $77,216 against a budget of $261,000. User fees from Little League,
Adams Park swimming pool users, wedding parties,, and other community groups and
organizations helped to meet Parks and Recreation budget requirements. Considering the limited
revenue from property taxes, reliance on user fees and leases, and diversion of property taxes to
the State to alleviate the State budget deficit, an alternate and more reliable source of revenue
must be found in order for the Parks and Recreation to meet their existing budget requirements
and implement their Master Plan.

To place the Parks and Recreation District on sound economic footing, an annual assessment of
$19 per parcel (37 cents per week) is proposed under Proposition CC. Your approval of this
proposition will enable the Park and Recreation District to adequately maintain and upgrade
existing facilities, purchase new land for future growth, and construct a new community/senior
center to replace the existing and outdated Community Hall.

Over the years, the residents of Valley Center have made considerable investments in time,
money, materials, and labor to create and maintain the existing Parks and Recreation facilities. It is
essential to protecting this investment, and for investing in the future of our community, that this
new assessment be approved.

Please help to preserve and improve our Valley Center Parks and Recreation, Vote Yes on
Proposition CC.

REBUTTAL TO THE ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION CC

Do we really need this tax increase?

Every year new houses are built here and new families move in. The Parks and Recreation District
will get more money from new construction fees which will add to the $735,290.11 the district
already has: The district will also get more tax money from these new properties and increased
property values. As an added bonus, the district will probably get something else that money can't
buy - the time and talents of these families. Tax proponents tell us there is a new senior center
proposed and that there is a master plan. Why wasn’t a senior center built when the district had
grant money for that purpose? Why haven't we seen a campaign to fund projects like these without
tax money? What will we see in the future? Will we see other proposals finalized like this one the
district is currently pursuing: our public park land given to a private land developer as an easement
in exchange for promised sewer EDUs?

What exactly is in the master plan? Won't we be encouraging waste and corruption if we make
never ending tax money available without specific amounts directed to specific purposes? The
proposed tax doesn't specify an amount for open space, programs or buildings. 100% of the tax
could go to administration fees and third party expenses. Support the Parks and Recreation
District voluntarily with a contribution directed toward your favorite project. Write them a check
today and just say no to new taxes.

ARGUMENT AGAINST PROPOSITION CC

Why not support the Parks and Recreation District voluntarily? Why a new tax? The language in the
proposition allows the tax money to be spent on many things, but it doesn't have to go to parks,
trails, open space or programs for children. 100% ot the tax money could go to "Administrative
Expenses." Read the provision details. Why vote tor a tax that Is so ripe tor corruption?

Look at the district’s past history.

Money that could have gone to parks, trails, and children’s programs has been allocated to the
school district's building project.

Why hasn't the district used the money it gets in park fees from new construction? There is
$735,290.11 in this PLDO account. Why does the money sit there while land prices increase?

Other than increasing taxes, what grant requests and other funding sources are being pursued?
What did the district do with the thousands of dollars in grant money that was earmarked for a
senior center?

While this tax may seem small* don’t forget that many people in our community lost much in the fire
last year. Isn't a tax increase, however small, a lot to ask of them as they try to rebuild?

In the spirit of our community, support the Parks and Recreation District directly and voluntarily
with a contribution. Write them a check today and just sav no to new taxes.

ROBERTA PATTERSON

REBUTTAL TO THE ARGUMENT AGAINST PROPOSITION CC

Why a new tax to support the Valley Center Parks and Recreation District (VCPRD) instead of
voluntary contributions? VCPRD needs a stable and reliable source of income to meet its operating
budget and Master Plan requirements. Unpredictable and unreliable voluntary contributions won’t
provide VCPRD or financial lenders the resources or confidence to commit to new parks and
recreation projects. Proposition CC’s minimal annual assessment of $19 per parcel will provide the
stable source of income needed to meet our VCPRD needs and give our growing community the
parks and recreation services and facilities it deserves.

The VCPRD budget is public information and community involvement_ is welcomed and
encouraged. VCPRD administration costs will remain within the current low 20% range. No VCPRD
funds have been expended on school district building projects. The cost of developing grant
applications, with no guarantee of success, is not a responsible use of scarce VCPRD funds. Grant
funds currently on hand are insufficient to support construction of the planned community/senior
center.

VCPRD funds generated from construction fees (PLDO) are limited to capital improvements and
cannot be used for operations or maintenance. VCPRD will not construct new facilities without
funds to operate or maintain those facilities. Existing PLDO funds will be allocated after stable
Proposition CC income becomes available. PLDO balance of funds is currently insufficient to
purchase land meeting our Master Plan requirements.

Support our Parks and Recreation Districtl Give VCPRD the resources it needs to serve our fast
growing community. Vote Yes on Proposition CCI
