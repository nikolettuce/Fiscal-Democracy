ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE C

Proposition 98 guarantees that 40% of the present 55 billion dollar State of
California Budget goes to fund our public schools. The rest of our state’s
departments and local governments are drowning in a sea of red ink, and
everywhere we look, including at our own personal level, the pain of our
economic recession is being felt.

It is only fitting that our public school system, at this time, along with the rest
of us, has to practice fiscal responsibility. This proposal, by the Bennett
Valley School District, to increase our property taxes, does not meet this
criteria.

It can only be considered arrogant and disrespectful toward the voters to put
this proposal on the ballot when a similar measure failed to pass in the recent
November 1991 election.

For proper fiscal responsibility we recommend a NO vote on this proposed
property tax increase.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE C

Bennett Valley Schools are struggling financially and will be in deep trouble
without Measure C.

Opponents have called for the District to practice "fiscal responsibility'1. In
constant dollars, the District has already cut per-pupil expenditures 21%
from the 1984 state average. Current year expenditures were cut 10% from
the 1990-91 budget. The easy cuts have already been made. Further cuts will
have a serious, direct, negative impact on the education of our children.

As California’s economic situation worsens, Bennett Valley Schools face a far
different situation from the time another measure was put on last November's
ballot. We are talking survival of the basic educational program.

Funds from this measure will support only the regular classroom instructional
program. We owe our children at least a basic education. To do less
jeopardizes our own future as well.

Is sixteen cents a day really too much for our kids?

Please vote YES on Measure C.
