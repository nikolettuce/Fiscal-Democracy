s/ Charles R. Mack, County Counsel

AR&UMENf IN FAVOR Of MEASURE I

/	/> Y-v f-

■ 'Th^ Davis Schdo) Is^pi0fife'for the quality of Its educational
'program. Student test scores rank among the highest in the state and 89% of
ns graduates enter college.

Support from the Davis community has always been an important part of the
success of the Davis, public schools. In 1984 and again In 1987, the voters
approved Measure Ki AS a result, for the past seven years. Measure K funds
'rave prci/ded:' '

- •. .smaller elementary classes

V. additional courses for junior and senior high students

•	r,special, reading teachers

- additional classroom ana library materials and equipment

♦	counseling and nursing services
• *n teacher and staff training

Our, current Measure K sunsets on June 30, 1992, We are asking you to
renew that support by approving MEASURE I.

Cuts in state funding have forced the district to. cut its budget by approx-
imately SI. 5 million. Without MEASURE I, the district will have to cut its
budget by an additional" $1.2 million. This would reduce die quality of
education provided to our students and increase our dependence on state
funding. This cannot be allowed to occur.

MEASURE I funds directly support our students. These funds can only be
spent on the program's identified in the MEASURE I ballot language. For a
little less than 29 cents a day, MEASURE I will continue to provide our
students with the quality programs that make the Davis public schools among
the best in the state.

We ask the community to renew Its support of education by approving
MEASURE I on November 5,1991. Vote YES to allow the essential programs
and services provided by MEASURE I to continue for the next four years. Vote
YES to maintain the excellent quality of the Davis schools.
