If the voters elect to make the City Clerk’s position appointive, the City Clerk will no longer be elected but will be appointed by the City Manager. At the present time, the City Clerk must be a resident of the City. If the position becomes appoint- ive, this will no longer be a requirement.  The City Clerk's position has become the subject of a great deal of regulation and new state law which requires a significant amount of training and education. How- ever, if the position continues to be elective, candidates for the position need not have any knowledge regarding the foregoing.

It is important that your City Clerk be a true professional who is educated and trained sufficiently to perform the complex duties of this office. Certification (CMl^ by the International Institute of Municipal Clerks can be required of an appoimt';;' J City Clerk, whereas and elected City Clerk needs no experience, education or training to manage and administer the complicated duties of this office. The only qualification is that they be registered to vote in the City of Tehachapi.  In today’s world, the City Clerk must be a manager and an administrator as well as possess the technical knowledge and skills necessary to perform the duties of this office. As an elections official, the City Clerk administers federal, state and local laws through which local representatives are selected and assists candidates in meeting their legal responsibilities.

CITY ATTORNEY'S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF BALLOT MEASURES:

Should the Transit Occupancy Tax Imposed on Hotels, Motels, and Other
Lodging Places and Collected From the Persons Renting Rooms Be Increased From
8% to 12%?

The Transit Occupancy Tax is a-charge on all guests at hotels, motels, and other
lodging places which is added to and collected from the charge for the room. This ballot
measure will increase the charge from 8% of the room rate to 12%. An increase xn the
Transit Occupancy Tax will provide additional income to the City of Tehachapi which,
will accrue to the benefit of the City residents. On the other hand, it will increase the •
price for rooms at hotels, motels, and other lodging places within the City of Tehachapi.

Shall the Office of City Clerk be Appointive?

State law allows for the City Clerk's position to be appointive rather than elective
if the voters of the City vote to make it appointive. The City Clerk's responsibilities are
varied and technical and include but are not limited to maintaining all of the City's
records and responding to public requests for records, setting up City elections, enforcing
financial disclosure requirements, handling passport applications, taking and maintaining
the minutes of all City Council meetings as well as meetings of all commissions of the
City and assuring that the City complies with all of the state and local laws and
regulations pertaining to same.

If the voters elect to make the City Clerk's position appointive, the City Clerk will
no longer be elected but will be appointed' by the City Manager. At the present time, the
City Clerk must be a resident of the City. If the position becomes appointive, this wit! no
longer be a requirement

The City Clerk's position has become the subject of a great deal of regulation and
new state law which requires a significant amount of training and education. However, if
the position continues to be elective, candidates for the position need not have any
knowledge regarding the foregoing. The only qualification if the position remains ^ . ....
elective is that the person must be a registered voter residing in. the City- The approval of
this ballot measure will allow the City Manager to insure that the position of City Clerk
continues to be held by a person with the appropriate training and education now needed
for this position.

ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF A MEASURE TO INCREASE THE
TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX BY 4%

Tehachapi citizens do not pay the Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT*) This tax is assessed
when visitors stay in our hotels. The rationale behind this tax is that visitors have theJ
same, if not more, impact on our local services. When travelers need Fire, Sheriff or any.
other government services-it depletes the resources for full-time residents. The TOT is
the travelers5 fair share of the impact they have on the system.

The TOT is a general tax that will be spent on general City services such as Fire, Sheriff,
roads and other general government functions. Since 1983 the City of Tehachapi has
collected 8%, while other cities are charging an average of more than 10%.

It should also be noted that if you are concerned that you do not want to charge visitors
this increased tax, remember that when you travel to their communities you will be
charged.

We ask that you assist the City Council of Tehachapi in having the travelers pay their fair
share of the services they receive by voting ‘Yes’ on the increase in the TOT.
