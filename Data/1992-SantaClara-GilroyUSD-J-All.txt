ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE J

The students of Gilroy Unified School District heed your YES vote on Measure J<
Measure J will help provide adequate and' safe classrooms to help prepare our
children for the 21st Century.

Positive results of a nine-month study by a community based school facilities
committee and of a broad based survey of the Gilroy community encourages us to
ask you to vote YES on Measure J to provide adequate classrooms for the children
of Gilroy Unified School District.

PASSAGE OF MEASURE J WILL PROVIDE ESSENTIAL FUNDS TO:

. ■"*Refurbish and Remodel South Valley Junior High School

•Convert Brownell School back into a Junior High School

•Build a new Elementary School for the current Brownell Fundamental
Elementary Program

.	*	Relieve overcrowding especially at the Junior High School

•Provide possible matching funds to State Building Program for our
. elementary Schools

* Renovate schools and replace older portable classrooms

By law, funds raised from Measure J can be used only for facilities and related
equipment. None of these funds will be Used for general operations or salaries.

In Gilroy, the average age of 10 of our 12 schools is over 30 years. Funds are
desperately needed to protect the investment that has been made in our existing
schools and to upgrade classrooms for use of modem technology, like computers.

A YES vote on Measure J will help provide safe, adequate classrooms for our
• children at a reasonable cost. Cost to the average homeowner would be $4.00 per
■■ month.	■
