Support

Proponents argued that Sacramento has taken much of the funding that used to go to
the City of Santa Fe Springs and that Measure S was a sure way to introduce more
revenue for city services without raising taxes on city residents or local businesses.
They pointed out that only companies extracting crude oil within the city limits would be
subject to the tax increase. They also focused on the fact that the current tax rate for oil
companies of 20 cents per barrel was one of the lowest rates in California and that it
had not been raised for more than 20 years.[i]

Opposition

ElectionForum.com opposed Measure S and recommended a "NO" vote.[4]
