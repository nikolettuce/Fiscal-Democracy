RESOLUTION NO. 112-52

A RESOLUTION OF THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF ARCATA
PLACING AN EXCESSIVE RESIDENTIAL ELECTRICITY USERS TAX MEASURE
ON THE BALLOT FOR THE ELECTION TO BE HELD NOVEMBER 6, 2012

WHEREAS, in 2006, the City of Areata adopted the Community Greenhouse Gas
Reduction Plan which established a greenhouse gas emission reduction target of 20% below the
emissions level of 2000 to be achieved by 2012; and

WHEREAS, the City’s Community Greenhouse Gas Reduction Plan identifies energy
efficiency as one of seven action areas in which to obtain reductions in greenhouse gas
emissions, including implementation of measures to conserve or reduce electrical energy use
such as encouraging adjustments to personal behavior and living patterns so that less energy is
required for daily needs; and

WHEREAS, when the City completed comparison emissions inventories in 2000 and
2006, it discovered that residential sector energy use in Areata had increased by 30% (24% per
capita) or 9,236,897 kilowatt-hours per year; and

WHEREAS, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) establishes baseline
quantities for average residential electricity use, measured in daily allowances of kilowatt hours
(kwh) of electric power within climate based regions of service territories that insures all
residential customers are provided a minimum necessary quantity of electricity at the lowest
possible cost (“Baseline Allowance”); and

WHEREAS, the CPUC permits extra allowances of electricity at the lowest billing rate
for residential customers who rely on life support equipment, or those who have life threatening
illnesses or compromised immune systems (“Medical Baseline”); and

WHEREAS, the CPUC also permits subsidized billing rates for low income residential
customers, and is considering disallowing such low-income subsidy for residential electricity use
in excess of 600% over the Baseline Allowance, based on determinations that residential use in
excess of 600% of the Baseline Allowance represents egregious electricity use; and

WHEREAS, electricity usage at levels of 600% over the Baseline Allowance equals
more than three times the average household electricity usage in Areata; and

WHEREAS, the average residential household in Areata uses 5,868 kilowatt hours per
year; and

WHEREAS, out of 9,500 residential electricity meters in Areata, 633 meters exceeded
600% over the Baseline Allowance in 2011; and

WHEREAS, in 2011, each residential household in Areata whose electricity usage
exceeded 600% over the Baseline Allowance used on average 10,231 kilowatt hours in excess of
600% over the Baseline Allowance; and

WHEREAS, in 2011, those residential households in Areata whose electricity usage
exceeded 600% over the Baseline Allowance used 6,476,332 kilowatt hours of electricity in
excess of 600% over the Baseline Allowance, which is equivalent to 2,279 tons of carbon
dioxide emissions; and

WHEREAS, Government Code section 37100.5 authorizes the legislative body of a city
to levy a tax on the consumption of utility services (a “utility users tax” or UUT) subject to voter
approval; and

WHEREAS, Government Code section 37100.5 also authorizes a city levying a UUT to
require collection of the tax by the service provider; and

WHEREAS, beginning in 1993, the City of Areata has imposed a 3% UUT on the
consumption of electricity, gas, telecommunication, water and wastewater services within the
City; and

WHEREAS, an increased tax rate imposed on residential electricity usage in excess of
600% over the Baseline Allowance will further the goals of the City’s Community Greenhouse
Gas Reduction Plan by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting energy efficiency; and

WHEREAS, the City Council finds that imposing such an increased tax rate is consistent
with CPUC pending policy identifying egregious residential electricity usage at levels in excess
of 600% over baseline.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the City Council of the City of Areata
hereby places the following question before the voters of Areata at the election to be held
November 6, 2012:

Shall the City of Areata impose an electricity users tax rate of 45% on residential
customers whose electricity usage exceeds 600% over the established Baseline
Allowance with a sole exemption for households receiving an extended Medical
Baseline from the electricity service supplier, and automatically terminating in
twelve years (City of Areata Resolution No. 112-52)?

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that upon approval of the foregoing question by a
majority vote of the electorate, the City shall adopt the Excessive Residential Electricity Users
Tax attached hereto and incorporated herein, and shall direct the City Clerk to codify said tax by
adding Section 2628.5 to Article 1.5, Utility Users Tax, Chapter 5, Taxation, Title II,
Administration, of the Areata Municipal Code.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that in the event a majority vote of the electorate fails
to approve the adoption of an Excessive Residential Electricity Users Tax, no provision of the
City’s existing Users Utility Tax shall be affected.
