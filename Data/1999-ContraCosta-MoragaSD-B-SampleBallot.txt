ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF
MORAGA SCHOOL DISTRICT
PARCEL TAX MEASURE B

M< ,«r 0 hi , will replace the existing parcel fax due to expire on July 1,2000, wtU allow the
M .13 , < tt»< U'sinct to continue to provide the highest quality educational programs for our
chit ft? de ,u" 8 is an investment in our local schools, our community, ami our property values.

Measure B ts necessary because the sate does not provide adequate funding to cover the cost of
providing Moraga students with the high quality education we have come to expect. While the US
average per pupil spending is $6,335 per year, ant! California’s average is $5,324, Moraga is at $4,0.15

The facts are, without Measure 8 funds:

« The MSD will be forced to cut $750,000 (more than 6%) from its 2000.2001 budget

• Cuts of this magnitude wit! require the MSD to reduce its teaching staff by at least six
teachers and increase class sizes

2

* The MSD will be unable to offer competitive teacher’s salaries, thus making it difficult
to attract and retain quality teachers

« The MSD will be forced to drastically cut funds for instructional materials and
technology instruction

Passage of Measure B will raise approximately $750,000 per year for the MSD. These funds will be
used to:

•	Continue to offer class sizes of 20 or less in grades K-3

•	Maintain class sizes of less than 30 students in grades 4-8

•	Offer competitive teachers’ salaries

•	Purchase essential textbooks and instructional materials

•	Bring basic technology into the classrooms and libraries

Measure B will raise these needed funds at a reasonable cost. It will cost each parcel owner $129 per
year - just over $10 per month. Measure B is an essentia! investment in our children, our community

and our future.

On Tuesday. November 2,1999. Vote Yes On Measure. B.
