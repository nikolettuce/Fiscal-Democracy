MORAGA SCHOOL DISTRICT
SPECIAL TAX MEASURE B ELECTION
TUESDAY, APRIL 14, 1992

Moraga's elementary and intermediate schools need additional local funds in order to
adequately prepare our students for the future. Measure B is a direct investment in the quality
of our local schools and in the future of our community.

The facts are:

* Without additional funds, the MSD will be forced to cut $400,000 — more than — from
its budget this year.

*• Cuts of this magnitude will increase class sizes and remove essential academic programs
from our classrooms. Our schools will lose classroom teachers, librarians. English assis-
tants and other key teaching staff.

T The District cannot rely on the state for funds. Cuts in state education programs have
led to the crisis in our school District.

” After a senes of public hearings to consider alternatives, the School Board determined

a request for additional, locally controlled funds was the only alternative available.

Passage of Measure B will raise those local funds. Measure B will raise approximately
$400,000 per year. These funds will be used for the following specific purposes;

*	to avoid class size increases,

*	to avoid the loss of four classroom teachers.

*	to purchase up-to-date textbooks and supplies,

*	to maintain library, performing arts and other essential school staff, and

*	to maintain essential academic programs.

Measure B will raise these local funds at a reasonable cost. It will cost each parcel owner
$75 per year —less than $7 per month. St provides our schools with a new, stable source of
locally controlled revenue to lessen the impact of uncertainty at the state level.
