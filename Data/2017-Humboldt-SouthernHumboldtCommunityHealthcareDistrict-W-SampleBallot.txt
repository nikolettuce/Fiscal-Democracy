MEASUREW

SOUTHERN HUMBOLDT COMMUNITY HEALTHCARE DISTRICT
PARCEL TAX FOR EMERGENCY ROOM CARE, ACUTE HOSPITAL CARE AND
OTHER HEALTH SERVICES AND NEW OR IMPROVED FACILITIES

The Southern Humboldt Community Healthcare District will levy a special tax on
each taxable parcel of land within the District at the annual rate of $170 on all
qualified parcels within the District’s boundaries, a special tax for a period of forty-
five (45) years beginning July 1,2018 and ending June 30,2065.

The term “qualified parcel” as used in this resolution shall be defined as every
assessor’s parcel for the applicable tax year, except those parcels which have a
low value exemption as determined by the County Board of Supervisors and those
vacant parcels which are determined by the County Assessors to be wholly or
partially within aTimberland Production Zone or under an Agricultural Preserve
Contract.

The purpose of this parcel tax will be to ensure, all together, or as individual uses
of the tax funds, continued local access to emergency care, acute hospital care,
other health services, and new or improved facilities for residents of the District
and visitors to the area. The revenues raised by this special tax will only be used to
defray operating expenses, capital improvement and facility related expenditures,
including a new hospital, and debt repayment to accomplish the foregoing
purposes.

The District’s appropriations limit will be increased by the amount of this voter-
approved tax.

The amount of money to be raised annually by the parcel tax levy is estimated to
be $1.63 million dollars.

The special tax revenues shall be deposited into a separate account held by the
Mendocino or Humboldt County Treasurer, as appropriate, in accordance with
Government Code Section 50075.1, and shall be expended solely for the above-
stated purposes and according to a plan developed annually by the District staff
and approved and adopted by the District’s Board of Directors.

The District will cause to be filed an annual report with its Board of Directors,
which report shall include the amount of special tax revenues collected and
expended, and which shall otherwise comply with the accountability measures
established in Government Code Sections 50075.1 etseq.

COUNTY COUNSEL IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF THE

SOUTHERN HUMBOLDT COMMUNITY HEALTHCARE DISTRICT
PARCEL TAX MEASURE W

This analysis of the parcel tax measure for the Southern Humboldt Community
Healthcare District (“District") is prepared pursuant to Elections Code section 9560.

On December 27,2016, the District’s Board of Directors adopted Resolution No.
16:28, as authorized by Section 4 of Article XIIIA, Government Code section 50077, and
Elections Code 4108, ordering a special election by all-mail ballot to approve the levy of a
uniform special tax of $170.00 per parcel for each qualified parcel of taxable real property
within the District each year for a period of forty-five (45) years, beginning with fiscal year
2018-2019. The District estimates that the annual parcel tax revenues will be $1.63 million
dollars.

“Qualified parcel” means every assessor’s parcel within the District, except
those with a low value exemption as determined by the County Board of Supervisors and
vacant parcels wholly or partially within aTimberland Production Zone (TPZ) or under an
Agricultural Preserve Contract.

The purpose of the parcel tax is to ensure continued local access to emergency
care, acute hospital care, other health services, and new or improved facilities of the
District. The revenue raised by the special tax may only be used to defray operating
expenses, capital improvement and facility-related expenditures, including a new hospital,
and debt repayment to accomplish the purposes described in the full text of the measure
(the “Full Text”). The tax will be collected in the same manner and subject to the same
penalties as ad valorem property taxes. Revenues will be deposited in a separate account
to be used only for the purposes described above.

The District is required by law to issue an annual report on the amount of
funds collected and expenditure of the funds and the status of any project to be funded
as described in the Full Text. The District’s appropriations limit will be increased by the
amount generated by the tax.

If two-thirds (2/3) of the qualified electors residing within the District voting on
parcel tax measure vote for approval, the District's Board of Directors would be authorized
to levy the education parcel tax for the purposes described in the Full Text. If less
than two-thirds (2/3) of the qualified electors voting on the measure vote for approval,
the District will not be authorized to levy the tax. The District includes portions of both
Humboldt and Mendocino Counties.

A “yes” vote is to authorize the levy of the parcel tax.

A “no” vote is against authorizing the levy of the parcel tax.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE W

Our local hospital has provided emergency care and other vital medical services in Southern Humboldt for nearly
70 years, but in spite of our community’s best efforts, our facility is now irredeemably obsolete, and its doors will
be closed by the State of California by 2030.

If we are to continue to provide around-the-clock medical care for ourcitizens, we must build a new facility
with an acute care hospital, emergency department, and the ancillary services such as radiology and laboratory
that they require, A stand-alone Emergency Room is not legal, and a 24/7 Urgent Care Clinic is neither able to
provide the level of care required for emergency services nor financially viable in a community of our size.

To ensure that our new facility is ready when we need it, we must start now. Interest rates and building costs are
rising. Designing, financing, building, and certifying a new hospital can take 10 years or more.

If we lost our hospital, it would cause an out-migration of young families and seniors, reducing property values,
damaging our schools, and starving our local businesses. A new facility would be of modest proportions, but it
would provide state of the art medical services in a sustainable setting that could serve as a hub for a wide range
of healthcare modal ities for many decades to come.

Passing Measure W will enable us to build a hospital that will protect the health of our seniors while supporting
and promoting a vibrant community for our children, our grandchildren, and you.

Join us in voting YES ON MEASURE W.

TOGETHER WE CAN BUILD IT!

ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE W

Whereas, the hospital district finds it necessary to “Continue" and “Increase” the existing tax for "Another” 45,
yes thats 45 more years. That will expire on June 30,2065. They have been collecting “ihe Tax” since 1988.

In the year 2000 'the Tax" was $25.00 a parcel. Since then they, ‘The board" has raised it twice to its present
$125.00. Now in 17 years they want to raise it to $170.00 per qualified parcel. In 40 years how many times
will they ask to raise “the Tax”, and by how much? They will be back.

I know previous board members had and still have 'Timber & Ag" exemptions. Must be nice to be able to
exempt yourself.

If they have gotten out of the red then why do they need to raise your taxes. Oh, because they can.

This fiasco with buying the CR school is as far as I’m concerned, is illegal & I intend to file charges in
Sacramento to the ethics & real estate boards & the attorney general. This deal between CR, School board,
& hospital boards just isn’t right.

It would be cheaper to rebuild the old hospital in its present location & save millions.

Earthquake retro: Why? Why not get an exemption from congress (Waiver) to go ahead & rebuild but to have
to have the same standards as a 6-8 story stucco bldg is insane.

Folks look at your tax bill.

CR tax
SHUSD tax
Fire district tax
Fire fee

Shelter Cove district fee
Hospital tax

All will go up as the greed will continue.

They will never expire!

REBUTTAL TO THE ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE W

While the special tax has been in place, funding for rural hospitals has been shrinking as costs
rise. More than 630 communities lost their hospitals during this time. Your hospital has been here
throughout difficult times, improving along the way. If we didn’t need a new hospital, the District
could reduce the assessment, not raise it.

Would you really prefer to be an extra 50 miles away from emergency care when your child is
bleeding, your partner suffers a heart attack, or you cannot breathe?

California healthcare district boards have five elected directors. Dozens of your fellow citizens have
volunteered time to serve on ours. Every assessment enacted has been approved by two-thirds of
the voters, just as Measure W must be.

If we rebuild where we are, how and where would we provide services during construction?

More and more elderly citizens need skilled nursing beds. We already have a long waiting list.
Should we send our seniors to distant for-profit facilities more concerned about costs than care?

Disastrous damages to hospitals from the Northridge and Loma Prieta earthquakes led to
California’s current seismic laws. Garberville sits on a field of earthquake fault lines close to one of
the world’s largest subduction faults.

Our single-story wood-framed hospital is not likely to collapse, but it wouldn’t take much damage to
close it.

We're voting Yes On Measure W so we can build a modern, sound facility that will be here to care
for us all when we need it most.
