ANALYSIS OF PROPOSITION B

By DeWitt W. Clinton, County Counsel

Approval of this ballot measure would allow the Beverly Hills Unified School
District to impose a special tax of $250 per year upon each condominium, $350
to $650 per year upon each parcel of residential real property, and $650 to $750
per year upon each parcel of commercial real property within the Disrtict.
Mixed parcels would be taxed at the lower rate. The tax would be for a
maximum five-year period. The precise amount of the tax would be determined
each year by the Board of Education following a public hearing.

The taxes would be used to provide competitive salaries, maintain current
educational standards, academic programs and small class size, purchase
necessary instructional equipment and supplies, and promote student
awareness concerning the dangers of drugs, alcohol and tobacco.

The approval of the measure would also allow the District to increase the legal
ceiling on expenditures currently imposed by the State Constitution. This
increase in the ceiling is limited to four (4) years, without additional voter
approval.

A two-thirds vote is required for passage of the measure.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION B	=

OUR CHILDREN ARE AT RISK! Our Beverly Hills educational system that
enables our students to become productive citizens in our society is at risk! We
are at risk of losing our teachers, nurses, librarians and our strong core
curriculum and broad elective programs.

TIME HAS RUN OUT! Beverly Hills schools are in a budget crisis. Our
tradition of educational exellenee is in jeopardy. We must take action to prevent
further erosion of our schools. The passage of Measure B will provide a source
of revenue to supplement current inadequate state government funding for our
schools.

Our schools need additional sources of revenue NOW to prevent even more
severe cutbacks in basic education programs.

Measure B can remedy this crisis by:

Providing competitive salaries to attract and keep the best teachers available.

Maintaining limited class size to assure individual attention to students.

Preserving the educational programs that make Beverly Hills public schools
special.

Measure B will assure the survival of quality education in our schools by
avoiding a budget deficit of over $4,000,000 each year for the next five years.
This will be done through a fair and equitable assessment of between $250 and
$650 for residential property and up to $750 for commercial property.

This is a small price for educational excellence...

We owe it to our children...

We owe it to our future...

We owe it to Beverly Hills...

Vote YES on the QUALITY SCHOOLS MEASURE, MEASURE B on
June 5.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION B

Special interest groups have steamrolled our school district on a path of
unlimited spending. These groups want the rest of us to subsidize spending
levels more typical of a private school education. Spending continues to soar
even though student enrollments have DECLINED.

HIGHER TAXES ARE NO SUBSTITUTE FOR AN EFFICIENT AND
! EFFECTIVE SPENDING PROGRAM. Other comparable school districts
j such as SAN MARINO, LA CANADA, and PALOS VERDES spend MUCH
) LESS and maintain academic excellence.

; County Office of Education records for 1988 show that these three districts
| spent 22% to 37% LESS per student than Beverly Hills. If these districts had
| the same enrollment as Beverly Hills, this would amount to $5.5 to $9.1
| MILLION LESS than Beverly Hills spent!

I Despite spending MUCH LESS, these districts performed BETTER on
! statewide achievement tests. Test results show that these districts had
HIGHER average scores than Beverly Hills. This pattern continued in 1989.

, If other top school districts can maintain high student achievement at a MUCH
| LOWER cost, why can’t Beverly Hills?

| Besides State support, our school district already has additional funding
i sources to provide quality education. These supplementary sources are:

j - $4.65 MILLION annually from the City;

I - Community contributions;

i - The lottery; and
- Oil royalties.

Taxes for special interests are never fair, particularly when most taxpayers
would pay MORE than the $270 parcel tax rejected in 1987. Higher taxes only
; perpetuate excessive spending without addressing the need to deliver quality
| education at a LOWER cost.

I

| VOTE NO! Promote cost-effective quality education. Stop wasteful spending.

ARGUMENT AGAINST PROPOSITION B

Three years ago, our community wisely rejected a parcel tax. Once again, the
School District is asking taxpayers to continue an inefficient spending program
by paying a parcel tax. Enough is enough!

The parcel tax will require taxpayers to further finance School District
spending that is already too high. None of the other 41 unified districts in Los
Angeles County spend nearly as much per student as Beverly Hills. Additional
taxes are unreasonable, especially since most taxpayers do not have children
attending public schools.

We pay taxes to the State for school funding. In addition, the City generously
subsidizes our schools with over $4.6 million annually in public funds under
an agreement which provides for yearly increases due to inflation. Now,
another tax. This amounts to TRIPLE taxation to finance a student enrollment
that has DECLINED 20% the past decade. Despite this decline, costs have
skyrocketed about 60%.

We do not need a parcel tax to protect property values. The 1987 parcel tax
failed. Yet, Beverly Hills property values are HIGHER now and remain at a
premium over other westside areas.

This parcel tax is contrary to our system of fairness in that the tax does not
depend upon the relative value of the property or taxpayer income.

If the parcel tax fails, spending reductions will occur. However, do not allow
frightening predictions about the effect of these reductions to cause undue
concern. When the parcel tax failed in 1987, school officials acted prudently
to lessen the effect of the reductions.

Our school district must make more productive use of its funding resources.
These resources are already more than adequate to provide superior education.
Beverly Hills must deliver more cost-effective education, NOT raise taxes.

VOTE NO! Send a message that our school district must live within its means.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST PROPOSITION B

HERE ARE THE FACTS ABOUT PROPOSITION B:

FACT:

Three years ago 60% of the Beverly Hills voters cast ballots IN FAVOR of
additional school funding.

FACT:

Superior schools benefit ALL citizens. Excellent schools contribute to our
sense of community and they attract families who demand and support
excellence in city services.

FACT:

Over the past decade per student expenditures, adjusted for inflation, have
remained approximately THE SAME.

FACT:

There is NO TRIPLE TAXATION!

Because of Prop. 13, our property taxes flow directly to the state and only a
FRACTION ARE RETURNED for our schools.

Funds which our schools receive directly from the city are payments for services
rendered. These funds are NOT raised through property or income taxes on
Beverly Hills residents.

FACT:

Most recently, 62 teachers and other educational professionals received
termination notices because the schools can NO LONGER PAY THEIR
SALARIES without additional recurring sources of funding.

FACT:

Without passage of Proposition B, the decline in our schools’ ability to provide
quality education will accelerate. Our schools will have fewer teachers,
librarians, school nurses and other professional staff, larger class sizes and less
individual attention for students.

FACT:

The parcel tax CANNOT LEGALLY be related to property values or personal
income.

FACT:

Without Proposition B, our schools will suffer severe cuts in core curriculum,
as well as the broad range of elective courses which have made Beverly Hills
schools special.
