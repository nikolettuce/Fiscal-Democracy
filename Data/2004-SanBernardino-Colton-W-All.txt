MEASURE“W”
CITY OF COLTON
UTILITY USER TAX

To prevent severe cuts in general city services, including closure of a fire station,
elimination of firefighters and reductions in police patrols, and to preserve city services
promoting public welfare, including street and park maintenance, shall the City of Colton
adopt a utility user tax not to exceed 4% for residential uses and 6% for commercial and
industrial uses, as described in Ordinance No. 0-01-04, exempting senior citizens and
making the tax sunset on 6/30/11?

YES

NO

MEASURE“W”

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY*

Under Article Xlll(c) of the California Constitution, general law cities such as the City of
Colton are authorized to impose new general taxes or increase existing general taxes if
a proposed new levy or increase is approved by a majority of voters.

The passage of Measure W by a majority of voters in the City would enact Ordinance
No. 0-01-04. This ordinance authorizes the City to impose a utility user tax of four
percent (4%) for residential uses and six percent (6%) for commercial and industrial
uses. The utility services subject to the tax would be telephone, video services
(including cable television), electricity, natural gas, water, sewer service, and solid
waste disposal.

The proceeds from the utility user tax will go into the City’s General Fund to help offset
revenue lost due to the impacts of the State’s ongoing budget crisis. The general tax
revenue will be used to finance all types of general municipal services including, but not
limited to, parks and recreation, library, programs for children and senior citizens, street
maintenance, fire protection and law enforcement services.

Certain utility customers would be exempt from the utility user tax, including religious
and non-profit organizations (if exempt from taxation under state or federal law),
persons 65 years of age or older, persons with low or very low incomes according to
standards established by the United States Department of Housing and Urban
Development, and government entities.

If approved, the measure will add the necessary authorizing provisions to the Colton
Municipal Code and will authorize the City Council to implement any procedures
necessary for collection of the utility user tax. The utility user tax will be subject to an
annual review by the City Council and will “sunset” on June 30, 2011. In the future, the
tax rates can be increased only by a majority vote of the City’s voters.

A “yes” vote on the measure is a vote to approve and authorize the City to impose the
utility user tax. A “no” vote is a vote against imposing the utility user tax. In order for
the measure to pass, a majority of voters must vote “yes”.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Ordinance No. 0-01-04. If you
desire a copy of the ordinance, please call the City Clerk’s office at (909) 370-5032
and a copy will be mailed to you at no cost.

* Section 9280 of the Elections Code requires the City Attorney to prepare an impartial
analysis of measures appearing on the ballot.

MEASURE“W”
ARGUMENT IN FAVOR

Since 1998, the City of Colton has maintained a balanced budget while providing
essential services such as fire and police protection, street maintenance and repair,
library services and important programs for children and seniors.

However, due to the economic downturn and reduced funding from the State the
revenue necessary to provide these services has been dramatically reduced. The City
has responded to this revenue shortfall by eliminating waste and bureaucracy, cutting
non-essential services, consolidating departments and eliminating 40 city employee
positions. Even with all these cuts, the City still faces a deficit of $3.2 million in the
coming fiscal year.

The City is faced with making drastic cuts to city services, including:

•	Closure of a fire station which could lead to an increase in emergency service
response times

•	Elimination of firefighters, paramedics and other emergency service personnel

•	Elimination of police officers and reducing the number of neighborhood police
patrols

•	Reduced street cleaning and street repair services

•	Cuts in library services

•	Reduced park and recreation maintenance

Measure W is a temporary measure that generates revenue for vital city services.
Measure W will ensure that fire stations remain open, police officers are not laid off, and
paramedics continue to respond quickly to medical emergencies.

Measure W will provide funding to maintain our streets, protect children’s services at the
library and keep our parks clean.

All the money raised by Measure W will stay here in our local community. No funds
generated by Measure W can be taken away by the state to be spent somewhere else.
More than one-half of the funds raised by Measure W will be paid for by businesses.

Measure W includes a senior citizen exemption.

Measure W is a temporary measure that protects essential city services. Please vote
YES on Measure W.

upon any person for using telephone communication services to the extent that, pursuant
to Sections 4252 and 4253 of the Internal Revenue Code, the amounts paid for such
communication services are exempt from or are not subject to the tax imposed under
Section 4251 of the internal Revenue Code, In the event that the federal excise tax on
"communication services" as provided in Sections 4251, 4252 and 4253 of the Internal
Revenue Code is subsequently repealed, any reference in this section to such law,
including any related federal regulations, private letter rulings, case law, and other opinions
interpreting these sections, shall refer to that body of law that existed immediately prior to
the date of repeal, as well as to any judicial or administrative decision interpreting such
federal excise tax law, which is published or rendered after the date of repeal.

(c)	Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, as used in this
section, the term "charges" shall not include:

1.	Charges for services paid for by inserting coins in coin-operated
telephones except that where such coin-operated service is furnished for a guaranteed
amount, the amounts paid under such guarantee plus any fixed monthly or other periodic
charge shall be included in the base for computing the amount of tax due.

2.	Charges for any type of service or equipment furnished by a service
supplier subject to public utility regulation during any period in which the same or similar
services or equipment are also available for sale or lease from persons other than a
service supplier subject to public utility regulation.

(d)	To prevent actual multi-jurisdictional taxation of telephone
communication services subject to tax under this section, any service user, upon proof to
the Tax Administrator that the service user has previously paid the same tax in another
state or city on such telephone communication services, shall be allowed a credit against
the tax imposed to the extent of the amount of such tax legally imposed in such other state
or city; provided, however, the amount of credit shall not exceed the tax owed to the City
under this section. For purposes of establishing sufficient legal nexus for the imposition
and collection of utility user tax on charges for telephone communication services pursuant
to this chapter, “minimum contacts” shall be construed broadly in favor of the imposition
and collection of the utility user tax to the fullest extent permitted by California and federal
law, and as it may change from time to time.

3.4Q.Q40 Video service user tax.

in the City from a video service supplier. For industrial, commercial or any use other than
service to the person's principal place of residence, the tax imposed by this section shall be
at the rate of six percent (6%) of the charges made for such video services. For persons
using video service for their principal place of residence, the tax imposed by this section

(b)	The Tax Administrator, from time to time, may survey the video service
suppliers in the City to identify the various components of video service that are being
offered to customers within the City, and the charges therefore. The Tax Administrator
may, thereafter, issue and disseminate to such video service suppliers an administrative
ruling identifying those components that are: (i) necessary or common to the receipt, use
and enjoyment of video service; or, (ii) which currently are, are historically have been,
included in a bundled rate for video service by a local distribution company. Charges for
such components shall be subject to the tax of subsection (a).

(c)	As used in this section, the term “charges” shall include the value of
any other services, credits, property of every kind or nature, or other consideration provided
by the service user in exchange for the video services. If a non-taxable service and a
taxable service are billed together under a single charge, the entire charge shall be
deemed taxable unless the service supplier can reasonably identify charges not subject to
the utility user tax based upon its books and records that are kept in the regular course of
business, which shall be consistent with generally accepted accounting principles.

(d)	The tax imposed in this section shall be collected from the service user
by the video service supplier, its billing agent, ora reseller of such services. In the case of
video service, the service user shall be deemed to be the purchaser of the bulk video
service (e.g. an apartment owner), unless such service is resold to individual users, in
which case the service user shall be the ultimate purchaser of the video service. The
amount collected in one month shall be remitted to, and received by, the Tax Administrator
on or before the last day of the following month.

corporation franchised by the city. Rate schedules for this purpose shall be available from
the city. Non-utility suppliers shall install and maintain an appropriate utility-type metering
system which will enable compliance with this section, or may arrange another
methodology for applying the tax acceptable to the Tax Administrator. "Charges," as used
in this section, shall include charges made for: (1) metered energy and (2) minimum
charges for service, including customer charges, service charges, demand charges,
standby charges and all other annual and monthly charges, fuel or other cost adjustments.
The tax shall be collected from the service user by the service supplier or non-utility
service supplier, or its billing agent.

(b)	The tax imposed in this section shall be collected from the service user
by any energy service supplier or non-utility supplier An energy supplier providing
wheeling services for delivery of electricity through its distribution system shall collect the
tax from the service user based upon the cost of wheeling the electricity. The tax on

agencies as a condition of providing such services. The Tax Administrator may, thereafter,
issue and disseminate to such service suppliers administrative rulings identifying those
components and items which are: (1) necessary for the various unbundled billing
components of retail service that are common to the receipt, use and enjoyment of a given
service; or (2) currently, or historically have been, included in a single or bundled rate for
service by a local distribution company or other service supplier to a class of retail
customers. Unbundled charges for such components and items shall be subject to the
taxes established by this chapter. Such administrative rulings shall be consistent with legal
nexus requirements and any state or federal excise tax rules, regulations, and laws
pertaining to the services in question, and shall not impose a new tax, revise an existing tax

collect taxes due under this chapter from certain named service users for specified billing
periods.

amount of tax for a period of two or more billing periods, the service supplier shall be
relieved of the obligation to collect taxes due.

(d)	The Tax Administrator shall notify the service user that the Tax
Administrator has assumed responsibility to collect the taxes due for the states periods and
demand payment of such taxes. The notice shall be served on the service user by
personal delivery or by deposit of the notice in the United States Mail, postage prepaid
thereon, addressed to the service user at the address to which billing was made by the

reasonable times.

(b)	A person providing transportation services of natural gas to a user for
delivery through a gas pipeline distribution system shall make available to the Tax
Administrator records of the names and addresses of service users for whom only

established that the service user from whom the tax has been collected did not owe the
tax; provided however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the
amount of the tax erroneously or illegally collected has either been refunded to the service
user or credited to charges subsequently payable by the service user to the person
required to collect and remit. A service supplier that has collected any amount of tax in
excess of the amount of tax imposed by this chapter and actually due form a service user,
may refund such amount to the service user and claim credit for such overpayment against
the amount of tax which is due upon any other monthly returns, provided such credit is
claimed in a return dated no later than three years from the date of overpayment.

(c)	No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless the
claimant establishes the right thereto by written records showing entitlement thereto.

(d)	Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, whenever a service
supplier, pursuant to an order of the California Public Utilities Commission or a court of
competent jurisdiction, makes a refund to service users of charges for past utility services,
the taxes paid pursuant to this chapter on the amount of such refunded charges shall also
be refunded to service users, and the service supplier shall be entitled to claim a credit for
such refunded taxes against the amount of tax which is due upon the next monthly returns.

In the event this chapter is repealed, the amounts of any refundable taxes will be borne by
the city.
