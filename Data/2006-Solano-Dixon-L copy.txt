"Repeal of Monthly Sewer User Charge Increases"

The operation and maintenance of the City of Dixon's sewer system, including the waste water treatment plant and any expansion to il, is generally funded by
connection fees, imposed whenever a new property connects to the sewer system, and by a “monthly sewer user charge," paid monthly by those persons who
use the City’s sewer syslem.

The amount of the monthly sewer user charge varies depending upon the type of use or the size of the water meter for the particular property. Ordinance no. 02-
006 adopted a schedule of monthly sewer user charges. These rates were scheduled to increase on July 1,2006. Effective June 22,2006, however, Ordinance
no. 06-004 adopted a revised schedule of increases in the monthly sewer user charges. Under the terms of Ordinance no. 06-004, the monthly sewer user charge
increases an additional amount on July 1,2006 and also increases on July Is of each year through 2010.

The monthly sewer user charge schedule pursuant to Ordinance no. 02-006 and the revised schedule adopted by Ordinance no. 06-004, are:

If adopted, Measure “L" would repeal Ordinance no. 06-004 and the increases in the monthly sewer user charge imposed by it. The effect of Measure “L” would
be to reinstate the monthly sewer user charge at Ihe July 1,2006 rates imposed by Ordinance no. 02-006.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE L	ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE L
None Filed	The future of Dixon as a vibrant, livable city that can alford quality public safety, recreation, and maintenance and has a strong economic outlook is at risk if Measure L is approved.  In May 2006, the City Council passed an Ordinance to increase sewer service charges over the next five years. 70% of Dixon properly owners did not protest the increase. The Council did this to ensure funding for State mandated sewage treatment improvements. The Slate regulators decided in July 2005, what the City had to do, bul gave only four years to complete the work. All system users would pay their fair share for water quality upgrades while future development will pay expansion costs.  The City has held user rales as low as possible as long as possible. The City has responsibly evaluated project alternatives to find the lowest cost solution. The City will continue to explore project and financial options that can reduce costs and rates. Those who favor the rate rollback haven't proposed a financial option nor a more cost effective project. They have no plan!  If Measure L passes, Dixon will still be required to pay for improvements, and be subject to potential fines for delayed compliance with water quality regulations. The Dixon taxpayer will be required to pay the costs.  If Measure L passes, the State can force a moratorium to prevent development. This would impact the community's ability to attract new jobs, homes, and businesses. It would seriously affect property values. It would reduce funds to pay for other necessary City services and cut development fees which pay for improved parks, streets, and schools.  Nobody wants to pay more for sewer service, but Dixon will suffer il we don't comply with State regulations. Please vote “No" on Measure L.  s/Warren Salmons City Manager, City of Dixon On behalf of the majority of the Dixon City Council  s/Mary Ann Courville Mayor, City of Dixon  si Shana Levine Board Member, Dixon Unified School District  s/Ted Hickman Former Councilmember
