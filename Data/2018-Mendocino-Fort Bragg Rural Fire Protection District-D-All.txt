IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

MEASURE D

A Measure to Continue the
Fort Bragg Rural Fire Protection District
Special Tax for Fire Protection,

Suppression and Related Services

This Measure was placed on the ballot by the Fort Bragg Rural Fire
Protection District’s (“District”) Board of Directors to seek voter
approval to replace the existing special tax of $18.75 per unit with a
new total tax of $25.00 per unit assessed against real property within
the District each year. The District estimates that this new annual
special tax will increase revenues by $55,914 dollars.

“Unit” is described in the full text of the measure (“Full Text”).

The purpose of the unit tax is to maintain and improve fire protection,
suppression activities, and prevention and to acquire and maintain
equipment or apparatus, and to increase the District’s medical and
rescue services. The revenue raised by the special tax may only be
used to further the purposes described in the Full Text. These special
tax revenues will be deposited in a separate account to be used only
for the purposes described above.

The District is required by law to issue an annual report on the
amount of funds collected, expenditure of the funds, and the status of
any project to be funded as described in the Full Text.

This measure was placed on the ballot by the District.

This measure must be adopted by two-thirds (2/3) of the voters.

A “YES” vote would authorize the levy of the unit tax.

A “NO” vote would not authorize the levy of the unit tax.

Dated: March 16, 2018

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE D  A yes vote on Measure D will enable the Fort Bragg Fire Department to continue its present level of service to your area. The F.B. Rural Fire Protection District provides responses to structure, wildland and vehicle fires as well as rescues, medical-aid calls and traffic accidents. The District is also responsible for providing fire prevention services for all commercial buildings. The District over- sees development of new and existing public buildings to ensure that they provide state fire safe standards in construction and maintenance. The Rural District was formed in 1960 and in the past 58 years the District has worked hard to support the Volunteer Fire Department, while keeping a watchful eye on the operating budget. The District is requesting an increase from $37.50 to $50.00 per year, for a typical residence on a lot. Even with this increase, the FB Rural Fire District assessment tax is far below most in the County.  The District is hoping that as voters who live in the community they serve, you realize that the service provided by the Fort Bragg Fire Department is well worth $50.00 a year. In today’s age there are few if any that will say that they are getting a great deal through our government, that their taxes are well spent. Everyone involved with the operation of the Fort Bragg Fire Department works extremely hard to prove that sentiment wrong. Approving a budget at the start of the fiscal year and then making sure that the department stays within that budget throughout the year.  Emergency responses continue to rise each year. The FBFD will respond to over 700 calls for their services this year. By voting yes on Measure D, you are assuring that the FBFD will continue to provide the service that has helped so many people over the years.  Fort Bragg Fire  s/Steve Orsi, Fire Chief	NO ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE D WAS SUBMITTED.
