CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE I

On March 10. 1976 the City of Newark adopted the last major revisions of its Business Tax Resolution.
This Resolution imposes a tax on the privilege of conducting business in the city.

The proposed measure will revise a number of business license tax rates. The business classifications
experiencing the greatest impact are as follows:

•	Section 2 - Those businesses with gross receipts over $1,600,000 will be paying an additional
amount gradually increasing from 7'/’cents effective in 1991 to 15 cents effective in 1996 per $1,000
for amounts in excess of SI .6 million.

•	Section 3 - Residential and non-residential property rental classification will pay based on gross
receipts similar to retail businesses in Section 2, instead of paying a fee of $47 for the first five and
five dollars for each additional dwelling unit.

•	Section 4 - The classification of manufacturers will pay at the rate of 10 cents per $1,000 instead
of paying based on Section 2 gross receipts.

•	Section 5 - The classification of professions will pay $1.30 per $1,000 of gross receipts instead of
43 cents per $100 of gross receipts.

•	Section 6 - The category of contractors will pay $96 for the first $100,000 plus 80 cents per $1,000
of gross receipts in excess of SI00.000 instead of $93 for the first $100,000 plus $6 for each $5,000
in excess of $100,000.

•	Section 7 - The category of administrative offices will pay 20 cents per $1,000 of gross payroll
instead of paying according to Section 2 gross receipts.

•	Section 8 - The classification of warehousing will pay based on 20 cents per $1,000 instead of
paying according to the gross receipts under Section 2.

•	Section 10 - Isolated transactions or temporary vendors classification will pay $100 for a period up
to 90 days instead of paying S34 per day.

CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE J

Measure J requests voter approval for the construction or acquisition with Federal or State governmental
financial assistance for up to a maximum of 50 additional dwelling units for low-income elderly or
handicapped housing in the City of Newark.

Article XXXIV of the State Constitution requires approval of the electorate for low-rent housing
projects where State financing is used. The property owner will be seeking funding sources for the
proposed expansion project. At this time it is unknown whether those funding sources will include
State financing. This measure is placed on the ballot in order to assure compliance with requirements
under Article XXXIV in the event State fipancing is used.

Approval of this measure will have no direct financial impact on the residents of Newark. Funding
sources being sought will be in the form of loans of grants to the owners of the Newark Gardens
housing facility. The owners will have the responsibility of repaying any loans.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE I

Business license taxes which are paid by business owners, not residents, have not been revised in over
ten years. During this same period, demand for municipal services has gone up significantly and so
has the cost of providing these services to the City.

The revisions proposed by Measure I were worked out jointly between the City and the Newark
Chamber of Commerce to minimize the impact on the business community. Even after these revisions
go into effect. Newark will still have lower business license rates than our neighboring communities.
Business license tax rale proceeds are considered general funds and therefore are used to provide
general municipal services such as police, fire, street maintenance, park maintenance, recreation and
general administration.

The City needs your support so that we can continue to provide Newark residents with a most adequate
level of municipal services.

We need your support to continue making Newark a great place to live.
