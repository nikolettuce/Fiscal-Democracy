impartial Analysis of measure "M"

The City of Moreno Valley provides its residents and businesses with a
variety of public services. Most services provided by the City are paid for
out of the City’s General Fund. These services include police, fire,
emergency medical response, school crossing guards, street mainte-
nance, graffiti removal, animal shelter, code enforcement, library
services, planning and land development, fire and building inspections,
and general administrative services.

The City of Moreno Valley takes in the least amount of money per
resident than any city of its size in California. The utility tax is the largest
single source of income to the General Fund. It will raise about $11.6
million this year. The utility tax provides about 20% of the income to the
General Fund. 100% of the utility tax dollar is used to pay for City
services. The money to pay for police and fire services alone accounts
for approximately 60% of the City’s General Fund budget.

This measure will repeal the utility tax. Repeal of the utility tax will result
in a loss to the General Fund of about $11.6 million a year. The loss of
utility tax money to the General Fund will be permanent and ongoing.

Last year the General Fund lost nearly $3 million when the State failed to
pay the City for lost Vehicle License Fee revenue. The State is also
taking approximately $1 million from the City this year, and is expected to
take another $1 million from the City next year because of the State's
own budget crisis.

Repeal of the utility tax will likely lead to cuts in City services. The City
Council will decide what cuts to make. However, there are some services
the City cannot cut because State or Federal law requires them. There-
fore, cuts will be to services the City is not required by law to provide.
Service cuts will likely include public safety services such as police and
fire.

A “YES" vote is a vote to repeal the existing utility tax.

A "NO" vote is a vote to keep the existing utility tax.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEm'sURE "M"

THE UTILITY TAX IS A GENERAL PURPOSE TAX DEPOSITED INTO
THE GENERAL FUND AND USED BY THE CITY COUNCIL IN ANY
MANNER THEY CHOOSE. THEY BUY LAND FOR PARKS AND FOR
CITY BUILDINGS. THEY LOAN MONEY TO THE RE DEVELOPMENT
AGENCY TO BUILD ROADS AND IMPROVE LAND THAT IS THEN
SOLD TO PRIVATE BUSINESSES WHO WILL ENGAGE IN "FOR
PROFIT" BUSINESS ACTIVITY. THEY PROVIDE MONEY FOR THE
CITY’S FINANCIAL INVESTMENT CORPORATION TO BUY HOMES.
REPAIR THEM AND SELL THEM TO A NEW OWNER/OCCUPANT AT
REDUCED PRICE AND INTEREST RATES.

GENERAL FUND MONEY IS USED BY CITY COUNCIL AS “VENTURE
CAPITAL", INVESTING IN A CITY OWNED UTILITY COMPANY
WHICH WILL THEN COMPETE WITH PRIVATELY OWNED, "PUBLIC
UTILITY CONTROLLED" UTILITY COMPANIES. IT WILL BE
INTERESTING TO LEARN IF THE CITY OWNED COMPANY WILL
CHARGE THE UTILITY TAX THAT WE ALL PAY.

THE UTILITY TAX IS 6% OF THE BILL FOR ELECTRICITY, NATURAL
GAS, WATER AND SEWER, CABLE TV, SATELLITE TV AND
TELEPHONE (INCLUDING WIRELESS). IN ADDITION TO THE BILLS
YOU PAY AT HOME, ALL OF THE BUSINESSES IN MORENO
VALLEY ALSO PAY THE TAX WHICH IS THEN PASSED ON TO YOU.
THE CUSTOMER.

OF THE MANY USES FOR THE GENERAL FUND. THE ONLY
THREAT BY THE CITY COUNCIL IS TO PUBLIC SAFETY IF THE TAX
IS REMOVED BY THE VOTER.

REDUCTION, OR PHASE-OUT OF THE TAX HAS BEEN MENTIONED
BY COUNCIL MEMBERS ON OCCASION BUT HAS NEVER BEEN
INTRODUCED AS AN AGENDA ITEM.

THE ONLY CONTROL "WE THE PEOPLE" HAVE ON TAXATION AND
ON THE SPENDING OF OUR TAX DOLLARS IS AT THE BALLOT BOX
ON ELECTION DAY. WE CAN EXERCISE THAT CONTROL BY
VOTING TO ELIMINATE THE UTILITY TAX AND TO REQUIRE
FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY BY OUR ELECTED AND APPOINTED
OFFICIALS.

VOTE "YES" ON MEASURE "M" TO ELIMINATE THE UTILITY TAX

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE "M11

Passage of Measure ”M" will seriously cripple Moreno Valley's
ability to provide public safety and other critical services to its
residents.

Proponents of Measure "M" want to eliminate revenue that represents
20% of the City’s budget, without proposing a plan of their own on how to
replace it! They don’t care about the public’s safety or your property
values.

This revenue source, put in place by Moreno Valley voters, has enabled
the City of Moreno Valley to provide quality services to residents.

Vote NO! on Measure "M" to protect the police and fire services that
protect our neighborhoods and homes.

Vote NO! on Measure "M" to keep our property values going up and
maintain the growing prosperity in our community.

Vote NO! on Measure "M" to continue to expand code enforcement
efforts to clean-up neglected neighborhoods and shopping centers.

Vote No! on Measure "M" to keep our libraries open longer, improve park
and recreation facilities and programs for our kids.

Vote No! on Measure "M" to keep our city safe, maintain our quality
of life and protect our property values.

ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE "M"

VOTE NO on Measure “M" to maintain important city services!

Due to our growing public safety needs, in 1996, Moreno Valley voters
passed a measure to provide revenue to our city so we could maintain
and improve public safety and other important city services for all Moreno
Valley residents.

This revenue now represents 20% of city funds, the biggest source of
revenue for city services. This revenue has provided Moreno Valley
residents with:

*	27 new police officers and 12 additional police personnel
» 12 new firefighters and 2 new fire stations

*	A crossing guard program at local schools

•	24-hour graffiti and shopping cart removal

•	Extended library services and hours

This important revenue source is under attack because MEASURE "M"
WILL ELIMINATE THESE IMPROVEMENTS AND DRASTICALLY
REDUCE PUBLIC SAFETY AND OTHER CITY SERVICES!

VOTE NO on Measure "M" to keep more police officers on our streets to

protect our neighborhoods and businesses.

VOTE NO on leisure "M" to keep our fire stations open and fire fight-
ers and emergency medical service personnel on the job to protect our

homes and families,

VOTE NO on Measure ”M" to keep crossing guard programs going to
keep school children away from traffic and out of control drivers.

VOTE NO on Measure "IT to keep up code enforcement, fight blight
and keep property values high,

Local sheriffs, firefighters, parents, teachers, taxpayers groups
and homeowners all agree... VOTE no on Measure M!

REBUTTAL TO At 3UMENT AGAINST MEASURE "If

The same tired message from the same people who have a persona!
interest in continuing the Utility Tax. They want your money and want to
spend it in any manner they choose.

They threaten to cut those services that are noticeable. Not once have
they considered "not” building a "NEW LIBRARY" or a "NEW CIVIC
CENTER" or anything else that drains millions of dollars from the
General Fund (Utility Tax),

THE PEOPLE AND ORGANIZATIONS WHO OPPOSE MEASURE “M"
HAVE A SPECIAL INTEREST IN THE TAX AND THEY ARE NOT ALL

WE WILL KEEP OUR POLICE OFFICERS, OUR FIRE STATIONS AND
FIREFIGHTERS AND ALL OTHER PUBLIC SAFETY SERVICES
BECAUSE THE CITY IS MANDATED TO PROVIDE THOSE

SERVICES.

CANDIDATES SEEKING ELECTION TO THE CITY COUNCIL. TO
REPLACE THE INCUMBENTS, SUPPORT MEASURE “M“.

NEWLY ELECTED, EFFICIENT MONEY MANAGERS WILL INSURE
