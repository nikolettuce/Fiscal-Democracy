SAMPLE BALLOT

Measure O
August 2, 2005

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF

The Rising Hill Road Community Services District currently collects $50.00
in taxes from 113 billable parcels for repairs and maintenance to our roads
and bridge. That means we only collect $5,650.00 per year. This amount
has not increased for over 20 years.

Due to increased costs for labor and materials, there aren't enough funds
to cover upcoming maintenance or repairs. In addition, we are required to
carry Liability Insurance at a cost of approximately $5,000.00 per year. If
we choose to have weed abatement done, that is an additional $1,000.00
for this current year. Erosion control for the bridge is estimated at
$30,000.00. As you can see, there is no money left for repairs or
maintenance. It is imperative that we increase our taxes in order to
maintain our roads and bridge.
