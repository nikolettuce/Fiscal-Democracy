REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE S

7.5% Utility User's Tax for the City of Morgan Hill

When you voted to remove the 9% Utility tax just five months ago you were not
voting to reduce it by just 1.5% so why vote yes now?

The City Council still has not gotten the message. Last August, while preparing
their ballot argument and while talking about laying off police and firefighters, they
also voted to increase the pay of favored employees.

The Council continues to extort a tax by ignoring less expensive ways to provide
services and ignoring revenue that could be used to retain police officers and
firefighters.

The Council said they will restore only part of the services if the tax is approved.
Are they afraid to say how many police and firefighters they would retain? You
can bet they intend to ask for even more next year.

They complain about a low tax base. A utility tax that can cost a business $5,000
per year will only drive businesses away, thus reducing the City's tax revenue.

information given to the Budget Committee is biased, therefore their conclusions
are not valid. The Council should listen to the people instead of their hand-picked
committee. Tell the Council to listen to. you, vote NO on Measure I.

ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE I

The Morgan Hill City Council wants you to pay a 7'5% utility tax to resolve the
City's deficit. The deficit is simply the difference between the City's current
revenue and the amount the City Council wants to spend. The City has revenue
the Council chooses to exclude from.the general fund and ways of reducing costs
it chooses to ignore. For example:	^

The City Council spent over 1.25 million on consultants and legal fees last
year. This amount can be substantially reduced in the future.

The Council claims that without the tax they have no alternative other
than drastically cutting Police and Fire services. They do riot wish to
contract with the County Sheriff for police services, even though the
Sheriff can provide an increased level of service for just 2.6 million, a
savings of $0.7 million, almost half of the utility tax.

State law allows the transfer of accrued interest from many other funds
to the general fund-. The Council refuses to use this substantia! amount
of money to support public safety.

LI 6

The proposed tax does have a sunset clause. However, have you ever seen a
temporary tax terminate? Do you thirtk the Council will be willing to give up this
tax four years from now without threatening. public safety again? Council
members have not explained how they would replace the tax revenue in four years.
This tax is just 1.5% less than the 9% tax turned down by the voters in June. It
is simply too high.

The Council's problem is not too little income, the problem is too much spending.
The City can manage without the tax. We recommend a NO vote.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE I

Measure I offers the opportunity to restore a portion of the important services cut
in order to balance the city's budget.

The facts about our financial situation have been substantiated by independent
auditors. Grand Jury, City Council, and a citizen budget committee. Morgan Hill's
general government revenues, such as property and sales taxes, are less than one
half of the County average.

In addition to Morgan Hill's on-going fiscal crisis, the Utility Tax is critical for off-
setting further losses of revenue taken by the State in balancing the State's
budget.

*	Legal fees are largely driven by litigation and prudent need for legal review
of financial documents. The opponents suggest that the city should pay
unsubstantiated multi-million dollar claims and forgo the necessary
reviews.

*	The City's General Fund, which pays for vital police and fire services,
pays virtually nothing for consultant fees. The claims that these fdes and
legal costs are excessive are unsubstantiated by fact.

*	The opponents claim that the city can save $0.7 million through a
contract with the Sheriff. The fact is that detailed analysis of the
Sheriff's bid shows no savings.

*	The allegation that a substantial amount of interest earnings in other
funds can be legally transferred to the General Fund is untrue. The
amount that can be transferred is minimal and would be imprudent.

Question the misleading extremist anti-tax rhetoric. Vote for Measure 1 to retain
services.
