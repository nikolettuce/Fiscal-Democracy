those parcels on either the secured or unsecured roll having an improvement
value of three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) or more. "Unimproved parcels"

roll having an improvement value of two thousand nine hundred ninety nine
dollars and ninety nine cents ($2,999.99) or less.

SECTION V. Lew of Charge. The Board of Supervisors finds and
declares that'this is a special tax and not an ad valorem tax. Further, the
Board finds and declares that the most expedient way to levy and collect
this special tax is on a parcel basis as set forth above.

SECTION VI. Method of Collection. This special tax, if confirmed by
the voters, shall appear as a separate item on the tax bill. The special tax
shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary
County ad valorem taxes and shall be subject to the same penalties and
the same procedure and sale in the case of delinquency as provided for
such ad valorem taxes. All laws applicable to the levy, collection, and
enforcement of County ad valorem property taxes shall be applicable to
such tax; except if for the first year such tax is levied, the real property to
which such tax relates has been transferred or conveyed to a bona fide
purchaser for value, or if a lien of a bona fide encumbrancer for value has
been created and attached thereto prior to the date on which the first
installment of such taxes would become delinquent, the tax confirmed
pursuant to this resolution will not result in a lien against such property, but
instead shall be transferred to the unsecured roll for collection.

SECTION VII Purpose of Special Tax. The express purpose for
which this special tax is levied is to establish a stable source of funds with
the Pleasant Valley Fire Company Response Zone of County Service No.
4 to obtain, furnish, operate, and maintain fire suppression equipment,
apparatus, and related services, for the protection of life and property. Any
funds collected from the special tax levied pursuant to this resolution shall
be expended only for such services. Any unexpended funds raised by the
levy remaining at the end of the fiscal year shall be carried over for the
same purposes in the next fiscal year.

SECTION VIII. Election Date. The proposed special tax shall be
submitted to the voters of the Pleasant Valley Fire Company Response Zone
of County Service Area No. 4 for their approval at the election held on

November 8,2005.

SECTION IX. Effective Date. If the proposed special tax received
the approval of two thirds of the voters voting upon the proposition, the
special tax will be effective for the fiscal year 2006/2007 and subsequent
fiscal years and will be operative July 1, 2006.

SECTION X. Authority to Increase or Decrease Charge. Nothing
in this resolution shall give the Board of Supervisors the authority to increase
the special tax levied hereunder without a confirming vote of at least two
thirds of the voters in the Pleasant Valley Fire Company Response Zone
of County Service Area No. 4 voting on such a proposal. However, nothing
herein will prevent the Board of Supervisors from lowering or eliminating
such special tax upon a majority of its own vote after notice and hearing
on such proposal. Furthermore, the local Advisory Board of the Pleasant
Valley Fire Company Response Zons may hear any objections or protests
of the landowners liable to be assessed the special tax. The Advisory Board
of the Zone may recommend such adjustments or corrections as it deems
just to the Board of Supervisors.

SECTION XI. Advisory Board for the Zone. The Board of Supervisors
will appoint an Advisory Board for the Zone consisting of five (5) persons
to be selected as follows: Two persons representing the major private
landowners; and three citizens at large.

SECTION XII. Publication. This resolution shall be published once
in the Butte Valley Star, a newspaper of general circulation within the northeast
area of the county where the zone is located, such publication being within
fifteen (15) days after passage hereof.

SECTION XIII. Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence,
clause, or phrase of the resolution is for any reason held to be unconstitutional
or otherwise unlawful, such decision shall not affect the validity of the
remaining portions of this resolution. The Board of Supervisors hereby
declares that it would have passed this resolution and each section,
subsection, sentence, clause, or phrase thereof irrespective of the fact that
one or more of the sections, subsections, sentences, clauses, or phrases
be declared unconstitutional or unlawful.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF

the voters in the Response Zone. The tax, if passed by a two-
thirds vote of those voting on the measure, would be levied upon
both improved and unimproved parcels as defined in the measure.

The special tax would be structured so that the following rates
would apply, with improved parcels taxed before unimproved parcels.

Owner’s First parcel:	Improved	Twenty Eight Dollars ($28,00) each
	Unimproved	Twenty Two Dollars ($22.00) each
Owner’s Second parcel:	Improved	Fourteen Dollars ($14.00) each
	Unimproved	Eleven Dollars ($11.00) each

	Unimproved	One Dollars ($1.00) each

The special tax would not be levied upon any property belonging
to a state, federal, or local government.

The -special tax would be levied to establish a source of funds
so that the Pleasant Valley Fire Co. Response Zone of County
Service Area No. 4 could obtain, furnish, operate, and maintain fire
suppression equipment, apparatus, and related services for the
protection of life and property. The funds could not be used for any
other purpose.

The tax could not be increased without a vote of at least two-
thirds of the voters in the Response Zone voting in favor of such a
proposal. However, the Board of Supervisors could lower or eliminate
the special tax upon a majority vote of its own.

A “yes" vote favors the passage of the special tax, while a "no"
vote is against passage of the special tax.
