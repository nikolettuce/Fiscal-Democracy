ORDINANCE NO. 1071

THE CITY OF PALM DESERT, CALIFORNIA, VALIDATING AND
RE-ENACTING THE CITY’S TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX

THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY OF PALM DESERT, CALIFORNIA, DO
HEREBY ORDAIN AS FOLLOWS:

Section 1. Findings. The people of the City of Palm Desert,
California, find, as follows:

(a) In 1992, the City Council adopted Ordinance No. 679 to
increase the rate of the Transient Occupancy Tax by one percent. In
1986, the State’s voters approved Proposition 62 to require voter
approval of local general taxes. The City Council did not seek voter
approval of Ordinance No. 679 because a number of appeal courts,
including the court which ruled in the case of the City of Woodlake v.
Logan 230 Cal. App. 3d 1058 (1991), had previously decided that Propo-
sition 62’s requirement that general taxes be submitted to a referendum
violated the California Constitution and was therefore unenforceable. On
December 14, 1995, the California Supreme Court disapproved the
Woodlake decision in the case of Santa Clara County Local Transporta-
tion Authority v. Guardino, 11 Cal. 4th 220 (1995). On June 4,2001, that
Court decided Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association v. City of La Habra
26 Cal. 4th 236 (2001), which further suggested that the City should seek
voter approval of Ordinance No. 679. The City Council thereafter
proposed this Ordinance to the voters to validate the ordinance.

Section 2. Validation of Existing Ordinance. Ordinance No. 679 of
the City of Palm Desert, which increased the rate of the Transient
Occupancy Tax from eight percent to nine percent is hereby validated
and re-approved or approved to the fullest extent permitted by law.

Section 3. Intent. Section 2 of this Ordinance is intended to
authorize the continued collection of the Transient Occupancy Tax, to
validate the adoption of that tax, and to validate taxes previously
collected pursuant to Ordinance No. 679.

Section 4. Execution. The Mayor is hereby authorized to attest to
the adoption of this Ordinance by the voters of the City by signing where
indicated below.

I hereby certify that the foregoing Ordinance was PASSED,
APPROVED, AND ADOPTED by the people of the City of Palm Desert,
California, voting on the_day of November, 2004.

impart . Analysis of measure *o"

Measure "0" proposes the ratification by voters in Palm Desert of
Ordinance No. 679 by passage of Ordinance No. 1071. Ordinance No.
679 passed in 1992, established the rate for Transient Occupancy Tax
(hotel bed tax) at nine percent (9%). The law, at the time of passage of
Ordinance No. 679, did not require voter approval of such rate increase.
Courts since that time have determined that voter approval should be
required. Ordinance No. 1071, if ratified by the voters, would satisfy such
approval requirement.

A vote of "Yes” will ratify and approve the current rate of nine percent
(9%) tor the Transient Occupancy Tax in the City of Palm Desert. A vote
of "No" will invalidate the rate of nine percent (9%) and revert to the
earlier rate prior to 1992 of eight percent (8%).

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE"O"

In 1992, the City raised its hotel bed tax from 8% to 9% as allowed by law.
The 9% figure was and continues to be the lowest in the Coachella
Valley. Since then, a series of ballot initiatives and court cases have left it
unclear whether or not this tax increase required a vote of approval by the
people of our city. To resolve this ambiguity, the City Council voted unani-
mously to place ratification of this 12-year old tax on the November 2nd
ballot. The tax costs the residents nothing unless they stay at a Palm
Desert hotel. Visitors pay the tax. and the money generated by the levy
($7,350,000 or 16.4% of the City’s general fund) helps pay for the high
level of service and benefits our residents currently enjoy.

Because this tax has no financial impact on Palm Desert residents and
because the City has relied on this vital source of funds for over a
decade, the City Council supports its continuation and is, therefore,
asking for your approval in this Novembers election.
