ORDINANCE NO. 2002-08
AN ORDINANCE OF THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF
MARINA DETERMINING THE NECESSITY
TO INCUR A GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND
INDEBTEDNESS IN CONNECTION WITH THE
CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW LIBRARY FACILITY AND
LEVY A SPECIAL TAX THEREFOR, CALLING A
SPECIAL ELECTION THEREON, REQUESTING
CONSOLIDATION OF SAID SPECIAL ELECTION,

AND AUTHORIZING PREPARATION OF A TAX RATE
STATEMENT
BOND MEASURE R
(FULL TEXT OF BOND MEASURE)

BE IT ORDAINED by the City Council ("Council") of the City of
Marina ("City") as follows:

SECTION 1. The construction of a new library facility on certain
real property owned by and located within the boundaries of the
City of Marina has been proposed. The real property on which
the new facility is proposed to be constructed is located on
Seaside Court adjacent to Locke-Paddon Park, Marina,
California 93933 and is commonly known as Monterey County
Assessor's Parcel No. 033-121-007.

SECTION 2. Resolution No. 2002-133 was adopted by the City
Council on July 23, 2002, by which it was determined that the
public interest and necessity demanded the construction of the
aforesaid library facility, and determined that a General
Obligation bond indebtedness should be incurred to pay for the
costs thereof.

SECTION 3. The City Council does hereby find and declare that
in order to assist in financing the construction of the new library
facility, it is necessary to incur a General Obligation bond
indebtedness.

SECTION 4. The purpose for which the proposed debt is to be
incurred is to provide funds necessary to assist in paying for the
total cost of the project, which is currently estimated at
$15,378,290, and includes, without limitation, cost of
construction of the library facility and all costs incidental thereto
(including, but not limited to, architectural and engineering
costs), as well as to pay all fees, costs and expenses incurred by
the City in connection with or incidental to the authorization,
issuance and sale of bonds (including, without limitation, legal
fees and bond printing costs). The City will utilize available
funds on hand as well as funds received from other sources,
including, without limitation, a state grant, if available, to cover
the remaining portion of the cost of construction of the new
library facility.

SECTION 5. The maximum amount of the proposed debt to be
incurred is $8,000,000 which includes the fees, costs and
expenses (including, without limitation, legal fees and bond
printing costs) incidental to or connected with the authorization,
issuance and sale of the bonds..

SECTION 6. The maximum term the bonds proposed to be
issued shall run before maturity shall not exceed thirty (30) years
from the date of issuance.

SECTION 7. Unless a higher rate of interest is permitted by law,
the maximum rate of interest to be paid on the bonds shall not
exceed eight percent (8%) per year payable semiannually,
except that interest for the first year in which bonds are issued
may be payable at the end of that year.

SECTION 8. The cost of the project, including, but not limited to,
construction of the library facility, and the expenses incidental
thereto, is and will be too great to be paid out of the ordinary
annual income and revenue of the City, as it will require an
expenditure greater than the amount allowed by the City's annual
tax levy, and the City should incur a General Obligation bond
indebtedness in order to pay for said costs and expenses.

SECTION 9.To pay the interest and principal on any bonds
issued and the cost of administering them, the City proposes to
annually levy for thirty (30) years thereafter or until the bonds are
fully paid a special tax on all taxable real property and
improvements located within the boundaries of the City of
Marina, at a rate sufficient for these purposes and based on
assessed valuation.

SECTION 10. By Resolution No. 2002-134, the City Council-has
called for a special municipal election to be consolidated with the
statewide election to be conducted in the County of Monterey on
November 5, 2002. Pursuant to the provisions of Title 4, Division
4, Chapter 4, Article 1 (Section 43600 et seq.) of the California
Government Code, as well as Sections 53720 to 53724,
inclusive, of said Code the City Council hereby determines that
there shall be submitted to the electors (voters) of the City of
Marina at the consolidated statewide election to be conducted in
the County of Monterey on November 5, 2002, the proposition of
whether to incur the General Obligation bond indebtedness for
the aforesaid purposes and levy a special tax based on
assessed valuation on all taxable real property and
improvements located within the boundaries of the City of
Marina, at a rate sufficient for the purposes set forth herein, in
connection therewith.

2002 ballot and in any ballot pamphlet shall read as follows:

MEASURE R

tax based on assessed valuation on all taxable real property and
improvements in the city to pay for the bonds and the
administration thereof?

The words "YES" and “NO" shall be printed on the ballots so
that the voters may express their choice on the aforesaid
proposition.

SECTION 12. That all the purposes enumerated in the foregoing
measure shall be united and voted upon as one single

SECTION 14. This ordinance is adopted as an urgency measure
pursuant to California Government Code Sections 36934 and
36937(a) in that it relates to an election. Further, this ordinance
is adopted as an urgency measure in the interests of the public
health, safety and welfare pursuant to California Government
Code Sections 36934 and 36937(b). The basis of the urgency is
that the construction of a new library facility is in the interests of
the public health, safety and welfare of the residents of the City
of Marina. It is necessary to assist in financing the construction
of the library facility by means of the City of Marina incurring a
General Obligation bond indebtedness, which must be
authorized by two-thirds of the voters voting at an election called
for the purpose. November 5, 2002 is the general statewide
election date, and the special election on the bond proposition
referenced hereinabove must be consolidated with it in order to
save substantial costs. The bond measure approved by the City
Council must be submitted to the County of Monterey Elections
Department no later than July 26, 2002, as that is the date
determined by the Monterey County Elections Department as of
which measures to be placed on the November 5, 2002 ballot
must be submitted in order for election materials to be printed in
a timely fashion. If this is not done in a timely fashion, it may be
difficult to place the proposition on the ballot for the November 5,
2002 election. If the proposition is not placed on the ballot for
the November 5, 2002 election, the resulting delay in the
required election may result in an increase in construction costs
of the project and/or election costs. As a consequence, this
ordinance must be introduced and adopted at the same meeting
and must be made effective immediately.

SECTION 15. Pursuant to California Government Code Section
43611, the City Clerk is hereby authorized and directed to cause
this ordinance to be posted in three public places in the City for a
period of two consecutive weeks immediately after the date of its
adoption. In addition, the City Clerk is hereby authorized and
directed to cause this ordinance to be published once a day for
seven consecutive days in the Monterey Herald, a newspaper of
general circulation in the City of Marina, published in the City,
immediately following the date of its adoption.

SECTION 16. Pursuant to California Government Code Section
36937(a) and (b), this ordinance shall be in full force and effect
from and after the date of its adoption.

This ordinance was INTRODUCED, PASSED AND ADOPTED

at an adjourned regular meeting of the City Council of the City of
Marina held on the 23rd day of July, 2002, by the following vote:

CERTIFICATE OF THE CITY CLERK

I, the undersigned City Clerk of the City of Marina, do hereby
certify that the foregoing ordinance was duly introduced, passed
and adopted by the City Council of the City of Marina (Marina,
California), at an adjourned regular meeting thereof on the 23rd
day of July, 2002, by the vote indicated above, a majority of the
members being present, and is a true, correct and complete
copy of the original of such ordinance, which is on file in my
office.

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
BY THE CITY ATTORNEY OF CITY OF MARINA
[Elections Code Section 9280]

BOND MEASURE R

The California Government Code (Title 4, Division 4, Chapter 4,
Article 1) allows a city, upon a two-thirds voter approval, to issue
General Obligation Bonds to finance construction of buildings for
municipal uses, including acquisition of land therefor, and to pay
off those bonds with money raised by a special tax annually
levied upon the assessed valuation of all property in the city
subject to taxation. This ballot measure is based upon that law.

Passage of this ballot measure will authorize the City of Marina:

1.	To issue $8,000,000 of General Obligation Bonds to assist in
financing the acquisition of land for, and the construction of, a
new larger Public Library facility in the city, to be located on
Seaside Court adjacent to Locke-Paddon Park in Marina; and

2.	To pay off those bonds over a period of not to exceed thirty
(30) years through money obtained by a special tax annually
levied on the assessed valuation of all property in the city subject
to taxation. The interest rate on the bonds will be fixed for the
term of the bonds at the time of their issue.

The tax will be levied in each fiscal year at a rate per parcel
sufficient to pay the bond interest and principal charges due or
that will become due prior to the next fiscal year. The rate levied
each fiscal year may vary depending upon the total value of
bonds to be redeemed and interest to be paid in that year. The
Tax Rate Statement for this measure which is printed in the
ballot pamphlet provides additional information about the tax, as
required by law.

A "YES" vote on this ballot measure is a vote to authorize the
issuance of General Obligation Bonds to assist in financing the
acquisition of land for and the construction of a new larger Public
Library facility in Marina, and to authorize an annual special tax
to pay off those bonds.

A "NO" vote is a vote to not authorize the city to issue the bonds
or levy the special tax.

This ballot measure passes if two-thirds of those voting on the
measure vote "YES."

TAX RATE STATEMENT
FOR CITY OF MARINA LIBRARY
GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND MEASURE

A special consolidated general obligation bond election will be
held within the City of Marina ("City") on November 5, 2002, for
the purpose of submitting to the electors of the City, the question
of incurring a general obligation bond indebtedness of the City in
a principal amount not to exceed $8,000,000. It is the intent of
the City Council of the City of Marina that the highest tax rate
shall never exceed $0.03 per $100 assessed valuation and that
the tax rate shall expire 30 years after the issuance of the
general obligation bonds ("bonds"). Proceeds of the bonds
would be utilized to assist in construction of a new library facility
on land owned by and located within the City, and to pay for
costs of issuance of the bonds.

The following estimated projections are made assuming said
bonds are sold with an annual interest rate of 5.60% and using
the fiscal year 2001-2002 assessed valuations of real property
and improvements located within the City of Marina, as provided
by the assessor's office of the County of Monterey, California, as
the base year. If such bonds are authorized and sold, the
principal thereof and interest thereon, as well as the cost of
administering them, will be payable from the proceeds of special
tax levies based on assessed valuation made upon all taxable
real property and improvements in the City.

The following information regarding tax rates is given to comply
with Sections 9400 and 9401 of the California Elections Code. In
addition to the above, such information is based on the best
estimates and projections presently available from official
sources, upon experience within the City, and other
demonstrable factors.

Hence, the actual tax rates and the years in which such rates
are applicable may vary from those presently estimated above.

The intention of the current City Council of the City to limit tbe
tax rate is not binding on future City Councils who may
determine the needs of the City require a higher tax rate to pay
for principal and interest on any authorized bonds up to tine
maximum of $8,000,000.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE R	*..j

H s

A YES vote on the Marina Library bond issue will raise money
to build a new Marina Public Library on city land above Locke ►
Paddon Park.	vi

I }

Why does Marina need a new library?	i

r { 1

•	Marina's existing 2,300 square foot library is squeezed into a

rented storefront. It lacks adequate book collections,
periodicals, reference materials, and reading rooms to serve
a community as large as Marina. It has only 19 adult reading
chairs for a city of 20,000 people.	f	;

•	Such inadequate facilities severely limit the ability of library
staff to serve a population that is expected to reach 30,000
by 2020.

A YES Vote will bring Marina residents and their children one of
the most modern branch libraries in the County library system.
A yes vote provides opportunities to obtain library funds from
other sources.

This new Marina City Library will provide:

• 22,000 square feet of space with dedicated service areas for
children and adolescents

Based upon the foregoing and projections of the City's assessed
valuation, and assuming the entire debt service will be
amortized through special tax levies based on assessed
valuation made upon all taxable real property and improvements
in the City:

•	Significantly enlarged space for books and periodicals

•	Supervised homework areas, literacy and language tutoring,
career center

•	Expanded Internet; 62 new computers

The best estimate from official sources of the tax that would be
required to be levied to fund the bond issue during the first fiscal
year after the first sale of the bonds based on assessed
valuations for fiscal year 2001-2002 as the base year and
assuming an increase thereof as a result of reasonable
projections as to growth in assessed valuations caused by
increases in property values, transfers of property, and by future
development, is $0.03 per $100 assessed valuation.

The best estimate from official sources of the highest tax rate
that would be required to be levied to fund the bond issue, and
an estimate of the year in which that rate will apply, based on
assessed valuations for fiscal year 2001-2002 as the base year
and assuming an increase thereof as a result of reasonable
projections as to growth in assessed valuations caused by
increases in property values, transfers of property, and future
development, is $0.03 per $100 assessed valuation for the fiscal
year 2004-2005.

Attention of all voters is directed to the fact that the foregoing
information is based upon projections and estimates only, which
are not binding upon the City. The actual times of sales of said
bonds and the amount sold at any given time will be governed by
the needs of the City and other factors.

•	A large meeting room with kitchen for community
organizations

•	A multicultural/historical exhibit area

What will this cost property owners? Only $30 per $100,000
assessed property value (not current market value). If you
purchased your home for $200,000, your additional yearly tax
bill would be $60.

If Marina citizens pass this bond, the City will be able to
compete for matching grants from State and other funding
sources for library construction and operations.

The new library will reflect Marina's values, interests and bold
community spirit. It will allow Marina families to greet the future
with the resources and services they deserve.

Marina needs a 66.7% or two-thirds YES vote for this measure
to pass. Vote YESI

The actual interest rates at which the bonds will be sold, which

in any event will not exceed 8% per annum (or such higher
amount as may be allowed by law), will depend upon the bond

market at the time of sale. Actual assessed valuation in future
years will depend upon the value of the property within the City
as determined in the assessment and the equalization process.
