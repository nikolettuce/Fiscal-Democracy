AGENDA REPORT

For City Council Meeting of March 9, 2010

TO:	Honorable Mayor and Council Members
APPROVAL:	Henry T. Garcia, City Administrator
FROM:	Henry Garcia, City Administrator
SUBJECT:	Resolution to Submit an Advisory Measure to the Voters
DATE:	March 2,2010

BACKGROUND:

Since 1958, the City of Rialto has had the authority to levy a voter approved tax rate on the
property tax roll for the Public Employee Retirement System (PERS) expenditures. The
City calculated the rate by dividing the projected costs associated with the PERS programs
by the taxable assessed valuation within the City. Pursuant to State law, the rates levied
cannot exceed whatever rate the City had in place for Fiscal Year 1982/83. The rate levied
then was $0.1506 per $100 of assessed valuation. Currently, the City Council sets the PERS
tax rate at $0 (zero) following the approval of a Utility Users Tax by voters on June 3,2003.

ANALYSIS/DISCUSSION:

With the recent economic downturn, the City’s revenues have dropped considerably
requiring reductions in operational budgets and requests for the bargaining groups to
negotiate compensation reductions. Existing revenue sources are no longer sufficient to
meet contractual obligations. With this in mind Council requested that an advisory
measure be placed on the June ballot.

Attached is the proposed resolution prepared by the City Attorney,

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT:

None,

LEGAL REVIEW:

FINANCIAL IMPACT:

Seeking the advisory input from the residents does not result in tax revenue. Should the
rate be set at SO. 1506 per each $100 of assessed valuation the estimated revenue is
$4,534,000. The election costs will be approximately $60,000 to $70,000. Funds will
come from the General Fund reserve.

Chief Financial Officer

RECOMMENDATION;

Staff requests that the City Council consider the attached resolution submitting an advisory
measure to the voters regarding restoring the PERS tax.

RESOLUTION NO.________

A RESOLUTION OF THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF RIALTO,
CALIFORNIA, CALLING AND GIVING NOTICE OF HOLDING A SPECIAL
STATEWIDE DIRECT PRIMARY ELECTION TO BE HELD ON TUESDAY,

JUNE 8, 2010 TO SUBMIT AN ADVISORY MEASURE TO THE VOTERS TO
PROVIDE IT WITH AN INDICATION OF VOTER GENERAL OPINION ON
THE ISSUE OF WHETHER IT SHOULD RESTORE THE SUSPENDED
SPECIAL TAX OF THE CITY TO THE AMOUNT PERMITTED BY LAW
FOR THE PURPOSE OF PAYING THE CITY’S PREVIOUSLY INCURRED
AND VOTER APPROVED PUBLIC EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT SYSTEM
OBLIGATION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2009/2010

WHEREAS, the State of California established a permanent moratorium on the ability of
California cities to fund their retirement system by a property tax or assessment, with the exception of
obligations to make PERS contributions incurred prior to 1958. However, the State has limited the
maximum tax rate to fund such pre-1958 obligations to the rate levied in Fiscal Year 1982/1983; and
WHEREAS, the City of Rialto’s rate for the 1982/1983 Fiscal Year was $0.1506; and
WHEREAS, pursuant to City Council informal commitment to suspend its City Public
Employees Retirement System tax levy in the event that a Utility Users Tax was approved by voters
on June 3, 2003, the amount of City tax to fund such obligation of the City was suspended in 2003 by
reduction of the amount of such tax to $0 (zero), so long as another source of City funding for such
obligation could be identified,

NOW, THEREFORE, THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF RIALTO DOES
HEREBY FIND, DETERMINE, AND RESOLVE AS FOLLOWS:

Section 1:	The amount of money necessary to be raised by taxation on taxable property in

the City of Rialto as revenue to pay the City’s Public Employees Retirement System contribution for
the current Fiscal Year 2010/2011, provide for payment cash flow requirements, and pay the expense
of collecting said amount, is estimated to be $10,000,000.

Section 2:	The	City	Council	has	determined that in view of the drastic reductions in

historic State funding of cities, the City’s structural budget deficit and the current adverse economic
condition, it cannot assure that critical services, including even those for protection of the public safety
can be provided unless a source of funding this obligation to make the required PERS retirement
contribution can be assured.
