IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

The registered voters of the Hesperia Fire Protection District
(the "District") are being asked whether or not Ordinance No. HFPD-
1 of the District (the " Ordinance") shall be adopted. The
Ordinance is being submitted to the registered voters by the
District Board of Directors pursuant to the provisions of the Fire
Protection District Law of 1961 and California Government Code
Sections 50078 and following (combined, the "Law").

If enacted the Ordinance would authorize the levy of an annual
fire suppression assessment on all non-exempt parcels within the
District (the "Assessment"). The Assessment may be levied only for
10 years and solely for the purposes of obtaining, furnishing,
operating, and maintaining fire suppression equipment or apparatus,
paying the salaries and benefits of fire fighting personnel, or
paying indebtedness of the District incurred to acquire fire
station sites, or some combination thereof. The Assessment would be
be levied on such parcels whether or not fire suppression services
are actually used by or upon such parcel.

The Ordinance catagorizes parcels into three use catagories:
Vacant Parcels, Residential Dwelling Units and
Commercial/Industrial. Vacant Parcels include all parcels which are
not developed and include parcels used for agricultural, livestock
and similar uses. The annual Assessment for Vacant Parcels shall be
$8.00 per acre or portion thereof. Residential Dwelling Units
include attached and detached single family dwellings, duplexes,
condominiums, apartments, mobile homes and other dwelling units.
The annual Assessment for Residential Dwelling Units shall be
$2 3.00 per dwelling unit. Commercial/Industrial parcels include all
parcels used for commercial, office, industrial, manufacturing and
other related uses. The annual Assessment for Commercial/Industrial
parcels is based upon the size of the building or structure
assessed and the annual rate for a particular building or structure
may be determined by refering to Table 1 to the Ordinance.

The Assessment shall be collected in the same manner, and
subject to the same penalties as other fees, charges and taxes
fixed and collected by, or on behalf of, the District. It is
anticipated that the Assessment shall be collected on the property
tax bill for all parcels subject to the Assessment.

All Assessment revenues must be deposited into a seperate fund
of the District and may be expended within the District only for
the purposes described in the first paragraph of this analysis. At
the end of each fiscal year moneys remaining in this seperate fund
shall be carried over to be utilized for the same purposes in the
following fiscal year.

The Ordinance shall become valid and binding if a majority of
the votes cast are in favor of its adoption. The Ordinance may
subsequently be amended by a 2/3rds vote of the District Board of
Directors; provided, however, the Assessment rates may not be
increased and the duration of the levy may not be extended except
by a vote of the people of the District.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Ordinance
No. HFPD-1. If you desire a copy of the Ordinance, please
call the election official's office at 619-947-1027 and a
copy will be mailed at no cost to you.

Arguments in support of or in opposition to the proposed
laws are the opinions of the authors.

Argument in Favor of Measure

This assessment will improve fire protection service and help save
lives and property. Because existing Hesperia Fire Protection
District revenues are insufficient to allow for the purchase of
fire suppression equipment and the opening of Station #3. A four
member citizens assessment committee recommends an assessment of
$23 per house, per year, $8 per acre, per year for vacant
properties, and $100 per business, per year (on the average) for
ten years. This proposal will generate $682,398.96 during the
first year and approximately the same amount over the next nine
years. This proposed assessment is also three times lower than
that proposed last year and will not increase.

Specifically, the Hesperia Fire Protection District will replace
Engine 301 which is housed at 11th Avenue and Main Street, Engine
302 which is housed at Olive Street and I Avenue and staff, equip
and maintain Station #3 located on Lemon Street near I Avenue.
Staffing this; station will result in community-wide added
protection and decreased response times to fires and other
emergencies throughout Hesperia. This money cannot go into a
general fund. Moreover as it states in Section 4., of the
proposed Measure Ordinance, “All funds collected from the Fire
Suppression Assessment shall be deposited into a separate fund of
the District entitled the "Fire Suppression Assessment Fund," and
shall be expended within the Hesperia Fire Protection District
only for the purposes of obtaining, furnishing, operating and
maintaining fire suppression equipment and apparatus and for the
purpose of paying the salaries and benefits of fire fighting
personnel."

At the February 10,	1992	Board	meeting, a majority of citizens

spoke in favor of this assessment. This Assessment District asks a

“YES" vote.

Rebuttal Argument against Argument in Favor of Measure ____H

Regardless of the need, the special committee, a group ap-
pointed by the City Council, with the assistance of the Fire Chief,
developed and directed the Ordinance HFPD-1.

The majority of the citizens who spoke in favor of Ordinance
HFPD-1 at the council meeting on 2/10/92, were firefighters and
fellow fire association members. Also a key Fire Benefit Committee
member.

On 7/2/91. an assessment resolution similar to this, was turned
down by the Hesperia voters even though the imported City of Hesperia
Fire Department Administrative Analysts found in their study, and
stated, that the H.F.D. was on the verge of insolvency. But the
H.F.D. just continued operations, faithfully and punctually„

Were the imported Administrative Analysts trying to mislead the
voters in 1991 and now on 6/2/92 ? Was there mismanagment in 1991.
also now in 1992 ? Could it have been a so called computer virus
channeling H.F.D. tax monies into other than the H.F.D.s special
accounts in 1991 and now in 1992 ?

Regardless of whatever the cause is for the cry to the voters
for the necessity of the Ordinance HFPD-1 to be on the ballot, there
are many ways to accomplish the needs and goals of the H.F.D. with-
out having to place additional burdens on the Hesperia property
owners and taxpayers.	"VOTE	NO	!"

ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE H

This Fire Assessment was formulated by the City of Hesperia,
the Water Department and the Hesperia Fire Protection District. It's
a fact that all three are, for all intents and purposes, annexed as
one and the same. The Hesperia Fire District claims they are over-
worked because of the terrific growth since 1988. Well their co-part-
ners, the City Council caused this situation to develop due to their
ignoring the citizens of Hesperia's pleading for slow growth and their
repeated requests to the Planning Commission and the City Council
that they study more closely the requests of Land Developers for
acreage splitting and rezoning variances before approving the ortfi-
ances in favor of high density housing and single home tracts.

Just think a minutel Where is the big problem of new growth
and high density? It's south of Ranchero, it's Rancho Las Flores,
which is being developed along with Summit Valley, Oak Hills and
along the 1-15 corridor, in the City of Hesperia's sphere of in-
fluence. This is where the City, in it's entirety, includes the
City of Hesperia's Fire Protection Plan to use the assessment money
for stations, men and equipment, to be used as a magnet for new
ongoing development. Don't let this happen! Don't be misled!

If there has to be an assessment, this is where it should be'.

The developers and new homeowners should pay their way, they are
the problem.

Meanwhile, our fire and homeowners insurance rates have in-
creased, due to antiquated water lines and lack of functioning
fire hydrants.

Don't let this Fire Assessment be used as an open invitation
and reason for the City to initiate assessment after assessment in
the future, by our allowing this ordinance, #HFPD-l, to be passed.

Protect yourself now! Vote NO! *

William P. Laws Sr.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE H

The arguments against this assessment are wrong on several key
points. The proposed assessment was formulated by the Hesperia
Fire Protection Benefit Assessment Committee and the Fire
District. The Hesperia Fire Protection District is a subsidiary
district and cannot be annexed. The Fire District needs fire
engines, equipment; and needs to open stations on a full-time
basis to reduce response times, increase community-wide fire
protection and save lives and property. The population has grown
almost 300% in 10 years. The Fire Department still operates with
the same equipment. It is worn out and needs replaced.

The Fire District will purchase two (2) new front
replace Engine 301, housed at 11th Avenue and
Engine 302, housed at I Avenue and Olive Street,
money will be used to open Station #3, located
near I Avenue on a full-time basis. All of these
Hesperia.

line engines to
Main Street and
The assessment
on Lemon Street
locations are in

This assessment will increase the ability of the Hesperia Fire
Department to protect existing homes, business's and lives from

fire loss and will allow the Fire Department to get to your house
or place of business quicker in case of an emergency. If we do
not replace our equipment and open stations, the Fire Departments
response times will continue to get worse. This will increase the
likelihood of death or damage to lives and property.

Please vote YES on this assessment and begin these much needed
improvements.
