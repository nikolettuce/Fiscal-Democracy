REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE T

Some of the arguments made by opponents against this advisory measure are wrong.

More cops alone don’t prevent crime. Sacramento has 1.4 police officers per thousand j
residents. Washington, DC has 7 police officers per thousand residents - yet their crime
problem is worse than ours.	j

We need more police. But, more importantly, we need them to be partners with residents, |
neighborhoods, businesses, and schools. ^	j

We can’t promise that ail of the City’s efforts to reduce crime are going to be successful. This
plan simply offers to try some new ideas we think might work.

We can promise you the following:

Your $29 a year will be spent on crime reduction programs (like homework centers to keep
kids out of trouble, or a boot camp for non-violent troublemakers, with graffiti cleanup as
punishment).

50 to 80 more police for neighborhood work and crime prevention.

The program will end in 5 years.

We will report to you which programs work and which don't	!

Government can't do more for us than we can do for each other.	!

If you want us to try these new crime reduction ideas, then we need your help, as well as your !
vote.	j

The City wilt do its part. Last year, the City balanced its budget by trimming $26 million and
500 positions, starting at the top, by cutting 8 of 20 top managers.

We think this plan is fair, and makes sense. Vote YES on Measure T.

Sacramento is as good as we make it.
