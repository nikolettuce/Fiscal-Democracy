The facts are:

Due to declining state support and decreasing lottery funds, the Walnut Creek School
District has cut its budget significantly for each of the last three years.

The Walnut Creek School District has cut nearly three quarters of a million dollar? — over
7% — from its budget in one year alone.

These cuts have increased class sizes. They have removed many essential academic
programs from our schools and drastically reduced library programs.

The District cannot rely on st ate funds. The funds our schools need must be dependable,
and come from our local community.

Measure A is the only means by which the Walnut. Creek School District: can generate
local funds to restore programs and reduce increases in class size.

V,

Passage of Measure.' A will raise approximately $980,000 per year. These funds will be used:
to restore and maintain academic programs and services:
to restore library programs;
to reduce increases in class size;

to provide up-to-date textbooks and related materials, and

to restore services for students needing additional help in reading, math and English,

Measure A will raise these local fund* at the reasonable -	'	>	ear'-	;•	nee’	owner	of	$60	per

year. only $5 per month. Most homeowners own one	"his	.	>•:	vii;	not	increase and
