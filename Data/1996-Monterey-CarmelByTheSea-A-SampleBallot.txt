IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
CITY OF CARMEL-BY-THE-SEA
MEASURE A

The Carmel City Council passed and adopted Ordinance No. 96-
12 in November, 1996, revising the Business License tax and sup-
porting regulations. The overall impact of this action is to increase
Business License fees, which are general taxes, and because of
that, pursuant to California Constitution, Article X1IIC §(2)(c), the
matter must be ratified by a majority vote of the people at a gen-
eral election where City Councilmembers are elected. H

The Ordinance does not create a new tax, but it does increase
the amount of tax paid by some businesses, and does require
that some businesses that were previously exempt now pay this tax.
Although it is labeled a "business license", the Ordinance does not
regulate any business. It is basically a tax. on the privilege of
doing business within Carmel, and is similar to business license
in effect in most California cities.

While there are some exceptions, most businesses would have
to pay an initial application fee of $100 and an annual adminis-
trative fee of $50 to cover costs of issuing the Business License,
sin addition, a tax of eighty-eight cents ($.88) per thousand dollars
of gross revenue would also be collected annually. The business
categories of "special event" and "transportation of per-
sons/goods" would pay an annual fee not based on gross revenue
but on the number of events or trips per year. Definitions of what
constitutes "gross revenues" for different businesses is included
in the Ordinante.

Acting City Attorney

The above statement is the impartial analysis of Ordinance
No. 96-12 prepared by the Monterey City Attorney because the
Carmel City Attorney would be effected by the Ordinance. If
■ you desire a copy of the Ordinance, please call the City Clerk
at 624-2781, and a copy will be mailed at no cost to you.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE A

It has been more than 25 years since the Business License Tax
has been revised. A consultant, hired by the City to review the
current structure of the Business License Tax, found that the pre-
sent tax rate structure has many inequities in it, with some busi-
nesses paying only a nominal flat fee, others no fee, while many
businesses pay a fee based On gross receipts. Those businesses
whose license fee is based on gross receipts experience in-
creases in their taxes each year based on inflation and increased
prices of goods. Those who pay a flat fee have not had an in-
crease in their Business License Tax for more than 25 years.

The Business District Advisory Committee (BDAC) felt that it
would be more equitable to have a single tax rate based on gross
receipts. The BDAC recommended a revenue target of $400,000,
to allow for a margin of error in collections during the first year
until the new tax rate Structure has leveled out.

This results in a uniform business license tax rate of $0.88 per
,$1000 Of gross income. Thus, a business with gross sales of
$100,000 would pay $88 a year for its business license, while a
business with gross sales of $1,000,000 would pay $880. This
represents a significant reduction for businesses such as food
stores, restaurants and other retail businesses, which have been
paying an unduly large share Of the Business License Tax. Resi-
dential and commercial rentals, services and professions, cur-
rently based on flat fees, will have an increase.

THIS CHANGE WILL HAVE NO IMPACT ON RESIDENTS. BUSI-
NESSES, NOT RESIDENTS, PAY THE BUSINESS LICENSE TAX.

We urge the voters of Carmel to approve the proposed revision
to the Business License Tax ordinance.
