CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF
MEASURE A

Through Measure A, the Council seeks to renovate the Swim Center and designated park
clubhouses and establish a dedicated fund for the maintenance and replacement of city capital
facilities. If approved by two-thirds of the voters, the Swim Center arid clubhouse renovations will be
accomplished through a special tax in the maximum, yearly amount of $58.46 on single-family homes
and comparable amounts on muttifamily and nemresidential property. The dedicated Maintenance and
Capitol facilities Fund will be financed through annual contributions from the City general fund and
may only be used for the maintenance and replacement of city capital facilities.

The Swim Center was constructed 37 years ago. It no longer complies with health and safety
standards. Its components, including the locker room, pool decks and pump room, are deteriorating.
A community process was initiated to develop a master plan for the Swim' Center. It includes an
enlarged swimming pool, a new swim center building, new locker rooms and other improvements. The
master plan has been approved by the Park and Recreation Commission, the Committee of lhe Whole
and the City Council.

Canyon Trail Clubhouse was constructed in the 1960's. It was. dosed because of seismic safety
concerns. Once renovated, Canyon Trail Clubhouse will be utilized as an arts center providing classes
in such areas as drawing, ceramics and photography. It also will be used for recreational and

educational programs.

Restrooms at Harding, Huber and Poinsett parks were closed because they did not. meet certain
legal requirements. They will be rehabilitated so that park patrons again have restrooms at their

disposal.

These renovations cost $5.31. million. To provide these funds. Measure A imposes a special
annual tax m the maximum amount of $58.46 for single-family homes, $45.00 for muitifamily units
and $410 per acre on nonresidential property. Tax payments will continue for up to 20 years and will
be collected with the property tax. Low income senior citizens, blind or disabled persons may be
entitled to financial assistance in paying the tax.

Tax proceeds may be used only for the renovation programs identified above. The tax may not
be increased without a vote. A grant and contribution program will be implemented. Monies received
in grants and contributions shall be used to reduce the tax amount or the term of the tax. A dedicated
fund will be established for maintenance and reconstruction of the Swim Center and clubhouses.

In addition, the City shall establish a dedicated Maintenance and Capital Replacement Fund.
This fund will be financed by yearly contributions from the general fund, indexed by the amount net
revenues from the real property transfer tax exceed the sum of $250,000. Monies in the fund may
come from sales tax, property tax, or any other available funds. Fund proceeds shall be devoted
exclusively to the maintenance and replacement of City capital facilities. Monies in the fund may not
be used for any other purpose without a vote of the people.

ordinance, please call the election official’s office at telephone nnmber 510-215-4300 and a copy

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF

CITY OF EL CERRITO
MEASURE A

The El Cerrito community is coming together to' finally address longstanding infrastructure needs by
putting Measure A on the ballot by a unanimous vote of the City Council. Its passage will affirm that

we are a city moving forward together and not a city in decline.

For the first time in recent years every major political group in the city has reached consensus and
enthusiastically supports Measure A, Why?

Because Measure A will:

•	create a designated infrastructure fund out of existing revenue to be used primarily for
road repair, seismic upgrades, and preparing for fires and disasters. This fund will not
require you to pay any additional taxes.

•	set a fixed rate of a maximum of approximately $58 a year per house for immediate
infrastructure and recreational needs and will sunset after 20 years, but the facilities il
funds will be around far longer.

•	renovate a deteriorating swim center that will serve our community for 40 years.

•	restore park clubhouses and give seniors, scouts, people with disabilities, children and
adults wonderful places to gather and learn. These clubhouses have been closed for
years due to seismic and safety hazards.

The Alliance has opposed a number of previously proposed taxes that we felt were not in the interest
of the taxpayers. We ENTHUSIASTICALLY SUPPORT this measure because in addition to attending
to the immediate problems of the Pool and parks, section 10 of this bond issue mandates that the city
spend significant sums on other infrastructure needs (streets, buildings etc .) without additional taxes.
This 20 year mandate can only be modified by the voters, not by any Council, thereby ensuring that
the long neglected needs of the city will be addressed.

REBUTTAL T< GUMENT IN FAVOR OF

CITY OF EL CERRITO
MEASURE A

There are a few things that the pool promoter*, haven’t told you, and we think you should
know:

*	El Cerrito’s budget, growing at 3/4 Million a year, has a 2 1/2 Million Reserve Fund,
TWICE that recommended by a citizen’s committee,

*	The City does not need a bond measure to flexibly set aside money for infrastructure repair.
Most cities already do so.

*	Although continuing prosperity cannot be predicted, prudent money management can keep
our expenditures in line with revenues for the future.

*	The bond enthusiasts will tell you that this measure “will not require you to pay any
additional taxes.” However, Mayor Brusatori in her November 12, 1999 Journal article, while
promising us that the City “will raise at least $500,000 or about 10% ofthe cost of the Swim Center

through grants, contributions and fund raising,”--informs us: “This would save interest costs

and demonstrate good faith to the voters who will be asked to support tax measures to finance
capital improvements in the future.”

*	This measure serves the wishes of the few, while ignoring the needs of the majority: our
senior citizens.

*	Lastly, there is no provision requiring a buy-down nor for that matter can the pool
promoters explain the 61% total of “contingency fees.” Isn't this a very high price to pay for
uncertainty?

Shouldn’t the voter know the real price tag before being asked to purchase this White Elephant?

ARGUMENT AGAINST
CITY OF EL CERRITO

MEASURE A

El Cerrito residents face an estimated 35 Million for streets, roads, public building repairs.

Since the 1980's, El Cerrito has allocated less than 2% annually for this purpose. Although
the current budget is over IS Million, the inbalance between funding for services and infrastructure
needs has raised the price tag sharply higher with each passing year.

However, rather than look at our needs as a whole, obtain realistic estimates, priorities, the
Council has placed, despite widely varying estimates, a bond measure before you for 4.9 Million for
Swim Center, and a modest park rehabilitation for approximately $350,000.

We urge you to reject this hastily and poorly conceived measure because:

*	The Council has yet to explore alternate, more viable, creative solutions.

*	indexing future maintenance to the Transfer Tax in itself “volatile and hard to predict year 4

4

to year," that has been successfully challenged in court as unconstitutional, and in danger of
disappearing, would cause serious problems. Projecting a continuous boom-time scenario of $700,000
from the Transfer Tax is unrealistic It would still require a series of additional bond measures.

*	The Swim Center is used by less than 7% of El Cerrito residents - - - the rest coming from
neighborhood communities.

*	The 20 year parcel tax is the more expensive way to finance the renovation of an
outdoor pool.

*	Although the Council rejected an Indoor Therapeutic pool, most appropriate in our cool
climate and of particular benefit to our aging and disabled populations, seniors still bear the brunt of
this new.' 20 year / $1200 tax. The means tested, bureaucratic "exemptions” would make it extremely
difficult for seniors to opt out. Yet there are exemptions for absentee landholders and the Mira Vista
Country Ciub. No means testing here!

We need a better, more equitabie solution.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST
CITY OF EL CERRITO

MEASURE A

The "Argument Against" Measure A contains false and misleading statements.

Measure A was carefully structured after all alternatives were fully explored and after estimated costs
were thoroughly reviewed. There is nothing “hasty” or “poorly conceived” about it.

While it is true that we must now rebuild the decayed infrastructure caused by State takeaways, IT IS
NOT TRUE that this will cost $35 million or that the City allocates only 2% of its budget to
infrastructure.

In fad, Measure A imposes more rigorous accountability on such allocations and specifically requires
that taxes formerly put into the general fund must now be dedicated to infrastructure. Streets are a TOP
priority. However, while street repair costs can be spread over time, rebuilding facilities requires lump-
sum up-front funding.

The Swim Center is effectively marketed to non-residents who pay substantially higher fees to reduce
operating costs. However, the value of the swim center extends far beyond the number of swimmers.
Its presence maintains property values and increases the appeal of this community to future residents.

A therapeutic pool remains part of the final cost/benefit considerations. If Measure A is defeated,
however, a therapeutic pool along with this valuable City asset will be eliminated entirely. The Swim
Center will close.

Measure A falls evenly on all property owners, allows special dispensations for seniors, the Mind and
disabled. It does NOT contain any "special exemptions for absentee landholders

Measure A is a win-win proposition for everyone in this City.

VOTE “YES’* FOR A BETTER EL CERRITO.
