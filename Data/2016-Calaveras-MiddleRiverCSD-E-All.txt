Special Tax — Measure E

"Shall the parcel tax for parcels within the Middle River Community Services District increase from $100.00 to
$200.00 per year for developed parcels and from $75.00 to $100.00 per year for undeveloped parcels?"

A “YES” vote on this Measure would grant the Middle River Community Services District (“District”) legal authority
to levy an annual special tax of $200.00 per parcel for developed parcels, and an annual special tax of $100.00
per undeveloped parcel — all such parcels to be within the District’s boundaries. Approval of this Measure would
authorize the District to secure these additional tax revenues to be applied only for purposes described in the
Measure, which is authorized by Government Code sections 61121 and 50075 et seq. Approval of the Measure
would require compliance with other accountability measures under Government Code section 50075.1 et seq.,
including establishment of a special account into which the revenues of the special tax shall be deposited, and.
filing of an annual report by the Chief Fiscal Officer of the District with the District Board of Directors regarding
collection and expenditure of the special tax revenues.

A “NO” vote on this Measure is a vote against the levy of the special tax.

Measure E has been placed on the ballot by the governing body of the district, and must be approved by two-
thirds (2/3) of the voters of the Middle River Community Services District
effective.
