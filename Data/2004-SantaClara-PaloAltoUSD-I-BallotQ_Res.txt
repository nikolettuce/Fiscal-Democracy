PALO ALTO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT	Date:	02.08.05

TO:	Board of Education

FROM:	Gerald F. Matranga, Associate Superintendent

SUBJECT:	Parcel Tax Election Resolution #2004-05.13

BACKGROUND

At the meetings of January 11,2005, and January 25,2005, the Board of Education considered
placing another parcel tax request before the voters.

Proposed Resolution for a June Parcel Tax

Staff has worked with Larry Tramutola to prepare a formal resolution and ballot language
(Attachment AA) for a new parcel tax. The resolution and ballot language take into consideration
the desire of the Board of Education to make the language more positive, set the parcel tax at $493
per year per parcel for six years, incorporate an optional senior exemption, and have an
independent oversight committee and annual audits. The ballot language states:

“To preserve small class sizes; maintain educational programs that enhance
student achievement; and restore some essential educational programs—
including elementary literacy, math, and art support, and middle and high school
class offerings—shall the Palo Alto Unified School District replace its current
parcel tax with a $493 yearly assessment for six years with an optional exemption
for senior citizens and an independent oversight committee?”

Summary

As background, the agenda items from the meetings of January 11,2005, and January 25,2005,
are attached to this enclosure.

Recommendation

It is recommended that, after the Public Hearing at this meeting, the Board of Education approve
the amount and duration of a PAUSD parcel tax. It is also recommended that the Board approve
the following revised Resolution #2004-05.13 and the ballot language for a parcel tax measure that
could be placed on the June 2005 ballot.

PALO ALTO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT

Palo Alto Unified School District Quality Public Education Preservation Act of 2005
INTRODUCTION

To maintain exceptional public education in our neighborhood schools, avoid deeper cuts to
classroom instruction, preserve smaller class sizes, keep educational programs that attract the
best teachers and school employees and enhance student achievement in order to maximize
learning by our community’s children, shall the Palo Alto Unified School District be authorized
to levy a qualified special tax in an amount not to exceed $493 per year for 6 years beginning as
of July 1, 2005, assessed against each parcel of taxable land in the District, with an optional
exemption annually available, upon application, for senior citizens? Said qualified special tax
would replace the qualified special tax approved by the voters of the District on June 5, 2001.

PURPOSE

To provide local revenue that cannot be taken by the State and to maintain exceptional public
education in our neighborhood schools, the Palo Alto Unified School District proposes to levy a
qualified special tax for a period of 6 years, beginning July 1, 2005, at the rate of $493 per year
on each assessor’s parcel located within the School District, with an optional exemption annually
available, upon application, for senior citizens, and to implement accountability measures in
connection with the special tax to provide oversight and accountability to ensure that funds are
used to:

•	Restore some of the programs and replace some of the funds lost or reduced due to
budget cuts;

•	Sustain achievement in reading, writing, and mathematics for all students at all grade
levels by preserving smaller class sizes, while maintaining the ability to attract and retain
quality teachers;

•	Maintain essential academic programs, including science, reading, math, music, and art;

•	Protect the taxpayers’ investment in education and ensure District accountability by
providing for oversight and independent financial audits of revenues and expenditures.

The Board of Education will fund all of the programs listed above, unless the Board of Education
determines in any given year that changes in student population, fiscal constraints, or other
changes in state or federal funding make doing so infeasible or inadvisable. In any event, the

A-l

ATTACHMENT AA

Board of Education will not fund any program or reduction other than those listed above from
the proceeds of the special taxes.

OPTIONAL SENIOR CITIZEN EXEMPTION AVAILABLE

An optional exemption from the special tax will be made available annually to each individual in
the District who will attain 65 years of age prior to July 1 of the tax year, and who owns a
beneficial interest in the parcel, and who uses that parcel as his or her principal place of
residence, and who applies to the School District on or before July 1, 2005, or July 1 of any
succeeding tax year. Any application for such exemption must be renewed annually.

ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES

In accordance with the requirements of California Government Code sections 50075.1 and
50075.3, the following accountability measures, among others, shall apply to the special taxes
levied in accordance with this Measure: (a) the specific purposes of the special tax shall be those
purposes identified above; (b) the proceeds of the special tax shall be applied only to those
specific purposes identified above; (c) a separate, special account shall be created into which the
proceeds of the special taxes must be deposited; and (d) an annual written report shall be made to
the Board of Education of the District showing (i) the amount of funds collected and expended
from the proceeds of the special taxes and (ii) the status of any projects or programs required or
authorized to be funded from the proceeds of the special taxes, as identified above.

In addition to the accountability measures required by State law, an independent Community
Oversight Committee shall be appointed by the Board of Education to advise the Board on the
expenditures funded by the measure in order to ensure that said funds are spent for the purposes
approved by the voters. The Community Oversight Committee will monitor the expenditures of
these funds by the District and will report on an annual basis to the Board and community on
how these funds have been spent.

PROTECTION OF FUNDING

Current law forbids any decrease in State or Federal funding to the District because of the
District’s adoption of a parcel tax. However, if any such funds are reduced because of the
adoption of this parcel tax, then the amount of the special taxes will be reduced annually as
necessary in order to restore such State or Federal funding.

PALO ALTO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT	Date:	01.25.05

TO:	Board of Education

FROM:	Mary Frances Callan,	Superintendent

Gerald F. Matranga, Associate Superintendent

SUBJECT:	Parcel Tax

Background

On January 11, the Board discussed whether or not to place another parcel tax request before the
voters. This two hour discussion was based on information contained in the staff report, a
summary of a poll conducted by Gene Bregman & Associates, comments from the District's
consultant, Larry Tramutola, and input from the community. A copy of the January 11 Staff Report
(Attachment 1) and a copy of the poll results (Attachment 2) are attached to this report.

Based on the discussion, the Board expressed interest in placing another parcel tax measure on
the June 2005 ballot. This interest was based on several factors. In order to retain the $5.5 million
generated from the District's current parcel tax, voter approval must be obtained before
November 2005, or the District will need to reduce this amount from its budget. In addition, the
Board discussed the current financial situation that has required over $6.5 million in reductions and
the use of over $3.4 million in reserves over the past 24 months. This financial situation has been
caused by: lowered State revenues to the District, increasing enrollment, increasing health and
welfare costs, and declining property tax growth. The Board also noted that 66.03 percent of voters
(over 22,000 yes votes) supported the November 2004 Measure I Parcel Tax. This indicates broad
community support for the local schools and educational programs.

In preparation for this discussion, the Board requested staff to do the following.

1.	Provide an update of the District's estimated Property Tax growth for the 2004-05 fiscal
year; how any estimated growth will assist the District in addressing its projected structural
deficit; and proposed additional costs being transferred to the District from the State.

2.	Provide two options for a new parcel tax. One option would be for $493. The first option
would explain how the amount was derived and what it could provide to preserve and
restore the District's nationally recognized educational programs. The second option would
be for a lower amount of $465. Staff would illustrate what this lower amount would be able
to do.

3.	Provide information from Gene Bregman on the effect on voter approval of lowered parcel
tax amounts.

4.	Provide a resolution for a June parcel tax with the needed supporting documents.

5.	Provide a list of the additional reductions that the District would need to make if a parcel tax
measure was not successfully passed by November 2005.

The remainder of this report addresses these requests.

Update on District's Estimated Property Tax Growth for 2004-05

As noted in the January 11 staff report, the District has had uncertain and reduced property tax
growth over the past two years. As a basic aid district, the actual property tax growth is not known
until after the fiscal year in which it is spent. In the 2003-04 fiscal year, property tax growth that
had been projected at 3.77 percent in July 2003 ended up being .92 percent in June 2004. As a
result of this and the ensuing reductions that had to be made, the District projected 1.0 percent
property tax growth for the 2004-05 fiscal year. At the District’s first quarterly meeting with the
County in August, the estimate was projected to be 6.1 percent. This was due to the sale of the
Stanford Shopping Center and some revenue from the building of the Hyatt Classic Residences.

(It should be noted that the Hyatt Classic Residences are leaseholds and not fee ownership units.
This means that the District will not see large property tax increases as these units are occupied.)

At our second quarterly meeting with the County in November 2004, the estimated tax growth was
reduced to 5.84 percent due to continued downward reassessments of businesses and losses in
the unsecured roll. It was also noted at this meeting that a large reassessment request being
made by a local corporation might be granted in May 2005. As a result, the District left its
projected property tax growth at 1.0 percent for the First Interim Report.

The next quarterly meeting of basic aid districts with the County will be held in mid-February.
However, staff did call the County and requested an update. The County asked that the request be
made in writing so that staff would be able to better respond to the questions. A copy of that
request is attached (Attachment 3). While staff did not receive a reply from the County in time for it
to be included in this report, an update will be provided during the meeting.

Staff is also discussing increasing the projected Property Tax Growth for the Second Interim
Report from 1.0 percent to 2.0 percent for fiscal year 2004-05. This would be in keeping with the
projections used by the District prior to 2002-03. This increase would erase the District's current
structural deficit, but would still leave the District with a possible deficit from the State. The extent
of this deficit will not be known until the adoption of the State budget. If the Governor's proposal is
accepted, the deficit could be as high as an additional $1,000,000. Erasing the current structural
deficit also does not leave any additional dollars in the General Fund to address growing
enrollment, increasing employee costs, or restoration of any educational programs that were
reduced.

At best, the above information indicates the District may be able to address its current structural
deficit, but continues to face uncertain financial issues.

Options for a Parcel Tax

In 2001, the voters approved a $293 parcel tax that generates $5.5 million per year for the District.
The funds from that parcel tax were to be used to attract and retain qualified employees by
increasing salaries in 2001, to reduce class size in targeted grades, and to maintain programs.

The money was allotted for those purposes. The District also added further funding to reduce
class size in Grades 4 and 5 to 20 to 1. A summary of the report that discloses expenditures from
parcel tax proceeds in included in Attachment 1.

Since the passage of that parcel tax, the District has reduced its budget by $6.5 million and used
$3.4 million in reserves. If the District wanted to restore the $6.5 million in reductions and renew
the $5.5 million parcel tax, a total of $12 million dollars per year would be needed. This amounts to
$631 per parcel.

Due to the current financial situation faced at the local, state, and national levels, the Board
realized it would not be reflecting community needs if it requested full restoration of the $6.5 million
reductions along with the renewal of the $5.5 million. Therefore, the Board placed a $521 parcel
tax request on the November 2004 ballot. Measure I would have maintained the current parcel tax

amount and added $228 per year for a total of $9.8 million per year. As noted previously, it was narrowly defeated. Table 1 illustrates how the $9.8 million could have been used.  TABLE 1 $521 Parcel Tax - $9.8 Million Potential Distribution of Proceeds

	TOTALS	31.6	$9,771,693

In developing an amount for a new parcel tax measure, one must keep in mind the educational
needs that exist as well as the financial concerns of the local citizens. Each of the following
options would bring differing amounts into the District to address the educational needs that exist.

In developing these options, the actual cost to the District of class size reduction was reviewed.
K-12 class size reduction costs the District $7.2 million. With the State’s contribution of $3.2 million
and the parcel tax contribution of $1.4 million, the District’s General Fund contributes $2.6 million
(see Attachment 4).

Option 1 - $493 Parcel Tax

A new parcel tax for $493 would generate $9.3 million in ongoing revenue for the District for a set
number of years. Of this $9.3 million, $5.5 million would allow the District to continue the current
parcel tax expenditures. These current expenditures include $1.4 million for class size reduction in
Grades 4-8 and 10. In addition, the cost of the class size reduction brought about by the current
parcel tax costs the District an additional $1.4 million from the General Fund (Attachment 5).

A new parcel tax needs to produce at least $6.9 million to maintain the integrity of the class size
reduction in Grades 4-8 and 10. This would leave $2.5 million for some restorations to instructional
programs and academic support that have been reduced over the past two years. Based on
discussions with principals, many of whom also met with staff and parents, $2.5 million would only
allow for a minimum amount of restoration.

Table 2 illustrates how the $9.3 million could be spent to maintain class size reduction in Grades
4-8 and 10 and to restore some reductions.

These restorations to instructional programs and academic support do not take into account
enrollment growth. However, they do allow the school sites the ability to provide some student
offerings that were reduced or eliminated. Attachment 6 describes the impact of budget reductions
on high schools. The restorations also allow for more site communication with the parents and the
ability to address student concerns more quickly.

It was for these reasons that the $493 per parcel amount was proposed.

Option 2 - $465 Parcel Tax

Should the Board prefer to request a smaller amount for the new parcel tax measure, it was
recommended by Gene Bregman that the Board consider a $465 parcel tax. This amount
generates $8.8 million per year. As $6.9 million is needed to cover the current parcel tax and the
cost of class size reduction as noted in Option 1 above, $500,000 would need to be reduced from
Option 1. This translates to fewer instructional offerings and less academic support. Table 3
illustrates how these reductions could be made to maintain as much direct support as possible.

The above options provide the Board information on how the proposed $493 was derived as well
as how a reduced parcel tax amount could be used to assist with restoring some of the District's
instructional programs and academic support.

The instructional needs of the students have suffered with the $6.5 million in reductions. There are
fewer class offerings, larger class sizes at the secondary schools, fewer student support services,
and fewer staff to work with parents on the questions and concerns they have. The options above
do not restore, by any means, the reductions and support students and parents had two years ago.
This is compounded by enrollment growth. The above options, however, do maintain current class
size reductions and restore some essential services. Further reducing the above options does not
appear to generate significantly larger voter approval.

Effect of Lowered Tax Amounts on Voter Approval

At the request of the Board, Gene Bregman provided a January 12,2005, memo regarding the
effect of lowered parcel tax amounts on voter approval. That memo is Attachment 7. In reviewing
this memo and discussing it with Gene Bregman, it appears that the Board would need to seek a
parcel tax reduction below $450 per parcel to have a significant impact on increased voter
approval. There will always be a core of voter opposition in the community regardless of the
amount of the tax.

Larry Tramutola will be present to discuss this issue further and address any questions the Board
may have.

Proposed Resolution for a June Parcel Tax

Staff has worked with Larry Tramutola to prepare ballot language for a new parcel tax. Following is
sample language.

To avoid deeper cuts to classroom instruction, maintain manageable class sizes,
restore essential educational programs including teachers, counselors, school
support staff, instructional materials, and academic support, shall the Palo Alto

Unified School District replace its current parcel tax with a $_yearly

assessment for___years, including an exemption for senior citizens.

Attachment 8 includes a draft resolution and accompanying documents. Based on the Board's
discussion, the amount and the length can be inserted into the language. Larry Tramutola will be
present to discuss the language. This language reflects the above options being proposed for the
parcel tax. Following this discussion, corrections can be made and a resolution and accompanying
legal language prepared for the next Board meeting on February 8. There will also be a public
hearing at that meeting.

Additional Reductions if a Parcel Tax is not Passed

The 2001 parcel tax expires June 2006. If it is not renewed by November 2005, the District will
need to begin the process for reducing $5.5 million. These reductions in funding will result in the
further loss of programs for students. The $6.5 million in reductions already made were kept as far
from the classroom as possible. If forced to reduce another $5.5 million, programs that directly
affect many of our students will need to be reduced or eliminated.

The District would need to consider eliminating all class size reduction. In addition, another
$1.5 million in reductions would be needed. Below is a chart listing some programs that could be
considered. The cost of these programs is based on the cost of the staff providing them. These
reductions would be effective for the 2006-07 school year.

Examples of Potential Reductions if a $5.5 million parcel tax is not renewed by November 2005

K-12 class size reduction net savings	$2,500,000*

Middle School 7 period day	$1,120,000

Reductions in academic support and pupil services	$	670,000

High School 7 period day	$	630,000

Closing of one elementary school due to termination of class size reduction $ 580,000
*ln reducing K-12 class size reduction, 82 teachers would be released. The District
would also lose the state contribution. Therefore, the net savings is approximately
$2.5 million.

These are only examples. Due to the severity of these reductions, a community process would
need to be used to determine the final reductions.

Summary

The above report and attachments provide information to the Board in response to the requests
made at the January 11 Board Meeting. Staff and Larry Tramutola will address questions the
Board may have in the course of its discussion. Following this discussion, at the direction of the
Board, staff will prepare the necessary documentation for February 8 to place a parcel tax on the
June ballot.

Recommendation

It is recommended that the Board discuss this report and provide direction to staff on the amount,
length, and the resolution language for a parcel tax measure that could be placed on the June
2005 ballot.

PALO ALTO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT	Date:	01.11.05

TO:	Board of Education

FROM:	Mary Frances Callan, Ph.D.,	Superintendent

SUBJECT:	Parcel Tax

Background

In June 2001, the voters in Palo Alto overwhelmingly passed a $293 parcel tax for the Pal Alto
Unified School District. This tax was to be used to reduce class size, maintain programs, and
provide a raise to staff inorder to recruit and retain quality teachers. It netted the District
$5.5 million in ongoing funds, allowed the District to add Grades 4 and 5 to the class size reduction
program at 24 to 1, and to reduce class sizes in the middle and high schools in selected areas
including math and language arts. (Due to property tax growth at the time, the District was able to
further reduce Grades 4 and 5 class size to 20 to 1.) The tax was passed for five years and is now
up for renewal.

In the years following the passage of this tax, the District has seen a decline in revenue from the
State, a decline in property tax growth, and growth in student enrollment. As a result, since
January 2003 and continuing through the 2004-05 school year, the District has reduced its budget
$6.5 million, using $3.4 million in reserves. The lists of reductions that have been made are
attached to this report.

Student Growth, Lowered State Revenues, and Increased Costs

In the past three years, the District has grown by 600 students. As a Basic Aid District, no revenue
is received from the State for these additional students. In fact, the $120 per student the District
previously received was eliminated in the State budget reductions. This has meant an on-going
loss of over $1.2 million in revenue per year. The District has also faced increasing health and
welfare costs for its employees. This is in spite of the reductions and additional out of pocket
expenses that staff have chosen in order to maintain coverage.

Declining Growth in Property Taxes

Decreasing Property Tax growth compounded the growth of students and the reduction of over
$1.2 million in revenue from the State. In the 2003-04 school year, property tax growth that was
originally estimated to be 3.77 percent ended up in July 2004 to be 0.92 percent. As with all Basic
Aid Districts, the exact amount of revenue from property tax is not known until the end of the fiscal
year in which it is being spent. This requires the District to be conservative in its estimates of
revenues coming from property tax growth.

Uncertain Growth of Property Tax

Because of the decreasing nature of the property tax growth, the District projected 1 percent
growth for the current school year, 2004-2005. The exact amount of that growth will not be known
until July 2005. However, due to the sale of the Stanford Shopping Center, the District was
informed in August that the estimated tax may rise by 5.1 percent. That estimate was reduced to
4.84 percent in November and may go lower due to the loss of value in the unsecured roll and the
number of businesses that are requesting decreases in their assessed valuations. Some of the
revenue from Hyatt Classic Residences was also factored into this increase. As they are
leaseholds rather than fee ownership, we do not expect ongoing increases when they change
hands. The best that can be said is that it appears the growth in property tax may have stabilized
and may not go down as much as it has the previous two years.

This additional growth in property tax has allowed the district to address a $1.2 million deficit that
remained in the budget despite the $6.5 million in reductions and to cover the increased cost of the
reduced health and welfare benefits. However, there is no additional funding available to address
the $6.5 million in reductions to programs and the growth in enrollment. Further, there may be a
small continuing structural deficit in the budget if property tax growth for 2005 and beyond does not
increase by more than 1 percent.

Request for Local Property Tax to Ensure Quality Education

Given lowered revenues and increasing student enrollment, the Board placed the renewal of the
current property tax on the November 2004 ballot along with the addition of another parcel tax.
Measure I would have continued the $5.5 million from 2001 and added another $4.3 million to
begin to address a continuing deficit, maintained current program, and considered restoration of
some essential programs. The Measure was narrowly defeated by less than 1 percent of the vote.
It needed 66.67 percent to pass and received 66.03 percent. Even in defeat, it received 22,000
yes votes, more than any the District has ever received in all of its successful campaigns.

The need for the renewal of the current parcel tax remains, as does the need for additional
revenues to maintain current programs and to make some restorations in order to ensure the
ongoing quality of program. In fact, a local parcel tax is one of the only ways the community has to
ensure its priority for small class sizes is met. The State cannot capture locally voted parcel tax
funds, and these funds are independent of property tax growth.

In order to determine how another local property tax request should be made, a number of issues
need to be addressed. These issues include the total amount to be addressed in a parcel tax
request, the length of the parcel tax, the date for a parcel tax election, and the consequences to the
District should the 2001 parcel tax not be renewed. These issues are addressed below.

Parcel Tax Amounts

As noted above, the current parcel tax brings $5.5 million a year into the District. This amount, in
conjunction with the amount received from the State to assist with K-3 class size reduction, allows
the District to maintain smaller class sizes. Should this parcel tax not be renewed, the District
would have to make at least an additional $5.5 million in reductions above the $6.5 million it has

already made. Further, the District may face an ongoing structural deficit of $600,000 for future
years even with property tax growth estimated for the 2004-2005 school year. This deficit does not
address increasing health and welfare costs, restoration of any programs made by the reduction of
the $6.5 million, or increasing demands caused by enrollment growth. Even if an assumption is
made that property tax growth will increase by 2 percent, which was the percent used prior to the
2002-03 school year to project growth, only the on-going structural deficit is erased. The other
pressures on the budget remain.

It should also be noted that each year the parcel tax has been in place, the cost for class size
reduction has grown as the district grows in enrollment and other employee and fixed costs rise.
Staffing costs for class size reduction alone now total almost $1.3 million over the $5.5 million
parcel tax and that is without any employee raises for the past two years. (See attached annual
parcel tax report.) Should the $5.5 million parcel tax not be renewed, the district would need to
reduce $6.8 million in March 2006 in order to accommodate the loss of the parcel tax and to
address the encroachment on the General Fund of $1.3 million for class size reduction. This
reduction translates into the loss of 79.62 FTE employees. It would mean the loss of all class size
reduction programs K-12. This also assumes that property tax growth for the 2005-06 school year
and beyond will be at least 2 percent and that there will be no structural deficit.

In order to maintain current class size reduction programs K-12 and restore some essential
programs for which this District is noted and for which it attracts residents, additional dollars over
and above the current $5.5 million are needed. This amount could be as high as the Measure I
request, an additional $228 per parcel that would have yielded $9.8 million in revenue per year for
the District. Flowever, given the defeat of the measure, even by a narrow margin, it would be
prudent to reduce this amount. If a reduction were made to an additional $200 per year per parcel,
the District would receive an additional $3.8 million per year over the $5.5 million for a total of
$9.3 million. This amount is based on the retention of the senior exemption. It would bring the
total parcel tax from $521 per year as proposed in Measure I, down to $493.

This new parcel tax, generating $9.3 million per year in revenue would allow the District to maintain
manageable class sizes, restore counseling ratios and some staffing and support services needed
at the school sites, as well as restore some funding for instructional materials and academic
support at each school.

Currently data is being gathered from the community through a poll to better understand how to
structure a new parcel tax request. Information from this poll will be available at the meeting. Larry
Tramutola who is working with the District will be present at the meeting to address questions.

Length of Parcel Tax

Measure I requested the renewal of the current parcel tax along with an addition that would be
collected for 8 years. Again, while there was little criticism of the length of the request, it would be
prudent to shorten it. A 5-year parcel tax means that the renewal process needs to begin 12 to 18
months in advance to meet the dates for notices that must be given to staff should the renewal not
be successful and to meet the deadlines for special elections. A 6- or 7-year parcel tax would
allow the District to wait at least four and a half years between elections. It would also allow the
community time to see the value of the programs being funded.

Timing of Election

It is important to note that the regular election times left to the District before it has to make
$6.8 million in reductions are June and November 2005. The cost of a regular election is $7 to $9
per voter or $377,762 to $485,694 depending on the number of items on the ballot. A June 2005
election would ensure that the funds needed for the 2005-2006 school year would be available in
July 2005. In order to meet the deadline for the June ballot, the Board must have passed a
resolution and filed all necessary paperwork by early March. That would mean staff would need to
bring a resolution to hold a parcel tax election to the Board for its discussion at its January 25
meeting. This resolution could then be voted on at the February 8 Board Meeting.

Recommendation

It is recommended that the Board review and discuss the issues presented in this narrative and
provide direction to the staff regarding the renewal of the current parcel tax and addition of a new
parcel tax amount. That direction should include the amount and duration of the parcel tax along
with the date of the election.

Here, the assumption is that two days will be deleted. If all three days are deleted, the savings will be proportionately greater. The loss of income for 2 days of $323,000 and the savings in compensation of $572,000 yield a net savings of $249,000. This reduction was not made.				$249,000

58		The state has reduced the transfer to Routine Maintenance from 3% of the General Fund to 3% of the smaller Unrestricted General Fund. This calculation has cut the General Fund obligation by $700,000. At this point, it is intended that the General Fund will contribute an additional $290,000.

General Opinions About New Parcel Tax Measure

5% No opinion

23% It doesn't really matter whether the tax
is $493 or $521,1 would not support this
tax Increase

25% Because the needs of the children
have not decreased and our schools are not
getting any more money now than two
months ago, the District really should ask
voters to approve the same $521 tax that
was on the ballot in November

47% Since the District was not able to
obtain the required two-thirds vote last
Nov ember for the $521 tax, it is only prudent
for the District to ask voters to approve the
lower amount of $493 if that will be sufficient
to maintain most educational programs

Comparisons Of “Much More Likely” Proportions:
Aprif 2004 vs. January 2005

E. Without this parcel tax we may have to lay off many of our

outstandng teachers t

F. This money is needed so we will be able to maintain reduced class sizes

A. Because none of this money can be taken away by the State for other school
districts, all the money raised by this measure will stay here in our local
community to be used by our local schools

0. This parcel tax is needed to replace the money that already has been
cut from the District's budgets over the past two years

49%

B, This money is needed if

ihools are to remain among the best in nation 0

C. An independent oversight committee will make sure money is spent properly

Mary Solseng, Assistant Assessor
Santa Clara County Assessor’s Office
70 West Hedding St., East Wing
5th Floor

San Jose, CA 95110
Dear Ms. Solseng,

This will confirm our meeting on Friday, January 21, 2005 at 3:30 p.m. in Irene Lui’s office in the
Finance Department, as well as the agenda for the meeting. Although the Assessor’s Office
does not project property tax revenues, you can provide data and analytical tools that will assist
us in our projections.

The specific items I would like to examine with you are:

1.	A trend analysis of property tax receipts for PAUSD over the past five years broken down by
commercial, residential, secured, and unsecured;

2.	A history of assessment growth and specific reductions including pending appeals for
assessment reductions;

3.	Development potential within the PAUSD assessment area; and

4.	Resources you would recommend to us regarding projections of assessed valuation and
property tax collections.

If you have any questions prior to the meeting, you may contact me at 650-329-3801.

Thank you for your assistance.

Notes:

1.	The state income for K-3 CSR in 2003-04 was reduced by $460,748 due to the state's categorical funding reduction to Basic Aid districts. State revenues for future years are adjusted with projected state Cost of Living Adjustments
(COLAs) and enrollment growth.

2.	Funding from the district general fund includes contributions to both the district program funded by parcel tax revenue (grades 4-8 and 10) and the state programs (K-3 and 9th grade). In 2004-05, the projected contribution to the district
program is $1,401,561 and the contribution to the state programs is $1,199,492.

Impact of Budget Reductions on High Schools

Due to current economic conditions, falling commercial property tax revenue in Palo Alto, declining State
revenues, an increase in the cost of health care benefits, and growing enrollment, our District has been
forced to cut $6.5 million over the past two years, and use over $3.4 million in one time money. Our
secondary schools have had a loss of $3.7 million ($2.1 million in the high schools and $1.6 million in the
middle schools).

Our high schools have experienced a reduction in administrators, teaching and support staff, and a
reduction in per pupil allocations from the State and District. The high schools have attempted to offset
budget reductions. However, these budget cuts are impacting our high school programs.

Our High Schools Have Lost Teaching Periods

Each high school has been reduced 10 teaching periods. These “flexible periods” allowed the high schools
to offer a rich elective program. While schools continue to be staffed according to contractual agreements,
many electives with lower enrollments are not being offered this year. For example:

•	At Palo Alto High School, AP Physics, American Sign Language I, German 1, AP Art History,
American Lit, World Lit 12, American Classics Honors, Shakespeare/Chaucer, Introduction to
Gender Study, Ethnic Studies, and Sports Medicine will not be offered this year.

•	At Gunn High School, Multicultural Literature, African American History, American Studies,
Introduction to Business Communication, Computer Applications, and History of Women in
America will not be offered.

•	The loss of staffing allocations over the past two years has also eliminated additional classroom
support at each high school for Digital High School, Site Technology, AVID Coordination, and
Senior Projects.

•	The student to teacher counseling formula changed from 360:1 to 400:1, along with a reduction
of a school psychologist from a full-time to half-time position.

Our High Schools Have Lost Administrators

Our high school administrative staff has been cut to a minimum. Previously, each high school had a
principal and three assistant principals. Each high school now has a principal and two assistant principals,
a 25% reduction in administrative staff, at the same time we have experienced student enrollment growth.
As a result:

•	Administrative responsibilities have been reassigned to the principal and assistant principals.

•	Each high school has created a Dean's position (using classroom staffing allocation) to support
student discipline and attendance.

Our High Schools Have Lost Classified Staff Positions

The reductions in classified staff positions over the past two years have impacted teachers, students, and

administrators. For example:

•	Reproduction technicians have been reduced and teachers now do much of their own copying of
materials, a poor use of teachers’ time.

•	The athletic assistant position has been eliminated and coaches or the athletic director are now
responsible for field and equipment set ups, transportation arrangements, and field trip
paperwork for classes missed on game days.

•	Attendance secretarial help has been reduced resulting in a loss of time to monitor attendance
and send attendance notifications to parents.

•	Allocations for Computer Lab Specialists have been reduced at both high schools.

Our High Schools Have Lost Per Pupil Allocations from the State and District

•	State allocations for various programs such as GATE (Gifted and Talented Education), SIP
(School Improvement Programs), Instructional Materials, School Library Funds, and Instructional
Technology have been reduced.

•	The District has been forced to reduce the high school allocation per pupil from $101 to $80. For
a student body of 1,700, this is a loss of $10,300.

•	Additionally, $40,000 in support for each high school’s athletic program has been cut over the
past two years, and $12,000 for Camp Anytown has been eliminated. Funds for teachers to
attend conferences, which supported professional development for teachers, were also totally
eliminated, resulting in a loss of approximately $9,000 at each high school.

Our High Schools Have Attempted to Offset Budget Reductions

•	To offset these reductions, the high school principals reviewed areas where they might seek
additional funding sources, as well as areas where we might increase fees.

•	The high schools are now fundraising for a variety of needs. While some fundraising can be
done through service organizations (e.g. Kiwanis Club for Camp Anytown), most is done at the
parent/community level.

•	The loss of revenue has also resulted in increased costs to parents. For example, fees have
increased for sports participation, parking permits, student body cards, lab fees, and copies of
transcripts.

Our High Schools Are Among the Best in the Nation

Exceptional teachers, challenging programs, dedicated parents, and support from our community all

contribute to our high student achievement.

•	Ninety-five percent of our graduates go to college

•	Each year over 40 percent of Paly and Gunn students enroll in Honors and Advanced Placement
classes

•	Over 70 percent of our graduates complete the rigorous “A-G” University of California
Admissions Requirements for high school course work

•	Over 90 percent take the SAT College Board Exam with a combined Verbal and Math score
averaging 1250

MEMORANDUM

To:	Dr. Mary Frances Callan, Superintendent

Palo Alto Unified School District

From:	Gene Bregman

Date:	January 12, 2005

Re:	Increases in Voter Support

Per our discussion last night at the Board of Education meeting, this
memo looks at the incremental increase in voter support that can be gained as
the parcel tax level is reduced. For this assessment, we have examined the
results of our surveys for the Palo Alto Unified School District that were
conducted in April, 2004 and January, 2001.

In 2004, reducing the parcel tax increase in increments of $60, from $240
to $180 to $120 above the current $293, gained just three percent and an
additional one percent, respectively, from 69 percent to 73 percent, and finally,
74 percent supporting the tax increase.

In 2001, we started at 58 percent support for a $400 tax and gained just
three percent, to 61 percent, for a $300 tax. A significant increase came when
the tax level declined to $175, with an increase in support of 11 percent, to 72
percent favoring the $175 tax.

Except for the relatively low tax level of $175, incremental increases in the
levels of support were never more than 3 percent, regardless of whether the tax
rate dropped by $100 or $60. In essence, there is a core of opposition to any
parcel tax increase that limits the effects of reducing the tax rates. To have a
significant impact on voter support beyond what can be achieved with a total tax
of $493 this year, we believe it will take a correspondingly significant reduction in
the tax rate, approaching or perhaps even below the $450 level.

Palo Alto Unified School District Quality Public Education Preservation Act of 2005
INTRODUCTION

instruction, maintain manageable class sizes, and preserve educational programs that attract the

learning by our community’s children, shall the Palo Alto Unified School District be authorized

to levy a qualified special tax in an amount not to exceed $_per year for_____years

beginning as of July 1, 2005, assessed against each parcel of taxable land in the District? Said
qualified special tax would replace the qualified special tax approved by the voters of the District
on June 5, 2001,

ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES

If the special taxes are approved, the Board of Education will implement the following
accountability measures in accordance with State law:

(a)	A statement, as set forth above, indicating the specific purposes of the qualified special tax,

(b)	a requirement that the proceeds be applied only to the specific purposes identified above,

(c)	the creation of an account into which the proceeds shall be deposited, and

(d)	an annual report pursuant to Section 50075.3. of the Government Code.

PURPOSE

To provide local revenue that cannot be taken by the State and to maintain the high quality of
neighborhood schools, the Palo Alto Unified School District proposes to levy a qualified special

tax for a period of____years, beginning July 1, 2005, at the rate of $____per year on each

assessor’s parcel located within the School District, with an exemption annually available for
senior citizens, and to implement accountability measures in connection with the special tax to
provide oversight and accountability to ensure that funds are used to:

A-l

DRAFT

1/20/2005

•	Restore programs and replace funds lost or reduced due to budget cuts;

•	Sustain achievement in reading, writing, and mathematics for all students at all grade
levels by avoiding increases in class size, while maintaining the ability to attract and
retain quality teachers;

•	Maintain essential academic programs, including science, reading, math, music, and art;

•	Protect the taxpayers’ investment in education and ensure District accountability by
providing for oversight and independent financial audits of revenues and expenditures.

The Board of Education will fund all of the programs listed above, unless the Board of Education
determines in any given year that changes in student population, fiscal constraints, or other
changes in state or federal funding make doing so infeasible or inadvisable. In any event, the
Board of Education will not fund any program or reduction other than those listed above from
the proceeds of the special taxes.

SENIOR CITIZEN EXEMPTION AVAILABLE

An exemption from the special tax will be made available annually to each individual in the
District who will attain 65 years of age prior to July 1 of the tax year, and who owns a beneficial
interest in the parcel, and who uses that parcel as his or her principal place of residence, and who
applies to the School District on or before July 1, 2005, or July 1 of any succeeding tax year.
Any application for such exemption must be renewed annually.

ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES

In accordance with the requirements of California Government Code sections 50075.1 and
50075.3, the following accountability measures, among others, shall apply to the special taxes
levied in accordance with this Measure: (a) the specific purposes of the special tax shall be those
purposes identified above; (b) the proceeds of the special tax shall be applied only to those
specific purposes identified above; (c) a separate, special account shall be created into which the
proceeds of the special taxes must be deposited; and (d) an annual written report shall be made to
the Board of Education of the District showing (i) the amount of funds collected and expended
from the proceeds of the special taxes and (ii) the status of any projects or programs required or
authorized to be funded from the proceeds of the special taxes, as identified above.

PROTECTION OF FUNDING

Current law forbids any decrease in State or Federal funding to the District because of the
District’s adoption of a parcel tax. However, if any such funds are reduced because of the
adoption of this parcel tax, then the amount of the special taxes will be reduced annually as
necessary in order to restore such State or Federal funding.
