At the recent Budget Hearing, the City Council directed staff to bring back for discussion,
various items for consideration to place on the November ballot. If the Council chooses to
have any or all of these issues included in the November 2000 Ballot, it must include the
selected items in a resolution adopted tonight, under Item 9d, in order to meet the election
time guidelines. The various ballot measures are as follows:

1. An Increase of Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) from 8% to 10%.

This will bring the City of Ukiah to the same level as the County’s TOT rate. The
TOT is assessed on visitors who are staying in local motels. If approved by the
electorate, it will bring all motel accommodations within the County of Mendocino
into an equal competitive situation.

The City Council considered various Measures for the November ballot at the July 19,
2000 City Council meeting. A resolution was adopted to include Ballot Measures for
the City Clerk position being appointed rather than elected, for the Mayor’s position to
be appointed rather than elected, and for a choice of the Mayor’s term remaining a two-
year term or changing to a four-year term. In addition, there were several unanswered
questions surrounding the Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) discussion, which staff is
now bringing back for the Council’s review. Whether the issue is discussed or not, the
Council will have this information available for future reference.

The agenda item is prepared as follows: Discussion of election timelines and

Impartial Analyses of the Ballot Measures by the City Attorney are due to the
County Elections Department by August 11,2000, with all arguments for/against
the Ballot Measures to be submitted by August 15, 2000.

Though the actual cost for each ballot measure will not be determined until the
total number of Measures has been submitted to the County Clerk, the City will
be charged by the number of pages submitted, including arguments for the
Measures. Total City cost for the election in 1998 was $7,534, and the budgeted
estimate for this year is $10,000.

Information Regarding the TOT and Possible Effects on the City of Ukiah -

The recently approved Fiscal Year 2000-01 Budget contains an estimate of
$235,000 for TOT. However, two Site Development Permit applications for new
motels have been submitted to the Planning Department. If they are approved
by the Planning Commission and/or City Council, there will be an additional 127
rooms within the City limits. The following is an analysis of the current room
base increasing from an 8% to 10% TOT and then the same calculation based
on the additional 127 rooms.

Current Motels	Current	+ 2 New Motels

TOT 8%	$235,000	$467,578

TOT 10%	$293.750	$584.473

Difference	$ 58,750	$116,895*

*Based on $116,895, by 2005, City will receive $584,473 additional revenue

As seen by the table, under the assumption that the two new hotels will be
approved, an additional $116,895 of revenue in the first year will be available for
City programs. Council discussed several possibilities for the use of this money
and if the desire is to allocate portions of the funding toward worthwhile projects
there are many to be considered. As we discussed during our Long-Range
Capital Improvement Program discussion, there are several classifications of
projects for the City to consider; those that are mandated, recommended, or
desirable.

In reviewing Council discussions over the last several years of various projects
or enterprises that it thinks are worthwhile, but that we do not have the ability to
help fund, there are several that come to the forefront. One is completion of
economic development and tourism brochures that will be kept up to date and
contain information that is accurate and informative for both the business and
tourism industries. There are a variety of outlets for increasing tourism and
promoting the Ukiah area, which could individually be analyzed and presented to
the Council for approval of funding. In addition, the Redevelopment Agency is
considering the expansion of the Facade Improvement Program. The TOT funds

could be used to expand the program boundaries.

Once the City’s website is functioning, there are a variety of economic and
tourism marketing tools that could be employed, including a motel guide with
pictures of each motel and rooms, along with telephone numbers and references
for each motel. This, of course, would require continual funding to monitor and
modify any changes in the local motel industry. Other local projects that have
been of interest and under discussion by the Council have included the
skateboard park, the recreation center, and development of Riverside Park.

Since visitors in the area will pay this additional TOT, any and all of these
recreational activities would be of benefit to visitors spending time in our
community.

3.	City Attorney’s Response to Several Questions Asked at the Previous
Council Meeting - The City Attorney opines that increasing the TOT only
requires a majority vote as long as the measure does not specify how the tax
revenues must be used. If the tax measure specifies the use of the revenues it
becomes a special tax and requires a 2/3 favorable vote to pass. These
requirements are contained in Article 13 C section 2 (b) of the State Constitution
that was enacted by Proposition 218.

Summary

Staff is requesting Council to:

1.	Discuss desired verbiage for City Clerk and Mayor Ballot Measures

2.	Discuss desired verbiage for draft Arguments for the City Clerk and Mayor
Ballot Measures

3.	Determine if TOT increase from 8% to 10% should be included on the
ballot

4.	Adopt resolution presenting Ballot Measures and Arguments for the
November 2000 ballot.

Argument in Favor of Measure: Appointed City Clerk

Please join us in making Ukiah city government more efficient. Two-thirds of all California
cities now appoint their City Clerks. The central importance of the position makes it
imperative that the position be filled by a professionally qualified person, rather than through
the political election process. Whether elected or appointed, the Clerk is governed by the
rules of the Government Code, with the City Attorney as chief advisor.

It is imperative that the City Clerk maintains impartiality. The importance of accurate and
unbiased reporting and record keeping of City policy and actions of the City Council requires
that the Clerk act in an impartial manner.

The City Clerk position should be filled from a pool of qualified candidates, using techniques
that objectively compare qualifications and ability to perform the technical requirements of the
job, such as the ability to understand and interpret codes, competency in record keeping,
computer literacy, and administrative skills among others. Currently the only requirements
to run for office are that the candidate is 18 years of age, a United States citizen, and a
registered voter residing in the City of Ukiah. Under this ballot measure the City will hire the
City Clerk, and may fire them if job performance is not satisfactory.

Continuity is an essential element of the City Clerk’s office. Appointment of the Clerk allows
the Clerk to fully concentrate on his/her duties in an uninterrupted manner by eliminating the
uncertainty and time involved in the election process. A City Clerk whose tenure is not limited
by election can provide continuity and stability in conducting the business of the City. This
continuity allows the Clerk to gain a historical perspective on City government, thus be better
able to respond to the public’s inquires and requests.

Argument in Favor of Measure: Appointed Mayor

By determining to make the office of Mayor elective, the citizens of Ukiah actually
reduced rather than increased their right to elect their City official. Since the
elected Mayor serves for a two-year term, while the remaining four City
Councilmembers serve for a four-year term, a Councilmember may need to
vacate his/her Council seat with two years remaining when running for Mayor. In
this instance, the Council appoints a citizen to fill the vacant seat due to the
considerable cost of calling a special election, which takes the election of the
public official out of the direct hands of the people. While not intended to do so,
this situation has resulted in an increased number of City Council representatives
being appointed rather than elected by the voters.

When the Mayor‘s position is appointed from sitting City Councilmembers, the
person has still been elected by the public, as a City Councilmember. The Mayor
is primarily a ceremonial position who sits as the presiding officer of the City
Council, represents the City during ceremonial occasions, and whose vote
counts only as a fifth Councilmember. The Mayor is not the administrative head
of City government and is not in charge of day-to-day management of the City.

For these reasons, the City Council believes that making the office of Mayor
appointive rather than elective will actually increase City residents’ opportunities
to directly elect City officials with no loss of voter control over their City
government and reduce the number of political appointments.

AGENDA SUMMARY REPORT

SUBJECT:	ADOPTION	OF RESOLUTION APPROVING USE OF INCREASE OF

TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX

At the August 2, 2000 City Council meeting, the Council approved placing the issue of
modifying the Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) from 8% to 10% within the City boundaries
on the November ballot. Additionally, the Council directed staff to return at the next
Council meeting with a resolution, which would designate these increased funds solely for
the purposes of:

1.	Promotion of the City of Ukiah and its tourist industry

2.	Beautification of commercial areas in the City of Ukiah

3.	Support of homeless shelters

4.	The acquisition or development of parks and open space in the City of Ukiah

The Council desires to adopt such a resolution to inform the community of how the
increased funds would be spent to improve, beautify, and promote the Ukiah area, if the
Ballot Measure is successful.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Adopt resolution designating use of increased TOT taxes, if
approved by electorate at November election.

ALTERNATIVE COUNCIL POLICY OPTIONS:

RESOLUTION OF THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF
UKIAH ESTABLISHING ALLOWABLE USES OF HOTEL-
MOTEL ROOM OCCUPANCY TAX REVENUES
RESULTING FROM AN INCREASE IN THE TAX RATE
FROM 8% TO 10%.

WHEREAS,

1.	The City of Ukiah in 1965 adopted Sections 1750-1763 (Chapter 8A of
Division One) of the Ukiah City Code (“UCC”), establishing a hotel-motel room
occupancy tax by an ordinance known as the Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax
Ordinance; and

2.	Said tax is a general excise tax imposed on each transient paying for the
privilege of occupying any hotel or motel located within the City; and

3.	The revenues produced by the Hotel-Motel Room Occupancy Tax are
deposited into the City’s general fund and used for general governmental purposes of
the City; and

4.	At least since1990, the rate of tax has been established by UCC Section
1752 at 8% of the rent charged by a hotel or motel operator to stay in a room in the
hotel or motel; and

5.	The City Council has determined to present to the voters of the City at the
Statewide General election scheduled for November 7, 2000, a measure which would
increase the tax rate provided in UCC Section 1752 to 10% of the rent charged by a
hotel or motel operator (“rate increase”), but would make no other changes to the
Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance; and

6.	If the rate increase is approved by a majority vote of the voters in the
November 7, 2000, election, the Hotel-Motel Room Occupancy Tax will remain a
general excise tax in the City to be used for the general governmental purposes of the
City; and

7.	The City Council expects the revenues from the City’s Hotel-Motel Room
Occupancy Tax to increase in the coming years due to the increase in the number of
hotels and motels within the City; and

8.	The City Council also expects an increase in revenues deposited in the
general fund resulting from the rate increase if it is approved by the voters; and

9.	The City Council wants to inform the voters of the City and future City

Councils how it expects to spend the revenue increase to the City resulting from the
rate increase;

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED as follows:

1.	The City Council shall use increased revenues that may result from the tax
increase exclusively for the following purposes:

A.	Promotion of the City of Ukiah and its tourist industry;

B.	Beautification of commercial areas in the City of Ukiah;

C.	Support of homeless shelters; and

D.	The acquisition or development of parks and open space in the City of
Ukiah;

2.	Prior to conducting public hearings on the annual budget, the Finance
Director shall report to the City Council the total tax revenues attributable to the tax
increase projected for the next fiscal year, commencing July 1. The projection shall be
based on the actual revenues received from the tax increase in the previous fiscal year
and reasonable assumptions about the potential change in such revenues for the
upcoming fiscal year. A specific budget for the use of these revenues among the
categories specified in Section 1 of this Resolution shall be prepared and approved
each year as part of the City Council’s approval of the annual budget for the City of
Ukiah.

3.	The City Council does not intend any portion of this resolution to change the
Hotel-Motel Room Occupancy Tax from a general excise tax to a special tax or
assessment. If a court of competent jurisdiction were to determine in a final, non-
appealable judgment that this resolution or any portion thereof converts such tax or all
or any portion of the revenues produced by such tax from a general tax to a special tax
or assessment, then this resolution is and shall be to that extent null and void.

2.	Property Tax Transfer.

According to the City Finance Director, Chapter 8B of the City of Ukiah Municipal
Code establishes the Real Property Transfer Tax. This section of the Code was
adopted in 1967. The scope of the tax is identified in Chapter 8B, Article 1, Section
1771: “There is hereby imposed on each deed, instrument or writing by which any
lands, tenements or other realty sold within the City shall be granted, assigned,
transferred or otherwise conveyed to, or vested in, the purchaser or purchasers, or
any other person or persons, by his or their direction, when the consideration or
value of the interest or property conveyed (exclusive of the value of any lien or
encumbrances remaining thereon at the time of sale exceeds one hundred dollars
($100.00), a tax at the rate of twenty seven and one-half cents ($0,275) for each
five hundred dollars ($500.00) or fractional part thereof.”

This tax is collected when the sale of property is recorded with the County
Recorder’s office. The title companies calculate the amount of the tax when they
prepare the real estate closing documents. The County collects the property
transfer tax, in the amount of $.55 per $500 of selling price; $0,275 for the County
and $0,275 for the City. According to the State Revenue and Taxation Code, a
County may impose up to $.55 for each $500 of selling price, half of which comes
to the City. Since the County of Mendocino is already receiving the maximum levy
under state law, we are precluded from increasing the current rate. Secondly, if the
Council determined it wanted to eliminate receiving its portion of this tax, the full
$.55 per $500 would revert to the County and the taxpayer would not, in fact, see a
reduction.

3.	Assigning Numbered Council Seats.

Councilmember Baldwin has requested discussion regarding each Councilmember
having a numbered seat whereby candidates can run for specific seats and
members of the public would vote for each individual seat. Currently, the
candidate(s) securing the highest number of votes in descending order are selected
for the vacant seat(s).

According to the City Attorney, state law does not allow cities to have numbered
Council seats. There are several alternatives allowed by State Statute which
includes our current method and also the formation of Districts within the City limits.
The City Attorney will discuss this in more detail at the meeting.

4.	Elected Versus Rotational Mayor: Four-Year Term.

The Mayor is currently elected for a two-year term. This became effective in the
mid 80s, after a majority vote at a general election. Before that time, the Mayoral
position was rotational among Councilmembers. The Council further discussed the
possibility of a four-year versus two-year term for Mayor if it continued to be an
elected office.
