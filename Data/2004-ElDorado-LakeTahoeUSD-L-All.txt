PROPOSING A QUALIFIED SPECIAL TAX AND
ESTABLISHING SPECIFICATIONS OF THE ELECTION ORDER

WHEREAS, the Lake Tahoe Unified School District (“District”) is being forced to increase
class size, curtail essential education services and risks losing experienced teachers due to inadequate
funding from the State Legislature; and

WHEREAS, increased revenues are necessary to sustain and improve student educational
programs, keep all five local elementary schools open and sustain small class sizes in grades K-3 as

long as fiscally viable, and insure qualified staff; and

WHEREAS, the District has engaged in a variety of efforts to generate funds for the District
to meet its educational goals, including lobbying in the State Legislature, local fundraising efforts,
and cost-cutting measures, but these efforts have not produced sufficient revenues to sustain valued
instructional programs that provide children with a well-rounded education; and

WHEREAS, funding from the State of California (the “State”) has not been adequate to meet
these goals, and the District has no assurance that State funding will in the future pennit the District
to meet these goals; and

of the District’s budget and is insufficient to meet these goals, and the District has no assurance that
Federal funding will in the future permit the District to meet these goals; and

WHEREAS, the District has conducted a public hearing in connection with the proposed
election regarding a qualified special tax prior to the adoption of this Resolution; and

reviewed annually by an independent citizen oversight committee in order to insure that all funds are
spent according to the proposal placed before the voters for approval by this Resolution; and

MEASURE L

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

(Prepared by the Office of the County Counsel)

The Dixon Public Library provides general library services through-
out the area served by the Dixon Unified School District. The
Library's primary source of revenue is ad valorem property taxes.
Article vt.- of the California Constitution restricts ad valorem

The actual tax rate could vary from year to year as determined by
the Board of Trustees of the Dixon Unified School District
Library District but it could not exceed the maximum amount
authorized by the voters without another election. The tax could
only be imposed for five fiscal years.

If approved, the special tax could be collected annually at the
same time and in the same manner as ordinary County ad valorem
property taxes and would be subject to the same penalties and the
same procedures for sale of the real property in case of delin-
quencies as provided for in the case of ad valorem property
taxes.

A "yes" vote authorizes the Board of Trustees to impose a special
tax for general library purposes.

A "no" vote means that the Board of Trustees is not authorized to
raise additional revenues through the imposition of a special
tax.

s one which proposesa special tax which would be
normal property taxes. The special tax would be
year on all nonexempt real property within the
chool District at a maximum rate of $25 per parcel
t each fiscal year.



This measure passes if two-thirds of those voting on the measure
vote yes.

ARGUMENT FOR MEASURE L

Since its formation in 1912 the Dixon Library has continued to provide
library service to the greater Dixon area. The library’s primary function
has been to enrich the quality of life within our community. Without this
requested revenue the library will not be able to maintain the staff,
services and programs which the people of Dixon have enjoyed for 75 years.

The Dixon Library serves people of all ages who live in the City of Dixon
and the surrounding area. It provides an essential service for those who wish
to improve their knowledge by keeping up to- date on a variety of topics as well
as for those who enjoy recreational reading.

As a result of significant library revenue reductions since 1978
open hours have been cut, staff reduced, book and periodical acquisitions limited,
building maintenance repairs curtailed.

The Dixon Library is an Independent agency with limited income sources.

County property taxes collected for the Iibrary district and County Special
District Funds allocated by the Board of Supervisors provide the, library's
revenue. These funding sources are inadequate. Other sources of revenue have
been explored:	both grants and limited contributions have not provided enough

income to continue current services. Therefore, without the approval of MEASURE
L, which would provide a maximum $25.00 per parcel per year assessment for 5 years,
the library will have to further reduce-services.

A. YES vote on MEASURE L wi I I insure that library services being enjoyed
by this community will not further be limited or eventually lost.

VOTE YES ON MEASURE ’L'.
