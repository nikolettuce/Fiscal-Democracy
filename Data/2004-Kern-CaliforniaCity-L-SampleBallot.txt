ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF
MEASURE L
CITY OF CALIFORNIA CITY

Save Our Services! There is no city anywhere with a greater need to re-
new a special tax. We have over 50,000 privately-owned subdivided lots
in the City, and approximately 3,800 registered voters. This means that
every voter who votes for the special tax carries over 10 times the taxing
power to benefit the City, because every one of those property owners
supports the city with their special tax payments. While some absentee
owners object to the tax, the vast majority of them understand that it holds
up property values and therefore their investment.

What we pay now for special tax is our personal investment in our city;
public safety services, parks and recreation, street repair and mainte-
nance, and this time, funding for emergency repairs of water main breaks
that cost the city hundreds of thousands of dollars every year. The only
practical way to pay for the infrastructure needs of our city is a special tax.
Passage of Measure “L” is a renewal of our previous $75.00 special tax
for three years, not a new tax on top of old.

Without a special tax:

fewer police and firemen

no parks or recreation services

less street improvement or maintenance

no investment in infrastructure

With a special tax:

protect public safety

keep recreation programs

continue street repairs and maintenance

contribute to the repair and replacement of water lines

services at near current levels

The most important reason for a California City special tax is that it is the
only one we do not share with County, State or Federal agencies. Vote
^“Yes” on Measure “L”. Save Our Services.

ARGMEASL

ARGUMENT AGAINST
MEASURE L
CITY OF CALIFORNIA CITY

Proposition 13 is a California state law preventing the Sacramento politi-
cians from hideous property' tax increases.

Now' our own local politicians have circumvented the law, and decided to
arbitrarily raise property taxes any amount at any time. We are talking
about a percentage increase of from fifteen to over one hundred percent.

We the citizens of California city have just voted down the extra tax in
March. Now the city council has the audacity to ask for another vote two
months later.

Renters if you think this tax doesn’t affect you, your mistaken, your rent
will increase.

Please vote no!!

No new taxes!!

s/John Przybyszewski, A concerned citizen

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST
MEASURE L
CITY OF CALIFORNIA CITY

Proposition 13 is a statewide law passed by the voters to limit the amount
of property taxes paid by property owners. Special Taxes at the local level
are also passed by the voters to counter-act the negative effects on small
cities of Proposition 13. They are NOT enacted by the City Council.

California City’s special taxes prior to and following 1998 are not “cir-
cumventing the law”, but in fact are voted into law by the voters who real-
ize the need for them to keep city services in place. The special tax has not
increased since it was reestablished in 1998.

The City has had its revenue taken over and over again without voter ap-
proval by the state legislature, which is determined to balance its budget
deficit on the backs of the counties and cities of California.

The MAJORITY of California City taxpayers went to the polls on March
2 to pass this tax again, 64% of them. Unfortunately for the city, the ma-
jority had to be 66.67%. A minority of voters were able to affect the qual-
ity of life in California City' for the MAJORITY. Thus, the City Council
believes it is important to take one more opportunity to gain the 2/3.rds ma-_
jority required to pass a tax, on June 8, 2004.

Don’t let a small minority' impact our city services and continued quality
of life in California City. Vote YES on Measure “L” on June 8th.
