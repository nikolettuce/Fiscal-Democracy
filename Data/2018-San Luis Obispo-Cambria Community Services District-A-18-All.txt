RESOLUTION 03-2018
February 8, 2018

A RESOLUTION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE
CAMBRIA COMMUNITY SERVICES DISTRICT
CALLING A SPECIAL ELECTION FOR SUBMISSION TO THE VOTERS OF A
PROPOSED ORDINANCE FOR LEVY OF A SPECIAL TAX ON REAL PROPERTY
LOCATED WITHIN THE DISTRICT TO FUND THREE (3) FULL TIME FIREFIGHTERS
AND RELATED INCREASE IN THE DISTRICT’S APPROPRIATION LIMIT, AND
REQUESTING CONSOLIDATION OF SAID SPECIAL ELECTION WITH THE JUNE 5,
2018 CONSOLIDATED STATEWIDE DIRECT PRIMARY ELECTION

WHEREAS, numerous studies have concluded that Firefighter staffing levels
directly affect the level of fire protection and prevention service delivery and that a
constant staffing level of a first in, four-person engine company is necessary to provide
for the overall safety of the Firefighters and the community; and

WHEREAS, on September 10, 2015 the Board of Directors (Board) accepted the
2015 SAFER Grant Award (Grant) under which the Cambria Community Services District
(CCSD) received funding for three (3) additional Firefighters for a two-year period, and
which allowed for the addition of one Firefighter on daily staffing and provided for a four-
person engine company consisting of a Captain, Engineer, SAFER-funded Firefighter and
a reserve Firefighter; and

WHEREAS, at the time the Grant was accepted, it was understood that unless
additional funding became available, at the end of the period of time covered by the Grant,
the SAFER-funded Firefighter positions would end and the staffing would have to go back
to a three-person staffed engine; and

WHEREAS, three-person staffed engines limit Firefighters to a defensive posture
whereby they can simply respond to a working fire, surround it and drown it, which
potentially can lead to preventable losses of both life and property; and

WHEREAS, in June, 2017, as part of the approval of the 2017-2018 fiscal year
budget, the Board approved the transfer of $84,000 from General Fund reserves to
continue to pay for the salaries of the SAFER-funded Firefighters; however, it has been
determined that the District has insufficient funds to continue the four-person engine
company staffing in future years; and

WHEREAS, pursuant to the provisions of Government Code Section 61121(a) and
Government Code Sections 50075, et seq., the Board is authorized to levy a special tax,
subject to the approval of the voters; and

WHEREAS, in order to provide the best fire protection services to Cambria and
have a Fire Department staffed and prepared to provide aggressive interior fire attack
when appropriate, and accomplish both victim rescue and property conservation,
additional funding must be sought to continue to provide for four-person engine
companies and therefore the Board desires to place a ballot measure before the voters
at the June 5, 2018 election for approval of a proposed Ordinance to levy a special tax
on real property within the District to fund three (3) full time firefighters; and

WHEREAS, in accordance with the requirements of Government Code Section
50077, on February 5, 2018, the Board of Directors conducted a noticed public hearing
on the issue of whether to place such a measure on the ballot. The notice included the
date, time and place of the public hearing, a general explanation of the matter to be
considered, and a statement of where additional information could be obtained. The
February 5, 2018 public hearing was continued to February 8, 2018; and

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors desires to have the County of San Luis Obispo
render certain services in connection with the special election; and

WHEREAS, pursuant to Elections Code Sections 10555 and 10400 et seq., said
election may be consolidated with any other election, pursuant to the procedures set forth
in the Elections Code.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Directors of the Cambria

3.	It is hereby requested that the Board of Supervisors of San Luis Obispo County
consolidate the special election of the CCSD to be held on June 5, 2018 with any
other San Luis Obispo County General Election held on the same date. This

to identify each parcel for the calculation of the special tax applicable to that parcel in the

PASSED AND ADOPTED by the People of the Cambria Community Services District at
a special election held on June 5, 2018.

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE A-18

This measure has been placed on the ballot by the Board of Directors (“the
Board") of the Cambria Community Services District ("the District") and is intended
to determine whether an ordinance imposing a special tax on all real property
within the District shall be approved by the voters of the District for the purpose of
funding three full-time firefighters to provide fire prevention and protection
services within the District.

If this measure is approved, an ordinance shall be enacted imposing a special
tax on all real property within the District and increasing the District's appropriation
limit in an amount equal to the taxes imposed. Pursuant to California Constitution,
Article XIIIA, section 4, and Article XI11C, section 2, and Government Code section
50075, the Board is authorized to impose a special tax if approved by a two-thirds
vote.

The Ordinance sets an annual special tax of sixty-two dollars and fifteen
cents ($62.15) on each parcel of real property within the District. The ordinance
defines "parcel" to mean each parcel of real property having a separate assessor's
parcel number as shown on the last equalized assessment roll of San Luis Obispo
County.

If the measure is approved, commencing with fiscal year 2019/20 and for

each fiscal year thereafter, the maximum amount of the special tax shall increase

by the average percentage by which the Consumer Price Index, as described in the
full text of the measure, increased in the twelve months prior to March of the
calendar year in which the adjustment is made.

In accordance with Article XIIIC, Section 2(d) of the California Constitution, the
ordinance providing for the special tax will only become effective if approved by a
two-thirds vote. Pursuant to Article XI11B, section 4, voter-approved increases in the
District's appropriations limit may only be in effect for four years. Therefore, in
order for the increased appropriations limit resulting from the special tax to
continue, it must be approved by the voters every four years.

A "yes" vote on this measure is a vote in favor of imposing a special tax for
the purposes of providing funding for three full-time firefighters to provide fire
prevention and protection services within the District.

A "no" vote on this measure is a vote against imposing a special tax for the
purposes of providing funding for three full-time firefighters to provide fire
prevention and protection services within the District.

Argument in Favor of Measure A-18 (285 words)

By voting YES on measure A-18, you are supporting a lasting improvement to the
emergency response capabilities within our community. Cambria Community
Services District Fire Department (CCSDFD) has proudly served Cambria for over
140 years and has become an all- hazard emergency agency. CCSDFD responds to
fires emergency medical calls, vehicle accidents, ocean and cliff-side rescue
incidents, and non-emergency calls for service. With required entry level training of
almost 800 hours, there has been a steady decline in volunteerism. The CCSDFD
has taken purposeful steps to provide the most effective and economically efficient
emergency services possible within its budget limitations.

In March of 2016, CCSDFD was awarded a federal grant to fund 3 additional
firefighters for two years. This has allowed Cambrians the benefit of 3 career personnel
plus 1 reserve on duty, for a total of 4. This grant was not renewed, so an additional
funding source is needed to maintain the staffing levels.

Your YES vote on Measure * will be used exclusively to fund 3 career firefighter
positions. This is consistent with:

•	National federal and state safety requirements

•	Response to recommendation of County of San Luis Obispo Grand Jury

•	Recommendation of Multi-Jurisdictional Hazard Mitigation Plan for CCSD and
CCHD

•	Recommendation of County of San Luis Obispo Emergency Response Plan
We live in an isolated, rural area and face unique challenges in responding to
emergencies. CCSDFD is committed to ensuring that we keep up with the increasing
public safety needs of the community.

Your YES vote on Measure A-18 will be used exclusively to fund 3 career
firefighter positions. This staffing model enhances the safety of our community
and will support continuation of the wide range of emergency and community
services the Fire Department of CCSD provides.

ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE A-18

Voters who are asked to approve any new tax should start with a simple question: Is this
tax really necessary?

In the case of Measure A-18, which would tax Cambrians to pay for extra full-time
firefighter positions at a starting cost of $378,000 a year, the answer is clearly “no.”

To see why, let’s look at some facts:

First, the Cambria Fire Department operated until 2016 with engine company crews of
three. Can you recall any significant concerns being raised back then about the safety or
effectiveness of our firefighters? We cannot. The fact is that they were doing a fine job
with three-person crews.

Second, the resolution to put this measure on the ballot cited only one specific advantage
of four-person crews. This is the ability to “provide aggressive interior fire attack,” with
two firefighters going into a burning structure while two stay outside. But Cambria Fire
can do this without the extra firefighters, because our community has not just one but two
fire departments. The other one is Cal Fire, which AUTOMATICALLY responds to all
fire calls in Cambria. Cal Fire has at least two firefighters (three or four in wildfire
season) at its Cambria station. So even with three-person Cambria Fire crews, there will
be at least five firefighters at any fire.

Third, this tax does not protect Cambria from a truly serious threat, that of catastrophic
wildfire. It does not pay for clearing dead and dying trees or creating defensible space
around homes and around the town as a whole. In fact, the language of Measure A-l 8
EXPLICITLY BARS spending the tax proceeds on anything other than three added
firefighter positions.

Measure A-18 is not needed for our community’s safety. It is not needed for the safety of
firefighters. We urge you to vote NO.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE A-18

The argument for Measure A-18 leaves out important facts and gets others wrong,
such as:

•	Proponents of the parcel tax say that Cambria depends on the CCSD Fire
Department (Cambria Fire) for more than just firefighting.

That’s not the whole story. Cambria Fire does not work alone. Agencies not
mentioned in the “pro” argument — Cal Fire, the Cambria Community Healthcare
District’s ambulance service, the County Sheriff and the CHP — also serve
Cambria. This well-run emergency system does not need extra firefighters to do
its job.

•	The “pro” argument points to “national federal and state safety requirements.” But
these requirements are already met by Cal Fire and Cambria Fire working
together.

•	The Grand Jury has not recommended raising Cambria Fire staffing levels. Nor
has the CCSD mentioned fire staffing in its responses to the Grand Jury.

•	San Luis Obispo County’s Emergency Operations Plan (the correct title) says
nothing about needing extra firefighters. A 2014 County document suggests
adding professionals “to augment existing volunteer forces,” but Cambria Fire is
already fully professionalized.

•	The proponents cite “increasing public safety needs,” In fact, fires in Cambria are
trending downward and ambulance calls are not increasing.

Moreover, the cost to fund these three extra firefighters begins at $378,000 a year.

Along with cost-of-living and “step” increases, taxpayers will face rising pension

and healthcare costs for the extra firefighters for decades to come.

We Cambrians support our firefighters. But this tax increase is not necessary. We urge
you to vote NO on Measure A-18.

Rebuttal to Argument Against Measure A-18

It is true that the Cambria Fire Department operated with three firefighters per shift prior to the
awarding of the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) Grant. Note the name of
the grant... SAFER. FOUR person staffing per shift is deemed ADEQUATE for fire and emergency
response by NFPA, FEMA and OSHA. "The goal of SAFER is to enhance the local fire departments'
abilities to comply with staffing, response and operational standards established by the NFPA (NFPA
1710 and/or NFPA 1720)."

Cambrians do benefit from having CAL FIRE located within our community, and their personnel
frequently assist on large scale incidents. But remember, their primary mission is the protection of
California's wildland. In the last 10 years, there have been 157 fires, within our community. 100 of
those fires required other agencies to respond. Of those, 61 times Cambria Fire Department was on
scene for an average of 4.46 minutes prior to receiving any assistance. That is a long time for firefighte
to wait to enter a burning building and see if one of our mostly elderly community members needed
rescue.

Measure A-18 is solely for funding the staffing necessary to maintain a four-person crew - 3 full-time
and 1 reserve on a daily basis. We know fire is an ever-present concern, and A FOUR firefighter crew
makes us SAFER. VOTE YES ON MEASURE A-18.
