ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF
COUNTYWIDE EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES
ADVISORY MEASURE H ELECTION
TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 1988

A “YES” vote on MEASURE "H” may save your life! A '‘YES" vote on MEASURE “H" urges
the Board of Supervisors and city councils to assure that enough paramedics are available
for all emergency calls and to provide a means to make needed improvements in our emergency
medical services. Emergency medical services are designed to provide rapid lifesaving re-
sponse to victims of heart attacks, serious injuries, and other life threatening medical
emergencies. Paramedics, under medical direction from hospital emergency doctors and
nurses, bring advanced medical skills, equipment , and drug therapy directly to the emergency
scene. Right now there are not enough paramedic units to respond to manv emergence calls.
ONE OUT OF SIX 9-1-1 CALLS FOR EMERGENCY MEDICAL HELP DOfiS NOT RECEIVE
A PARAMEDIC RESPONSE.

The radio system paramedics rely on to receive on-scene medical direction is old and
cannot handle the existing number of emergency calls. Medical dispatchers need to be trained
to assist 9-1-1 callers waiting for help to arrive. Firefighters who are first responders to
emergency medical incidents need to be trained to the recommended Emergency Medical
Tkchnician-I level and need to be trained and equipped with advanced lifesaving equipment
approved by the State for use by first responders prior to arrival of paramedics.

For less than 3c per day per household, a "YES" vote on MEASURE “H will:

—	Add needed paramedic units.

—	Provide medical training and equipment for firefighters.

Upgrade emergency medical communications and dispatch, and

—	Ensure a high level of trauma care throughout the county.

Please vote “YES” ON MEASURE “H” and inake Contra Costa County a belter and safer
place for all ot us to work, play, and LIVE.
