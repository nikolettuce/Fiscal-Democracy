Impartial Analysis from Interim County Counsel
Sections 22710 and 9250.7 of the California Vehicle Code authorize the
establishment of the Mendocino County Abandoned Vehicle Authority
(AVA), as well as the imposition of a fee on all vehicles registered in
Mendocino County. The AVA Fee is charged at a rate of one (1) dollar for
every vehicle registered in the County, and three (3) dollars for certain
commercial vehicles registered in the County. The AVA Fees are
collected by the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and then
dispersed to the Mendocino County Abandoned Vehicle Authority. The
fees may only be used for the abatement, removal, and disposal of any
abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or inoperative vehicles, or vehicle parts
located on public or private property within Mendocino County. The AVA
Fee must be renewed every ten (10) years.

A YES vote would authorize the DMV to continue collecting the AVA Fee in
the amount of one (1) dollar for every vehicle registered in Mendocino
County, and three (3) dollars for certain commercial vehicles registered in
Mendocino County for a term of ten (10) years for the purpose of removal
and disposal of abandoned and wrecked vehicles.

A NO vote would mean that the DMV would not collect the AVA Fee and
the AVA is terminated.

This measure must be approved by two-thirds (2/3) vote of the electorate
for it to be effective.
