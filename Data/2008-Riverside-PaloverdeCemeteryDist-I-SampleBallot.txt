IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE "I'

The Board of Directors (the “Board ”) of the Palo Verde Cemetery District
(the “Cemetery District") has, by adopting its Resolution No. 1 (the
“Resolution”), elected to call a special election pursuant to Section 4 of
Article XHIA of the California Constitution, California Government Code
sections 50075 et seg. and California Election Code section 10406 to
obtain authorization to levy an annual special tax of one hundred dollars
($100) (the “special tax”) for the operation, maintenance, improvements,
expansions and future land acquisitions of the Cemetery District; and, to
provide “cost-free” interment of human remains, meeting the cultural,
economic, religious, and social needs of the Cemetery District. The
Board is proposing that the special tax be imposed on real property within
the boundaries of the Cemetery District.

Should Measure T be approved, the Resolution provides:

That the special tax shall take effect on June 4, 2008 and be
collected by the Riverside County Tax Collector at the same time, in
the same, and subject to the same penalties as ad valorem property
taxes collected by the Treasurer-Tax-Collector;

That unpaid special taxes shall bear interest at the same rate for
unpaid ad valorem property taxes until paid; and,

That the collection of the special tax shall not decrease the funds
available from other sources of the Cemetery District in any period
from the effective date.

The Board has called this election for the purposes of submitting this
measure to-the voters of the Cemetery District. For this measure to be
approved, two-thirds (2/3) of those persons voting on the measure must
vote yes. If approved, subject to conditions set forth in the Resolution, the
Cemetery District will be authorized to impose the special tax,

A “Yes” vote on Measure “I" is a vote to authorize the Cemetery District to
levy an annual special property tax in the amount of one hundred dollars
($100).

A "No" vote on Measure T is a vote against providing the Cemetery

District with the authorization to levy an annual special property' tax in the
amount of one hundred dollars ($100).

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure “I”. If
you desire a copy of the measure, please call the Registrar of
Voters office at (951) 486-7200 and a copy will be mailed at no
cost to you.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE “!’

With the rising cost of cemetery burials, Measure T will ease the burden
of this cost by providing the citizens of the district with cost free burials. It
will also enable the Palo Verde Cemetery District to continue operating
well into the future, and not rely upon the number of deaths of its citizens
per year to meet its annual budget. The Cemetery will be able to
purchase additional land and equipment and hire additional employees
to meet the needs of our growing community.

If this measure does not pass, the local residents of Blythe will face the
increasing cost of burials, limited office hours and no crews to maintain
the grounds. No chairs or microphones will be available for services and
the gates will be closed on the weekends. Please vote YES for Measure
T, Do if for our community, for our families, for the financial stability of
and the continued services provided by the Cemetery District.
