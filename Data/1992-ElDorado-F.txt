IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF REFERENDUM MEASURE

Measure Authorizing Additional Uses of State Revenues Derived
from Motor Vehicle Fuel Taxes. (Article XIX Status)

Article XIX of the State Constitution is a provision which
provides that no fees and taxes imposed by the state upon vehicles
or their use be expended for mass transit guideways except for
research and planning. The use of the revenues for construction
and improvements of mass transit guideways requires prior voter
approval. The purpose of this measure is to allow the County more
flexibility in the use of motor vehicle fuel revenues received from
the state. This measure does not cause additional taxes but
authorizes alternative uses of existing taxes.

A "Yes” vote on this measure is a vote in favor of the
enactment of a county ordinance authorizing the county to expend
state revenues allocated to the county from taxes imposed by the
state on motor vehicle fuels for purposes of acquisition and
construction of public mass transit guideways.

A "No" vote on this measure would continue to restrict the
county*s authority to expend said funds from motor vehicle fuel
taxes for the sole purpose of public mass transit research and
planning.
