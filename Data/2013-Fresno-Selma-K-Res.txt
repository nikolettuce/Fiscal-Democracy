A RESOLUTION OF THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF SELMA
APPROVING AN ORDINANCE AMENDING TITLE V, CHAPTER 15,
SECTIONS 1 and 3 (5-15-1 AND 5-15-3) OF THE SELMA MUNICIPAL CODE

INCREASING THE RATE OF THE TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX FROM
6% TO 12%; ORDERING THAT THE MEASURE TO INCREASE

THE TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX BE SUBMITTED TO THE VOTERS

OF THE CITY AT THE REGULAR, GENERAL ELECTION TO BE HELD
ON NOVEMBER 5, 2013, AND DIRECTING THE CITY ATTORNEY
TO PREPARE AN IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF THE MEASURE

The City Council of the City of Selma hereby finds as follows:

WHEREAS, Title V, Chapter 15 of the Selma Municipal Code provides for a
Transient Occupancy Tax to be imposed for the privilege of occupancy in any room, in
any hotel, inn, tourist home, house, motel or other lodging in the amount of 6% of the
rent charged by the operator which became effective on January 1, 1983, and the rate
of the tax thereby imposed has not been increased since that date; and

WHEREAS, the City of Selma's population has grown more than 25% in the last
ten years and occupancy rates of hotels and other lodging has similarly increased and
the need for and cost of city services as a result of persons occupying hotels within the
city has increased so that revenues created by the existing transient room tax of 6% of
the charges by the operator is inadequate to cover the cost of city services, including
public safety services, generated by the existence of persons occupying hotels within
the City; and

WHEREAS, section 7280 of the Revenue and Taxation Code authorizes any city
to levy a tax on the privilege of occupying a room or rooms, or other living space, in any
room, hotel, inn, tourist home, house, motel or other lodging, unless occupancy is for a
period of more than thirty days, and Revenue and Taxation Code section7285.9 permits
the governing body of any city to increase a tax imposed for general purposes if the
Ordinance proposing the tax increase is approved by a two thirds vote of all members of
the governing body and the tax is approved by a majority vote of qualified voters of the
city voting in an election on the issue.

NOW, THEREFORE, THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF SELMA HEREBY
RESOLVES as follows:

Section 1. Pursuant to its right, power and authority under the laws of the
State of California and the Selma Municipal Code, including but not limited to the
aforementioned provisions of the Revenue and Taxation Code and California Elections

election to be held in the city on November 5, 2013, to be consolidated with the

Chapter 15, Sections 1 and 3 (5-15-1 and 5-15-3) of the Selma Municipal Code,

6% to 12% of the rent charged by the operator of any hotel, inn, tourist home, house
motel or similar lodging for occupancy for a period of less than thirty days.
