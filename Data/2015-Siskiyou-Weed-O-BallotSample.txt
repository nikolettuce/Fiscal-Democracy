This ordinance has the effect of increasing the Transactions and Use (sales) tax paid
for taxable purchases of goods within the City of Weed by l/4th of 1%, that is, a
one cent tax increase on a transaction of $4.00.

The additional revenue realized from this tax increase will be used for general fund
purposes but will be accounted for and allocated separately from other general
funds, with special consideration to be given to library, senior services, police and
fire protection, and roadway maintenance expenses.

Every transaction within the City of Weed which is otherwise subject to state sales
tax will be affected, including purchases made by non-residents of the City, which
purchases have constituted the majority of such transactions.

The ordinance requires the affirmative vote of a majority of those voting in order to
go into effect.!2'
