ARGUMENT AGAINST PROPOSITION Z

This initiative is not what it appears to bel Its sponsors will tell you it is all about fairness,
representation, and democracy. The same kind of fairness and representation we get from our
other elected representatives. They will also tell you that elections will make the sponsor group
more accountable. Ask yourself this question, how representative and accountable do you feel
your elected represenlatives are to you? Exactly, you probably agree with us that they are primarily
accountable to special interests and big business that fund their campaigns and organize their
agendas. Changing to a larger elected planning group will enable these special interest groups
and big developers to get on the board and take our community away from us. You only have to
look at Alpine and Lakeside for excellent examples. Presently, this community Is protected by a
sponsor group that is elected at an open election and absolutely free to every honest, ordinary
citizen. Elections make money, organization and conviction (or the willingness to win at any price)
the decisive ingredients. Special interests and big developers have the money, superb
organizations and willingness to play dirty to win. A vote for this initiative is a vote for the following
favorite ideas of special interests or big developers: creation of a local design review committee;
restrictions on the use of your local roads; major subdivisions on the pristine landscape of the Star
Ranch; meters on your private wells; higher property taxes; and the list goes on and on. We have
a wonderful community and if you want it to stay that way vote against this initiative to change our
very effective sponsor group into a control grab by special interests and a land grab by big
developers. Vote for local control by voting no to this initiative.

Shame on current Sponsor Group Members Joe Sayatovich and Randy Lenac for using scare
tactics in their effort to convince people to vote against democracy. What are they afraid of? There
is no difference in the decision making powers between our present Sponsor Group and the
proposed Planning Group. The only difference is in how they are elected and who may serve.
Sponsor Group Members vote for themselves, whereas Planning Group Members are elected by
the residents of the community. To be a Sponsor Group Member one only has to own property in
Gampo (i.e. outside developers), whereas one must actually live here to serve on a Planning
Group. To say voting for an elected Planning Group is voting for major subdivisions, meters on
your wells, a local design review committee, restricting the use of local roads, and higher property
taxes is pure bunk. One could say the opposite is true - our Sponsor Group approved the original
project and the modifications to Campo's new 220 house subdivision. Converting to an elected
Planning Group is the only way to assure that local residents have a say in the development of
Campo. Local residents cannot remove a Sponsor Group Member who Is not representing the
wishes of the community. A Planning Group Member, on the other hand, can be voted out of office
or even recalled, thus making them more accountable to the community they serve. Bring
democracy to Campo - vote yes on Proposition Z.

COUNTY COUNSEL’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

You are asked to vote on the adoption of a special benefit tax to pay for structural fire
protection services within the boundaries of County Service Area 112-Campo. The special benefit
tax will be levied on a parcel, class of improvement to property and land use basis in amounts not
to exceed the following schedule:

Parcel, Class of Improvement

to Property, Use of Property

Residential

Multi-Unit Attached Residential

Commercial, Industrial

Institutional

Agricultural Building Over

2,000 square feet

For purposes of the special benefit tax, all single-family residences, mobile home units and trailers
will be considered equal and will not be subject to separate calculations. On each fifth anniversary
date, an adjustment may be made in the special benefit tax based on the increase in Consumer
Price Index for the San Diego area for the immediately preceding calendar year, not to exceed
$5.00.

Increases greater than those of the Consumer Price Index, as capped, may not be made
without approval of two-thirds of the voters within CSA 112-Campo, voting at an election on the
increase.

The special benefit tax shall go into effect within County Service Area 112-Campo July I,
2003, if approved by two-thirds of the voters voting at this election.

A “yes’' vote is a vote to approve the special benefit tax.

A "no’’ vote is a vote against the special benefit tax.

Maximum Special Benefit Tax

$50.00 per single-dwelling unit

$50.00 for the first dwelling unit
plus $20.00 per additional dwelling

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION BB

Campo Fire and Rescue has been underfunded since a $50.00 per household benefit fee ended in
1995. The only source of funding is $16,800.00 from County Property taxes. In 1998 a new benefit
fee proposition failed the required 2/3 majority by a small margin, leaving the department still
underfunded. In 1999, Supervisor Dianne Jacob, recognizing the dire need for new equipment
appropriated county funds for a new fire engine. This addition made it possible for volunteers to
respond to emergency calls with confidence in their equipment. From January to August 2002, the
department had responded to nearly 250 calls.

The department has recently been successful in reducing Campo’s fire insurance rating from ‘'10”
to "9” resulting in potential insurance premium savings to homeowners. Efforts are in progress to
reduce that rating to “8” or "7”, but funds to improve service are scarce. By supporting this new
benefit fee, residents will assure the continuity of this vital community service by providing funds
for liability insurance, fuel, equipment maintenance, and repairs to the World War ll-era fire station.

The department cannot continue to provide adequate fire protection and emergency medical
services without another source of funds beyond the property tax percentage, hence the need to
turn to the voters. Remember that Campo’s firefighters and board members are all volunteers.
Many of the firefighters drive from San Diego at their own cost to volunteer, even providing their
own meals and bedding. They simply ask that this community support their efforts by providing
sufficient funds to do the job properly. This benefit fee is an extremely small price to pay to have
help available promptly in emergencies.

Please vote “’YES” on Proposition BB for Service Area 112 - Campo Volunteer Fire and
Rescue; help yourself and your community.

Section 2. Such charges shall be charged to any parcel to which fire protection service

determined by the San Diego area by the U.S. Department of Labor. The maximum increase for
each of these reviews will not exceed $5. Increases greater than the increase of the Consumer
Price Index shall not be made unless they are authorized by a two-thirds vote of voters casting
ballots in the year for which such increases are proposed.

Section 5. Pursuant to Government Code Section 53978, the Special Benefit Tax

Resolution of the Board of Supervisors calling the election within the County Service Area.

voters voting on the question of adoption of the Special Benefit Tax.

Section 7. If the proposition is approved, the Board of Supervisors shall establish
schedules varying each of such Special Benefit Taxes according to value of benefits to each parcel
and according to availability of fire suppression equipment, apparatus, and personnel to the
affected parcel and improvement. However, the Special Benefit Tax shall not exceed the maximum
charges set forth in Section 1 hereof.

Section 8. If any portion of this Ordinance be declared unconstitutional, invalid or
otherwise unenforceable, the other provisions of this Ordinance shall remain in full force and effect.
