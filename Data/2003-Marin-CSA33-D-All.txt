IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL	ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE D
MEASURE D	
If this measure is approved by a two-thirds vote, County Service Area No. 33 will be formed and authorized to levy a special tax of Seventeen Dollars ($17.00) per year per parcel. The proceeds may be used only for the purposes set forth in the measure.	Please vote YES for this measure which will provide county maintenance for our Village Green. This will NOT increase our parcel tax burden because the new County Service Area will replace the old Landscaping and Lighting District and its $17 parcel tax. We and many others have been active with the Village Green II Committee to build the new park and urge your YES vote
If this measure is approved the existing lighting and landscaping district will be dissolved.	to fulfill this dream.
