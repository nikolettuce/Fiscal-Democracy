• By D«Witt W. Clinton, County Counsel

Approval of this ballot measure would allow the El Segundo Unified School
District to impose a special tax of up to $120 per year upon each parcel of real
property located wholly or partially within the District, effective immediately.

The precise amount of the tax would be determined each year by the Board
of Education following a public hearing. The maximum permissible yearly tax
of $120 authorized by this measure may not be exceeded by the Board in any
year in which the tax is assessed, but may be lower. The tax would be levied
each year for a maximum of 3 years.

Taxpayers 65 years of age or older who own and occupy single residential par-
cels may, upon application to the Board of Education, be granted an exemption
from the special tax. Taxpayers who own and occupy contiguous parcels used
for single family residential purposes may, upon application to the Board of
Education, have such parcels treated as a single parcel for purposes of the spe-
cial tax.

The special tax would be used to avoid a reduction in the present educational
program of the District, maintain quality classroom instruction in kindergar-
ten through twelfth grade, maintain vocational programs at the high school
level, provide instructional materials and maintain student health and safety.

The approval of the measure would also allow the District to increase for three
years the legal ceiling on expenditures currently imposed by the State Constitu-
tion, in an amount equal to the tax collected each year.

A two-thirds (2/3) vote is required for passage of the measure.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION B

On November 5, 1991, El Segundo voters will have the opportunity to ensure
that quality educational programs are maintained in the El Segundo Unified
School District over the next few years. Proposition B will:

-	Maintain quality classroom programs in academic instruction, such as read-
ing. writing, mathematics, foreign language, social studies, science, while
achieving high academic standards of student performance in Kindergarten
through Twelfth Grade.

-	Maintain vocational programs at the High School level.

-	Maintain textbooks, library books, and instructional materials to support
quality educational programs.

-	Maintain the health and safety of students.

Historically, El Segundo citizens have supported a high level of education
through local taxation. Since the passage of Proposition 13 and the Serrano
v. Priest Decision, which mandated equalized spending for education state-
wide, El Segundo has not received adequate funds from the State to maintain
essential programs. Each year for the past twelve years, the School District has
had to cut educational programs and teachers just to balance its budget. This
local tax, which is deductible from State and federal taxes, has a three-year
limit. Each year the Board of Education in a public hearing will schedule the
tax rate, which cannot exceed $120 per parcel. If in future years funds from
the State improve, the actual assessment will be reduced.

Although many citizens do not have children in the El Segundo public schools,
all benefit from the quality education through increased property valuation
and pride of community. This funding is urgently needed. Many program cuts
have already had to be made. Even with considerable supplemental funding
from the City of El Segundo. the District cannot maintain the high quality pro-
grams with the present level of funding from State and local taxes. The funding
from the City only assists in maintaining current educational programs for one
year and funds from the approval of this proposition will not be available until
six months after the City money has been expended.

Approval of Proposition B will maintain the quality programs while the State
reexamines and develops new educational financial formulas to guarantee
quality public education in the State of California.

Argument in Favor of Proposition B (Continued)

Each of us has taken advantage of our own special opportunities to be able
to live in this wonderful area. It is our responsibility to offer the children of
our community a solid educational foundation so they may meet the future
with talent and imagination. Two dollars and 30 cents ($2.30) a week or thirty-
eight cents (38«) per day from each household in the District can assure this
foundation. A “Yes” vote on Proposition B is a yes vote for the future of El
Segundo schools and its students.
