IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE A

Measure A, if approved by a majority vote, would reduce the City of Tulare Utility User’s Tax
on Communications from seven percent (7%) to six percent (6%), revise the method for
calculating and collecting that Tax to reflect technological advances and changes in State
and Federal Law, and ratify and approve the past collection of the Tax.

If approved by the voters, this Tax can not later be increased or changed without voter
approval.

The Measure will lower the tax rate from 7% to 6%. It will also update the existing ordinance
language to be consistent with changes in the technology of telecommunications services
and changes in State and Federal Laws and regulations enacted since the original adoption
of the Tax.

This Tax is a general tax and all revenues received would go to the City’s general fund to
provide essential services including, but not limited to: police, fire, streets, public works,
parks, recreation programs for seniors and youth, and the library. It is estimated that the Tax
will continue to provide approximately $1,400,000 for the 2007-2008 budget.

The Measure must be approved by a majority of the voters voting at this election.

THE ABOVE STATEMENT IS AN IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE A. IF YOU
DESIRE A COPY OF THE MEASURE, THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE OR THE EXISTING
ORDINANCE, PLEASE CALL THE TULARE CITY CLERK’S OFFICE AT 559-684-4200,
AND A COPY WILL BE PROVIDED TO YOU AT NO COST TO YOU.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR
MEASURE A

Shall Ordinance 07-05 be adopted to reduce the rate of the City of Tulare’s
Communications User’s Tax from 7% to 6%; to revise the method for calculating and
collecting the Utility Users’ Tax to reflect technological advances and changes in state
and federal law; and to ratify and approve the past collection of the Tax?

Measure A would reduce the City of Tulare’s current utility tax percentage on communication
services from 7 percent to 6 percent.

Over the years, the language of the existing ordinance has become outdated, resulting in
some persons being taxed while others are not, depending on what technology is being used,
which is unfair to taxpayers and service providers. Approval of Measure A would provide for
modern ordinance language to reflect the many changes in technology for providing
telecommunication services.

By treating all users of similar communication services the same, regardless of technology, it
is projected that Measure A will produce approximately the same amount of tax revenue, but
at a lower tax percentage.

The City of Tulare receives $1.4 million a year from its communications/cable tax for services
such as police protection, libraries, parks, recreation and senior programs. Support of
Measure A would ensure the continuance of this important revenue source.

Vote “Yes” on Measure A.
