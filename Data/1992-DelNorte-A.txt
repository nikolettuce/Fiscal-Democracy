<impartial> IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL

MEASURE A is a local ballot measure which proposes to raise the retail sales tax charged in Del Norte County by one-half of one-percent (1/2%). A YES
vote on this measure is a vote in favor of imposing an increase in the retail sales tax. A NO vote is a vote against the imposition of the increase in the retail
sales tax.

The increase in the sales tax will take place only if a majority of the voters approve of MEASURE A on November 3, 1992. If approved, MEASURE A will
impose the additional sales tax for a period of five (5) years, and no longer. MEASURE A imposes the sales tax increase in both the incorporated and
unincorporated areas of Del Norte County.

The money generated by the passage of MEASURE A will become general fund revenue of the County of Del Norte. The Board of Supervisors in a recent
resolution have stated that the increased general fund revenue will be used to fund essential county services such as the clean-up and closure of the Crescent
City landfill and dumpsite as required by State and Federal agencies.

If MEASURE A passes, effective July 1, 1993, County Ordinances 91-06 and 91-07, establishing and administering the $50.00 per unit solid waste fee
shall be repealed. <impartialend>
