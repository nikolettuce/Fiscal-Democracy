McCLOUD COMMUNITY SERVICES DISTRICT
MEASURE Q

RESOLUTION 07,2004

A RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING AN ELECTION TO LEVY AN
ADDITIONAL SPECIAL PARCEL TAX TO FINANCE
AMBULANCE SERVICES

WHEREAS, the McCloud Community Services District is
authorized by California Government Code 61600 et seq, and its
enabling legislation to provide ambulance services; and

WHEREAS, the voters in McCloud approved in a special election
dated June 3, 1997 a special tax in the amount of $64,32 per
developed single family residential parcel per year, with multiples
of the $64.32 tax rate charged for multi-family residential and
commercial properties to fund fire and ambulance services; and

WHEREAS, from 1997 to the present the District has utilized
approximately 50% of the existing fire and ambulance special tax
proceeds to fund fire protection and emergency response services
and 50% of the existing fire and ambulance special tax proceeds
to fund ambulance services, which is equivalent to an existing special
parcel tax rate of $32.16 to fund fire and emergency response
services and $32.16 to fund ambulance; and

WHEREAS, since implementation of the fire and ambulance
special tax in 1997, the expenses of operating the fire department,
emergency response and ambulance services have exceeded
revenues generated by the special tax in the amount of $14,136
in fiscal year 2001/02 and $24,984 in fiscal year 2002/03; and

WHEREAS, the President of the District Board of Directors
established a Long Range Planning Advisory Committee to evaluate
the long term operational and funding needs of the fire, emergency
response and ambulance services provided by the District. Said
committee completed its evaluation following one year of research;
its report and recommendations were approved and adopted by the
Board of Directors on March 22, 2004; and

WHEREAS, under direction from the District Board of Directors,
the Long Range Planning Advisory Committee evaluated various
funding mechanisms and tax structures and recommended as
follows: (1) that the Board of Directors seek voter approval for a
new special tax for fire and emergency services supplemental to
and in addition to the existing fire/ambulance special tax to fund
the additional costs of providing fire and emergency response
services, and (2) levy a new and separate special parcel tax for
ambulance services only. The committee also recommended
modifying the application of the new special tax to more closely
reflect the demand each property creates for such services and
adding an annual escalation factor in the rate of the special tax of
3% to ensure that the special tax revenue keeps up with the cost
of inflation; and

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the McCloud Community
Services District on July 12,2004, accepted and approved the special
tax recommendations of the Long Range Planning Advisory
Committee and hereby finds that levying a separate special parcel
tax for fire suppression and emergency services on the one hand
and a separate special tax measure for ambulance services on the
other hand will provide the public the maximum flexibility and
opportunity to decide the desired level of fire protection, emergency
response services and ambulance services. In addition, the Board
of Directors finds that an increase in special tax funding is required
to maintain the current level of ambulance services provided; and

WHEREAS, California Government Code Sections 53720 through
53730 and 53739 authorize the imposition of a special tax by a
local agency after voter approval pursuant to Article XIIIC and XIIID
of the California Constitution; and

WHEREAS, it is proposed that the new special tax be levied in
addition to the special tax approved by voters on June 3, 1997, at
varying rates depending upon the classification of each parcel of
real property subject to the special tax into Categories 0 through 6
described below. The application of these criteria results in the

assignment of Household Equivalents (HE) for each parcel of real
property subject to the special tax. The total new tax is calculated
by multiplying the HE rate as calculated for each property as set forth
below by the basic special tax rate for Category 1 of $31.00; and

WHEREAS, should the new ambulance service special tax be passed
by the voters on November 2, 2004, the total level of ambulance
taxation for a developed single family residential parcel will be as
follows; $32.16 (1997 special tax) plus $31.00 (Category 1,
ambulance special tax) equals $63.16.

WHEREAS, the original fire/ambulance special tax enacted by the
voters on June 3, 1997 shall remain in full force and effect; and

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Directors
of the McCloud Community Services District Board of Directors that
the following measure be placed on the ballot for vote in the general
election to be held on November 2, 2004 for a special tax to be
collected in the same manner and at the same time as ad valorem
property taxes are collected by the County of Siskiyou Auditor -
Controller - Tax Collector;

SHALL THE MCCLOUD COMMUNITY SERVICES DISTRICT LEVY
AN ADDITIONAL SPECIAL PARCEL TAX COMMENCING IN FISCAL
YEAR 2005-06 TO PROVIDE AMBULANCE SERVICES AT THE
RATES AND FOR THE LAND USE CATEGORIES SPECIFIED IN
RESOLUTION 07,2004, SUBJECT TO A FIXED ANNUAL INCREASE
OF THREE PERCENT (3%) PER YEAR?

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL
MEASURE"Q"

The McCloud Community Services District is proposing a special
tax to be submitted to the voters in the McCloud Community Services
District. The measure, if approved by two thirds of the electors
voting on the question, would authorize the McCloud Community
Services District to levy an additional special tax to be added to
each parcel and at rates depending upon the classification of each
parcel as defined in the resolution adopted by the Board of Directors
of the McCloud Community Services District on July 26, 2004. This
special tax is in addition to and does not replace previously approved
and levied taxes. If the measure is approved, commencing with
fiscal year 2005-2006, the amount of additional tax would be "$0"
for "undeveloped parcels"; Thirty One Dollars ($31.00) per year for
"single family residential”; Sixty Two Dollars ($62.00) per year for
"duplex or granny (residential)”; Thirty Eight Dollars ($38.00) per
year per dwelling for "multi-family residential”; Nineteen Dollars
($19.00) per year for "commercial and industrial (no living units or
rental rooms)"; Nineteen Dollars ($19.00) per year plus Thirty Eight
Dollars ($38.00) per year for "commercial with living units"; Nineteen
Dollars ($19.00) per year plus Thirty Eight Dollars ($38.00) per year
for each living unit plus One and 90/100 Dollars ($1.90) per year
for each rental room or RV space for "commercial with living units
and rental rooms and/or RV spaces." The special tax would be
subject to a fixed annual increase of three percent (3%) per year
after fiscal year 2005-2006.

If confirmed by the voters, the special tax would be levied effective
July 1, 2005. The tax would be collected at the same time and in
the same manner as ordinary County property taxes are collected
and would be subject to the same penalties and procedures in the
case of delinquency.

The special tax would be levied to establish a source of funds
so that the McCloud Community Services District could operate and
maintain ambulance services for the health, welfare and protection
of life within the McCloud Community Services District. The funds
could not be used for any other purposes.

A "yes" vote favors passage of the special tax; a "no" vote is
against the passage of the special tax.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE Q

McCloud volunteers, with the support of the McCloud Community
Services District, undertake many hours of training and make
themselves available to answer calls for ambulance services in the
McCloud area.

The Services District provides the volunteers with administrative
support, workers' compensation insurance, equipment, and other
miscellaneous items, as well as the building which houses the
ambulance. The 1997 tax measure, established to pay for the
Services District’s costs, was designed to cover expenses as they
existed at that time. Since then there have been substantial increases
in cost of living and especially workers’ compensation expenses
which the 1997 measure did not anticipate, leaving the District’s
ambulance services in a deficit situation.

The budget upon which the proposed new tax is based is a carefully
crafted, barebones estimate of expenses necessary for the continued
provision of ambulance services in McCloud. It provides for an
“ambulance replacement” fund, which will be a savings account to
be used toward buying a new vehicle, when it is needed many years
from now.

The undersigned respectfully urge the citizens of McCloud to
approve Measure Q and keep our ambulance services local and
ready to serve us.
