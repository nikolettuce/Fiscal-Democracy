<impartial> IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF COUNTY COUNSEL
ADVISORY VOTE ONLY MEASURE NO. V

•WOULD YOU SUPPORT A ONE-HALF PERCENT SALES
TAX. THAT WOULD RAISE APPROXIMATELY $162 MILLION
OVER A TWENTY-YEAR PERIOD, TO FUND TRANSPORTA-
TION PROJECTS IN THE LOCAL AREA, INCLUDING: THE
THIRD BRIDGE, SOUTH OF YUBA CITY AND MARYSVILLE.
BETWEEN HIGHWAYS 99 AND 70; THE MARYSVILLE BY-
PASS. ON HIGHWAY 70; AND A FOUR LANE EXPRESSWAY
FROM BOGUE ROAD TO LIVE OAK ON HIGHWAY 99 AND
OTHER LOCAL TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS TO BE SE-
LECTED BY THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND CITY
COUNCIL?

This measure is an advisory measure only which provides the
voters of Yuba County an opportunity to express their support or
lack of support tor a future imposition of a one-half percent sales
tax for certain local transportation projects and other local trans-
portation projects.

Since this measure is an advisory measure only, it is not binding.
Therefore, a 'yes’ vote on the question proposed by the measure
will not operate to legally require any action whatsoever. Likewise,
a ’no’ vote will not operate to prohibit any action whatsoever.

Should a half cent sales tax be imposed, it is estimated that,
over a 20 year period, approximately $162 million dollars would
be generated. <impartialend>
