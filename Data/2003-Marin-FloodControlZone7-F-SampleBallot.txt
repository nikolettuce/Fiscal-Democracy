ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE F

Much of Santa Venetia lies below higher tide levels. Water drainage
from storms and high tides needs to be pumped over levees into
Gallinas Creek. A well-functioning system of pumps and levees
(Santa Venetia Flood Control Master Plan) is critical to keeping
these waters out of our homes. This system is funded by Flood
Zone 7 taxes.

The Flood Control portion of our regular property taxes currently
provides only enough for minimal maintenance and repair of this
vital system. Additional funds are urgently needed to replace Pump
Station One. This measure proposes to re-establish a supplemental
tax to fund construction of a larger, more reliable and efficient Pump
Station.

Pump Station One is located on Vendola Drive between La Pasada
and La Brea. This station serves the largest drainage area in the
Flood Zone but is capable of handling only one third of the runoff
from a 25-year storm. For the past few winters a temporary yellow
pump has supplemented the station's capacity because the existing
station is unreliable. A complete replacement of Pump Station One
is necessary. Estimated costs well exceed the $1 million that our
Flood Zone 7 has accumulated in past years through careful
management of our capital reserve in preparation for this project.

Flood Zone 7 has pursued alternative funding from State, Federal
and County Government. While we’ve received some funding, other
possible sources have dried up in the current budget crisis.
Passing this tax measure is the most practical and reliable
source of funds for rebuilding Pump Station One. It also
increases our chances of obtaining government assistance in the
future.

Without a reliable flood control system, our homes become
vulnerable to flooding.
