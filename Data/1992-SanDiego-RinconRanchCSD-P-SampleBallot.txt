RINCON RANCH COMMUNITY SERVICE DISTRICT
Proposition P

P Shall the Rincon Ranch Community Services District be authorized to
establish and levy a special tax override, for a period of 5 years, on all
taxable real property within its boundaries for the purpose of providing
funds for repair and resurface of the roads maintained by the District, with
this special tax not to exceed five dollars and twenty cents ($5.20) per acre,
or portion thereof, plus one hundred fifty dollars ($150) per parcel of land
per year?

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION P

The Rincon Ranch Community Services District has proposed a proposition on the June Ballot to
provide the necessary funds to overlay the existing roads the district maintains. The roads are In
deplorable condition and will continue to deteriorate unless the required improvements are made.

The only revenues the district currently receives is a portion of the 1% general tax revenue,
approximately $7,500 annually which is barely enough for Insurance, required audit fees, county
tax collection fees, bookkeeping services with a minimal amount left over for road maintenance.

It Is imperative that we protect our Investment in our roads NOW! If we allow further deterioration
it will cost thousands more in the future.

We urge you to vote YES ON PROPOSITION P. Lets protect our roads and our property values.
JAMES G. SWENSEN	LORI JOHNSON

ARGUMENT AGAINST PROPOSITION P

POLL WORKERS AND FACILITIES NEEDED
=	MEET YOUR NEIGHBORS!	=

r	SERVE YOUR COMMUNITY!	®

There is a shortage of poll workers in many San Diego County
neighborhoods. Voters who are interested in this important work are
encouraged to apply by completing the application form. If you
apply immediately, it is possible that you could be assigned to work
at a polling place in the next election.

The Registrar is trying to build a permanent corps of poll workers;
therefore, homemakers and retired people, as well as others who
are interested in community service are particularly urged to apply.
The department also pays for the use of facilities to be used as a
polling place; i.e., home, clubhouse, business. Since the county
continues to grow and population centers shift, new polling places
are constantly needed.

You will receive a fee for your services.

Once this application is received you will be contacted by the
Registrar of Voters Office.
