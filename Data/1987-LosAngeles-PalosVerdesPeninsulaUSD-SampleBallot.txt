ANALYSIS OF THE BALLOT MEASURE
By De Will W. Clinton, County Counsel

Approval of this ballot measure would allow the Palos Verdes Peninsula
Unified School District to impose a special tax of up to $100 per year upon
each parcel of real property within the District. The tax would be for a
maximum five-year period. The precise amount of the tax would be determin-
ed each year by the Board of Education following a public hearing.

The taxes would be used to reduce class sizes, restore class periods at the
intermediate and high school levels, provide for staff development, replace
and add classroom instructional materials and equipment and perform major
maintenance needs of the District.

The ability of the District to spend this tax is subject to a State constitutional
ceiling on expenditures. Approval of this measure would raise this ceiling as
may be necessary to spend the proceeds of the taxes. The Constitution restricts
this raise in the ceiling to four (4) years, absent additional voter approval.

A two-thirds vote is required for passage of the measure.
