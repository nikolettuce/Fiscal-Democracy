Under Article XHICof the California Constitution, general law cities, such as the
City of Azusa, are authorized to impose new or increase existing general taxes, J
if a proposed new levy or increase is approved by a majority of the voters.	|

The passage of Measure F by a majority of voters in the City would enact
Ordinance No. 97-010. This ordinance authorizes the City to:

-	Increase the swap meet vendors admissions tax from Two Dollars ($2.00) to

Five Dollars ($5.00);	'

-	Increase the swap meet attendees admissions tax from Twenty-Five Cents

(.25c) to Fifty Cents (.50c); and	;

i

-	Establish a gross revenues business license tax on swap meet operators who »
currently only pay One Hundred Twenty-Five Dollar ($125.00) annual business
license tax.

The revenue from the increases and the various swap meet-related taxes will
generate approximately $124,000. This measure increases existing taxes and does
not establish new taxes. The proceeds from these taxes will go into the City’s
General Fund to replace revenues lost due to the impacts of Proposition 218. ITie
general tax revenue can be used to finance all types of general municipal services,
including, but not limited to, parks and recreation, library, senior citizen program,
building, planning, public works and emergency and safety services.

If approved, the measure will add the necessary authorizing provisions to the
Azusa Municipal Code. In the future, the tax rates can only be changed or |f
increased by a majority vote of the voters. However, the measure will authorize 1
the City Council to implement any necessary procedures for collection of the
taxes.

A “yes” vote on the Measure is a vote to approve and authorize the City to
•	increase the various swap meet-related taxes. A “no” vote is a vote against

increases in the swap meet-related taxes.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Ordinance No. 97-010. If you
desire a copy of the Ordinance, please call the City Clerk’s Office at (626) 812-
5229 and a copy will be mailed at no cost to you.	f

ARGUMEh If FAVOR ©F MEASURE F

We urge you to VOTE YES on the swap meet admissions and business license
taxes. An increase in these two taxes is an important part of the City’s plan to
make up a budget deficit of over $1.8 million caused by Proposition 218’s
invalidation of the City’s fire assessments.

In order to balance the City’s budget this year to make up for the unexpected loss
of the fire assessments, the City Council has initiated significant cost-cutting
measures, including: hiring freezes, cutting back community programs, delaying
i capital improvements, and reducing City Council salaries.

These cost-cutting measures coupled with additional revenue measures to replace
the lost fire assessment will allow the City to provide a reduced but acceptable
level of service in Library, Parks & Recreation, Senior Citizen, Building, Planning,
Public Works, and Police services. However, cost cutting alone is not sufficient.
We must create these alternative revenue sources before additional cut backs
Cause irreparable harm to the community.

We encourage you to VOTE YES on the swap meet tax measure. This tax will
be paid by the swap meet operator directly to the City. This measure will generate
approximately $124,000 annually in new revenue.

This tax will be paid only by those who attend the swap meet and those who sell
items at the swap meet. No other persons will be taxed under this measure.

We recommend a YES vote on all five of the Azusa revenue measures on this
ballot:

CRISTINA CRUZ-MADRID, Mayor
DIANE BEEBE, Mayor Pro-Tern
DAVE HARDISON, Councilmember
JOSEPH ROCHA, Councilmember
DICK STANFORD, Councilmember
