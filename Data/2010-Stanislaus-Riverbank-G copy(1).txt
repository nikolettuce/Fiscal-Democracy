BALLOT MEASURE/ QUESTION

Measure G: Shall an ordinance amending Section 34.47 of the
Code of the City of Riverbank, providing that "for the privilege of
occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject and shall pay a
tax in the amount of 9% of the rent charged by the operator", be
adopted? If Measure G passes the transient occupancy tax rate as

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY

MEASURE G

This ballot measure if adopted by a majority of city voters, would increase the tax
charged for the privilege of occupying a hotel room in the City of Riverbank from four percent
(4%) to nine percent (9%). The transient occupancy tax is a tax paid by hotel and motel guests
in the City. The tax is on the room rent paid. For example, a hotel guest would currently pay
$4.00 tax per night on a $100.00 hotel room. The revenue received by the City from this tax
would be placed in the general fund.
