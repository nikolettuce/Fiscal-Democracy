Under Article XHICof the California Constitution, general law cities, such as the
City of Azusa, are authorized to impose new or increase existing general taxes, J
if a proposed new levy or increase is approved by a majority of the voters.	|

The passage of Measure F by a majority of voters in the City would enact
Ordinance No. 97-010. This ordinance authorizes the City to:

-	Increase the swap meet vendors admissions tax from Two Dollars ($2.00) to

Five Dollars ($5.00);	'

-	Increase the swap meet attendees admissions tax from Twenty-Five Cents

(.25c) to Fifty Cents (.50c); and	;

i

-	Establish a gross revenues business license tax on swap meet operators who »
currently only pay One Hundred Twenty-Five Dollar ($125.00) annual business
license tax.

The revenue from the increases and the various swap meet-related taxes will
generate approximately $124,000. This measure increases existing taxes and does
not establish new taxes. The proceeds from these taxes will go into the City’s
General Fund to replace revenues lost due to the impacts of Proposition 218. ITie
general tax revenue can be used to finance all types of general municipal services,
including, but not limited to, parks and recreation, library, senior citizen program,
building, planning, public works and emergency and safety services.

If approved, the measure will add the necessary authorizing provisions to the
Azusa Municipal Code. In the future, the tax rates can only be changed or |f
increased by a majority vote of the voters. However, the measure will authorize 1
the City Council to implement any necessary procedures for collection of the
taxes.

A “yes” vote on the Measure is a vote to approve and authorize the City to
•	increase the various swap meet-related taxes. A “no” vote is a vote against

increases in the swap meet-related taxes.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Ordinance No. 97-010. If you

ARGUMEh If FAVOR ©F MEASURE F

We urge you to VOTE YES on the swap meet admissions and business license
taxes. An increase in these two taxes is an important part of the City’s plan to
make up a budget deficit of over $1.8 million caused by Proposition 218’s
invalidation of the City’s fire assessments.

In order to balance the City’s budget this year to make up for the unexpected loss
of the fire assessments, the City Council has initiated significant cost-cutting
measures, including: hiring freezes, cutting back community programs, delaying
i capital improvements, and reducing City Council salaries.

These cost-cutting measures coupled with additional revenue measures to replace
the lost fire assessment will allow the City to provide a reduced but acceptable
level of service in Library, Parks & Recreation, Senior Citizen, Building, Planning,
Public Works, and Police services. However, cost cutting alone is not sufficient.
We must create these alternative revenue sources before additional cut backs
Cause irreparable harm to the community.

We encourage you to VOTE YES on the swap meet tax measure. This tax will
be paid by the swap meet operator directly to the City. This measure will generate
approximately $124,000 annually in new revenue.

This tax will be paid only by those who attend the swap meet and those who sell
items at the swap meet. No other persons will be taxed under this measure.

We recommend a YES vote on all five of the Azusa revenue measures on this
ballot:

CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE G

Under Article X1IIC of the California Constitution, general law cities, such as the
City of Azusa, are authorized to impose new or increase existing general taxes,
if a proposed new levy or increase is approved by a majority of the voters.

The passage of Measure G by a majority of voters in the City would enact
Ordinance No. 97-011. This ordinance authorizes the City to increase the existing
general tax on rock, sand and gravel extraction operations conducted in the City.
If approved, the Ordinance will authorize the City Council to levy an extraction
tax in an amount up to $0.35 per ton of extracted rock.

The revenue from the increases in the rock, sand and gravel extraction tax will
generate approximately $950,000, if levied at the maximum amount. This measure
increases an existing tax and does not establish a new tax. The proceeds from this
tax will go into the City’s General Fund to replace revenues lost due to the impacts
of Proposition 218. The general tax revenue can be used to finance all types of
general municipal services, including, but not limited to, parks and recreation,
library, senior citizen program, building, planning, public works and emergency
and safety services.

If approved, the measure will add the necessary authorizing provisions to the
Azusa Municipal Code. In the future, the tax rates can only be changed or
increased beyond the $0.35 plus annual CPI by a majority vote of the voters.
However, the measure will authorize the City Council to implement any necessary
procedures for collection of the tax.

A “yes” vote is a vote to approve and authorize an increase in the rock, sand and
gravel tax. A “no” vote is a vote against an increase in the tax on rock, sand and
gravel businesses.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Ordinance No. 97-011. If you
desire a copy of the Ordinance, please callthe City Clerk’s office at (626) 812-
5229 and a copy will be mailed at no cost to you.

City Attorney
City of Azusa

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE G

Please VOTE YES on the rock quarrying tax measure. The City is facing a budget
deficit of over $1.8 million because of the loss of the fire assessment. By VOTING
YES to increase the tax on rock quarrying operations in the City, you will decrease
that deficit.

An increase in this tax will mean that the rock quarrying operators in the City
maybe taxed to a maximum of $0.35 on every ton of rock that is mined from within
the City of Azusa. This tax would place Azusa on a similar tax basis as many other
cities in Los Angeles County which tax rock quarrying.

In order to balance the City’s budget this year to make up for the unexpected loss
of the fire assessments, the City Council has initiated significant cost-cutting
measures, including: hiring freezes, cutting back community programs, delaying
capital improvements, and reducing City Council salaries.

These cost-cutting measures coupled with additional revenue measures to replace
the lost fire assessment will allow the City to provide a reduced but acceptable
level of service in Library, Parks & Recreation, Senior Citizen, Building, Planning,
Public Works, and Police services. However, cost cutting alone is not sufficient.
We must create these alternative revenue sources before additional cut backs
cause irreparable harm to the community.

If this measure is passed, it has the potential of generating approximately $956,000
annually in new revenue. This revenue will come directly from the rock quarrying
operators.

This tax will be paid only by the rock quarry operators. No other persons will be
taxed under this measure.

We recommend a YES vote on all five of the Azusa revenue measures on this
ballot:

CRISTINA CRUZ-MADRID, Mayor
DIANE BEEBE, Mayor Pro-Tern

Under Article XIIIC of the California Constitution, general law cities, such as the
City of Azusa, are authorized to impose new or increase existing general taxes,
if a proposed new levy' or increase is approved by a majority of the voters.

The passage of Measure H by a majority of voters in the City would enact
Ordinance No. 97-012. This ordinance authorizes the City to levy an additional
3% utility users tax on all users of telephone, electric, water and natural gas
sendees. The tax will, be collected on the utility provider’s utility bills and will be
payable by the utility users. The taxes collected by the utility providers will then
be remitted to the City.

The revenue from the utility users tax will generate approximately $840,000. This
measure will authorize an increase in an existing tax and does not establish a new
tax. The existing rules and regulations concerning the collection of the tax and
exemptions from the payment of the utility users tax will still apply. The proceeds
from these taxes will go into the City’s General Fund to replace revenues lost due
to the impacts of Proposition 218. The general tax revenue can be used to finance
all types of general municipal services, including, but not limited to, parks and
recreation, library, senior citizen program, building, planning, public works and
emergency and safety services.

If approved, the measure will add the necessary authorizing provisions to the
Azusa Municipal Code. In the future, the tax rates can only be changed or
increased by a majority vote of the voters. However, the measure will authorize
the City Council to implement any neccesary procedures for collection of the
taxes.

A “yes” vote will authorize the City to levy an additional 3% utility user tax. A
“no” vote is a vote against an increase in the tax.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Ordinance No. 97-012. If you
desire a copy of the Ordinance, please call the City Clerk’s office at (626) 812-

VOTING YES on the 3% utility users tax will provide a major step toward a
>alanced budget in Azusa. Seniors, handicapped, low income, schools, and
churches are exempted from this tax. However, this tax will apply to all other
utilities users, including businesses and renters.

in order to balance the City’s budget this year to make up for the unexpected loss
of the fire assessments, the City Council has initiated significant cost-cutting
measures, including: hiring freezes, cutting back community programs, delaying
capital improvements, and reducing City Council salaries.

These cost-cutting measures coupled with additional revenue measures to replace
the lost fire assessment will allow the City to provide a reduced but acceptable
level of service in Library, Parks & Recreation, Senior Citizen, Building, Planning,
Public Works, and Police services. However, cost cutting alone is not sufficient.
We must create these alternative revenue sources before additional cut backs
cause irreparable harm to the community.

If this measure passes, you will be authorizing a 3% increase in your utility tax.
In nearly all cases, the resulting utility users tax increase will be considerably less
than the amount you were paying for the fire assessment.

The old fire assessment for residences was $14.76 per month. The average
residential utility bill is $67. This proposed 3% utility tax, if approved, will be $2.01
per average residence.

If approved, the utility tax increase will generate approximately $840,000 annually
in new revenue.

This tax carries forward the existing exemptions for seniors, handicapped, low-
income, schools, and churches.

We recommend a YES vote on all five of the Azusa revenue measures on this
ballot:

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE I -------------------

Please VOTE YES on the landlords’ residential rental receipts tax measure.
Approval of this tax will mean that landlords will contribute revenue to the City
to help offset the costs that their rental operations have on the City. We must
all do our share to finance the municipal services that are provided with direct
charges to the users.

An increase in this tax will mean that residential rental property owners in the
city will pay up to an increase of $3.50 per $1,000 of residential property rental
receipts.

In order to balance the City’s budget this year to make up for the unexpected loss
of the fire assessments, the City Council has initiated significant cost-cutting
measures, including: hiring freezes, cutting back community programs, delaying
capital improvements, and reducing City Council salaries.

These cost-cutting measures coupled with additional revenue measures to replace
the lost fire assessment will allow the City to provide a reduced but acceptable
level of service in Library, Parks & Recreation, Senior Citizen, Building, Planning,
Public Works, and Police services. However, cost cutting alone is not sufficient.
We must create these alternative revenue sources before additional cut backs
cause irreparable harm to the community.

We urge you to VOTE YES on the residential rental tax! Approval of the
residential rental tax will generate approximately $96,000 annually.

This tax will be paid only by persons such as apartment owners who are landlords
to others who rent their residences. Owner occupied properties will not be affected
by this measure.

We recommend a YES vote on all five of the Azusa revenue measures on this
ballot:

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE J

Please VOTE YES on the commercial rental receipts tax measure. The City is
facing a budget deficit of over $1.8 million because of the loss of the fire
assessment. You can help the City recover from this loss by VOTING YES to
increase the tax on commercial rental property landlords whose property is in
Azusa.

An increase in this tax will mean that commercial rental property owners in the
city will pay up to a maximum increase of $8 per thousand dollars of commercial
property rental receipts.

In order to balance the City’s budget this year to make up for the unexpected loss
of the fire assessments, the City Council has initiated significant cost-cutting
measures, including: hiring freezes, cutting back community programs, delaying
