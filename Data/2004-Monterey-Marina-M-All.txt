CITY OF MARINA MEASURE M
RELATING TO IMPOSING
„ THE UTILITY USER'S TAX. WITH LIMITATIONS

• City of Marina Ballot Measure ,:M:; presents to the electors of
whether the City’s five percent;(5%) Utility User's Tax, with limitations-,
may be imposed by the. Council for, Jjmited periods expiring January

1, 2011.	'	'	. V.'

. , J,he.citizens of the,City of Marina,have previously, voted to; approve
extensions of the five percent (5%) tax on the use of utilities and
cable; television within the city. Although the Municipal Code still
contains, Ghaptep3;14 describing the tax, the authority. given by the
voters for the Council to impose the tax expired on August 1, 2004.
The City Council has now unanimously voted to place the matter of
whether the Council may impose the tax before the electorate, with
the following restrictions or conditions: a) the tax is not automatically
set at 5%, but can only be up to 5%, (and so can be less than 5%),
as specifically set by the City council; b) the Council’s action can
only be by a 4/5ths vote; c) after noticed public hearing(s); d) upon

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE M

Unless Measure "M” is passed, Marina will, be unable to maintain
current 'eve's of public,safety, maintenance, recreation and community
services we now enjoy. Cities continue to ;suffer financial difficulty
due to circumstances outside our control. California’s continued
retention of Ideal'revenue to balance the state budget, increased
fees for county services and the high cost of workers compensation
are eroding our financial base

Unlike some cities1 that are proposing to increase taxes, or add
new ones, Measure "M” only continues the existing Marina Utility
Users’ Tax at the current rate for a limited time. This financial crisis
should end when project developments on the former Fort Ord are
completed.	■	••

The City’s Economic Development Coordinator is facilitating the
revitalization of our Downtown. Businesses are relocating to Marina.
The Chamber of Commerce and city commissions are working with
staff to attract more businesses to support and augment our sales
tax base.

Transfer of the former Fort Ord land is ongoing. We anticipate
the City’s first new development, Marina Heights, will break ground
early next year, followed by Cypress Knolls, a senior housing
development and University Villages.

The need to maintain public services at satisfactory levels,
especially police and fire protection remains of great concern. The
UUT significantly funds these vital basic community services. In
order to ensure continuation of these basic services that the
community deserves, we need Measure “M".

The tact remains that the City needs time to bring the new
development projects on the former Fort Ord to completion. Measure
"M" will bridge the gap providing resources for the safe, self-sufficient
city where we can be proud to live, work and raise our families.

Your YES vote on Measure "M" is vital to continue our quality
of life in the City of Marina.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE M

,;The citizens of Marina have already given the city eleven.years
of this utility.tax. One wonders what the city has done, during these
eleven years to augment its tax base and justify .another :Six-;yearS
of this tax. 7;.»..■■■; -■ , ■■. ,cv of i i sssifcaH

The city claims the Economic Development Coordinator is
facilitating the revitalizatidn of our downtown, but the fact is. during
the eleven years of this utility tax period, the Coordinator position
with the city remained un-filled; hence, the K-Mart building remains
empty producing NO;sales,tax revenue.

The City argues The transfer of the former Fort Ord is ongoing,
but after ten years, the only projects even close to fruition is housing
- NOT job producing commercial enterprise! More than 200,000
square feet of warehousing with loading docks and railroad tracks
remain unused and no plans are being made to take advantage of
this windfall!

It is time for us to cut our losses and force the City to tighten
its belt. The city might start by requiring its high powered executives
to live in the city. Currently the Chief of Police is provided an expensive
SUV & mileage for weekend visits to his home in Sanger. One
wonders why the Police Chief chooses not to live here. What is the
saying? "It’s o.k. to visit Marina, but I wouldn’t want to live there!"

Vote NO on Measure "M"!

ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE M

ARGUMENT AGAINST CONTINUING MARINA UTILITY TAX

Fort Ord closed in 1993. Marina was faced with enlarging the
police and fire departments due to more area to be protected. The
City Council asked that a Utility Tax be imposed for two years, to
be reviewed only by the council in another two years. It was estimated
each family member would contribute $100 a year. Eleven years
later, the Council is asking to impose the tax at least up until the
end of 2010. The governor has promised to restore full funding to
municipalities in two years. Why keep Marina voters from having a
say on this tax again until 2011 ?

The present reason given for continuing this “temporary" tax is
to continue existing services. Since 1993, Marina has dramatically
increased it’s personnel hiring and retirement funding in all
departments; yet the Council has permanently frozen the impact fee
to the City to be paid by the new Marina Heights developers. Do
the developers have a stronger voice than the voters?

Marina residents have had increases in their property taxes,
water tax, and state park tax in just this year alone!

Since a large population of the city is retirees on limited incomes,
one might ask where we are to get the money to keep up with all
the taxes? We lose people because of the high price of housing.
Are we to lose people because it is too expensive for retirees to
live here? Increase in income is less than moderate for retirees.

Retirees have learned to do without and live within their incomes.
Should not the City do the same?

If you are tired of "business as usual" at the City Hall, Vote NO
on Measure M.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE M

The opponents to measure M make the following faulty
assumptions:

Their first incorrect assumption is that measure M is a tax
increase. That is incorrect; measure M is a continuation of the utility
user tax (UUT), which has been in place for many years.

Their second incorrect assumption is that the voters must wait
till 2011 to end the UUT. Actually the voters elect the city council
and as the citizens' representatives the council must reconfirm every
two years with a 4/5 yes vote to extend the UUT.

Their third incorrect assumption is that there is a relationship
between development fees and the general fund. In truth development
fees can only be applied to the costs incurred by the development.
They cannot be applied to the general fund for police and fire services,
nor can they be applied to general city services,

Their final point of protecting the senior citizens on fixed income
is also misleading. Since 57% of the general fund budget is used
for public safety, including paramedic and emergencies medical
services, critical to all Marina's citizens. Therefore an end to the
UUT with its corresponding 17% loss of revenues to the city will
have a serious negative impact on these vital services.

The argument in opposition provides no solution to the budget
crises brought on by state cuts and delayed development of former
Fort Ord property. Simply voting no is not a solution. Yes on Measure
M protects services and quality of life.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE «MP»

Unless Measure “M” is passed, Marina will be unable to maintain current levels of public
safety, maintenance, recreation and community services we now enjoy. Cities continue to
suffer financial difficulty due to circumstances outside our control. California’s continued
retention of local revenue to balance the state budget, increased fees for county services
and the high cost of workers compensation are eroding our financial base

Unlike some cities that are proposing to increase taxes, or add new ones. Measure “M”
only continues the existing Marina Utility Users’ Tax at the current rate for a limited
time. This financial crisis should end when project developments on the former Fort Grd
are completed.

The City’s Economic Development Coordinator is facilitating the revitalization of our
Downtown. Businesses are relocating to Marina. The Chamber of Commerce and city
commissions are working with staff to attract more businesses to support and augment
our sales tax base.

Transfer of the former Fort Ord land is ongoing. We anticipate the City’s first new
development, Marina Heights, will break ground early next year, followed by Cypress
Knolls, a senior housing development and University Villages.

The need to maintain public services at satisfactory levels, especially police and fire
protection remains of great concern. The UUT significantly funds these vital basic
community services. In order to ensure continuation of these basic services that the
community deserves, we need Measure “M”.

The fact remains that the City needs time to bring the new development projects on the
former Fort Ord to completion. Measure “M” will bridge the gap providing resources for
the safe, self-sufficient city where we can be proud to live, work and raise our families.

Your YES vote on Measure "M” is vital to continue our quality of life in the City of
Marina.

VOTERS GO TO POLLS NOVEMBER 2, 2004

UTILITY USERS’ TAX BALLOT MEASURE
“M” GOES TO VOTERS NOVEMBER 2, 2004

Marina residents will be going to the polls on
Tuesday, November 2, 2G04, to vote on ballot
measure “M” - Utility Users’ Tax (UUT). The City
has been asked certain questions by Marina
residents. What follows are common inquiries and
responses.

WHAT DOES MEASURE “M” SAY?

"May the City Council impose, for periods not to
exceed two years, the Utility Users' Tax pursuant to
Municipal Code Chapter 3.14, for general
government purposes, in an amount not to exceed
5%, after public hearing(s) and making written
findings that the funds are needed for basic public
safety, health, youth and senior citizens services?
"Tie tax may be overturned any time by subsequent
referendum vote and may not be imposed after
January 1, 2011."

WHAT IS THE UTILITY USERS’ TAX AND
HOW MUCH MONEY DOES IT GENERATE?

The UUT taxes the utility usage of the citizens and
of Marina. It is included on monthly utility bills;
telephone, electric, gas water and cable television.
The UUT generates approximately $100,000/month
or $1.2 million a year. This tax accounts for
approximately 13% of the City’s annual revenue.

HOW WILL THE MONEY BE SPENT? All the
proceeds from the UUT shall be placed in the City’s
general fund and used for the usual and current
expenses of the city.

IS THIS A NEW TAX? No. The City of Marina
has had a 5% UUT since 1994 when it was first
approved by the voters. The voters approved it
again in 1996 and in 1998.

WHY IS THE UUT ON THE BALLOT AGAIN?
he 1998 UUT ballot measure contained a sunset
clause, meaning that the measure automatically
terminated on August 1, 2004.

MasQiiro “RVT rnnfainc a ci tncot r-laucc. If

by the voters it will automatically terminate on
January 1, 2011. In addition the City Council is
required to consider the tax at duly noticed public
hearings in 2006 and 2008.

DO OTHER LOCAL CITIES HAVE A UUT?
Yes. The majority of area cities have a UUT. The
exceptions are Hollister, Carmel and Dei Ray Oaks.
No other area city’s UUT has a sunset clause.

HOW DOES MARINA'S EXPENDITURES
PER CAPITA COMPARE TO OTHER
CITIES?

Marina	$	391

Monterey	$1,434

Pacific Grove	$ 786

Seaside	$	421

WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF THE UUT DOES
NOT PASS? The adopted 2004-05 City of Marina
budget includes the loss of the UUT from August
through November (-$400,000), but assumes that
the UUT will be in place from December 2004
through June 2005 (+$800,000).

If the UUT doss not pass $800,000 worth of budget
cuts will have to be made by the City Council.

WHAT UTILITIES ARE SUBJECT TO THE
TAX? WHAT IF I CAN’T AFFORD IT? Gas,
electric, water, sanitation, cable TV and telephone
communication utilities are subject to the Utility
User’s Tax. Exemptions are available for low-
income households.

HOW IMPORTANT IS THE UTILITY USER’S
TAX? The Utility User’s Tax accounts for 13% of
the City’s General Fund revenues. About 64% of
the FY 2004-05 General Fund is spent for Public
Safety and City Recreation and Community
Services.

HOW IS THE ANNUAL CITY BUDGET
ORGANIZED? The City’s budget is divided into
numerous funds. The ’‘General Fund Group” is a
group of the primary operating funds used by the

City. AH other funds are special purpose funds
based on restricted revenues sources (such as Gas
Tax funds which may only be used for road
maintenance). Restricted funds cah only be used
/or the specified purpose; they cannot be
transferred to other funds for other purposes.

HAS THE UTILITY USER'S TAX
INCREASED? NO. The Utility User's Tax was
originally set at 5% and has never increased over
the time it has been in place. The City is proposing
to keep the Utility User's Tax at the same 5% as in
previous years. This is not a new tax nor tax
increase.

WHAT STAFFING HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY
THE LOSS OF THE UTILITY USER’S TAX?
Because the Utility User’s Tax ended in August
2004, the City was forced to freeze its hiring of
personnel paid by the General Fund. This hiring
freeze included 3 dedicated Fire Captain positions,
1 Fire Training and Prevention Manager; 1 Senior
Public Safety Officer; 2 Public Safety Records
Technicians, 1 Custodian for the Public Safety
Building, and 1 Public Safety Administrative
Secretary. It also included 3 additional fulltime
positions in the City's Public Works, Planning and
Administration Departments. By freezing these
positions, the City reduced its General Fund
operating budget by $708,000.

WHAT EQUIPMENT AND OPERATING
SUPPLIES HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THE
LOSS OF THE UTILITY USER’S TAX? In
addition to the hiring freeze currently in place, the
City also cut its operating expenses by an
additional $800,000 during the FY 2004-05 year.
These operating reductions affected all City
Departments.

HAVE MARINA VOTERS HISTORICALLY
SUPPORTED THE UTILITY USER’S TAX?

Yes. 54.5% of the voters said "Yes” to the Utility
User’s Tax in June 1994; 58.9% of the voters said
"Yes” to the Utility User’s Tax in June 1996, and;
61.5% of the voters said “Yes” to the Utility User’s
Tax in June 1998. Marina voters have historically
supported the Utility User’s Tax.

HOW HAS THE CITY WORKED AT
REDUCING COSTS IN PERSONNEL? The

City has been successful in partially reducing the
costs associated with its personnel paid for by the
General Fund by ensuring that any and all costs
associated directly with new development or within
special revenue funds such as Airport Enterprise
and Redevelopment are paid for by those
developments or funds. This helps to protect the
City’s General Fund while ensuring that costs are
appropriately charged where they are incurred.
