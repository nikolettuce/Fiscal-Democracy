Measure A: Sales Tax, City of El Cerrito

The El Cerrito Pothole Repair, Local Street Improvement and Maintenance Measure. To improve neighborhood streets; enhance road safety citywide by fixing potholes; maintaining, repairing and repaving streets; sealing cracks; improving handicap ramps, crosswalks, bicycle lanes; and maintaining road markings and signage, shall the City of El Cerrito incur debt to immediately begin and accelerate street improvements, paid by establishing a dedicated one-half cent sales tax used exclusively for street improvements, with citizens' oversight and independent audits of expenditure?

Impartial Analysis from City Attorney
Measure A, the El Cerrito Pothole Repair, Local Street Improvement and Maintenance Measure, would raise revenue to pay for street maintenance and improvements in the City of El Cerrito by authorizing a one-half percent transactions and use tax (commonly referred to as a "sales tax") within the City. The one-half percent tax would be paid in addition to current sales taxes. The new revenue measure has been approved by unanimous vote of the City Council; if approved by two-thirds of the voters, the tax would go into effect July 1, 2008.
Current State law permits cities to adopt additional sales and use taxes for special purposes. Measure A requires that the revenue raised be used only for the special purposes of "Street Maintenance and Improvements" as set forth in the Expenditure Plan that is a part of Measure A. Generally, "Street Maintenance and Improvements," for which Measure A funds could be spent by the City, include (a) repairs and other preparatory work necessary to prepare a street for resurfacing, including crack sealing, structural pavement repairs, leveling and rideability corrections, installation of curb ramps, and curb, gutter, and sidewalk repairs; (b) finish resurfacing, including installation of the final pavement surface and markings, pavement leveling, edge conform grinding, asphalt overlay, micropaving, slurry seal, and cape seal, and replacement and enhancement of pavement markings, striping, and signage; and (c) ongoing maintenance of the system in a manner to protect the City's street infrastructure; as well as related administrative costs. The City will annually prioritize the projects that the sales tax revenues will fund, to respond to the most significant maintenance and improvement needs.
In order to accelerate the schedule of street improvements, Measure A would also authorize the City to incur indebtedness in the form of bonds, notes, contractual obligations or other evidences of indebtedness to finance or refinance these costs. This indebtedness would be paid solely from the proceeds of the sales tax.
Measure A requires the City Council to appoint an independent Citizens Oversight Committee of five El Cerrito residents to monitor the expenditure of Measure A revenues and report to the People and the City Council. Members of the Oversight Committee cannot have conflicts of interest or benefit financially from Measure A revenues. The Measure also requires the City's independent auditors to complete and submit for public review an annual audit report. The audit report must review whether the sales tax revenues collected by the City are collected, managed and expended in accordance with the requirements of applicable law.
A "yes" vote on Measure A enacts the sales tax ordinance. It is estimated by the City's Finance Department that this measure will raise an additional $16.9 million in revenue for the City over a five-year period. A "no" vote will result in the tax not being adopted.

Arguments For Measure A
Repair and Maintain our El Cerrito Neighborhood Streets - Vote YES on A!
City and neighborhood streets are pitted with potholes and cracks. Maintaining the City's 68 miles of roads is important to El Cerrito's future. Repairing potholes and maintaining neighborhood streets are essential to our quality of life.
The El Cerrito Pothole Repair and Local Street Improvement and Maintenance Measure will allow the City to immediately begin and accelerate repair of residential streets.
YES on A to fix the streets now! This measure will repair and maintain neighborhood streets and keep repaired streets from deteriorating again.
YES on A for accountability! The money raised by the measure will be placed in a restricted fund and can only be used for street related repair and maintenance.
An independent citizen's oversight committee will provide financial oversight of funds authorized by the Measure to ensure proper spending of taxpayer money.
YES on A to fix residential streets!
95% of the money will be spent to repair and maintain neighborhood streets.
The streets that are in the worst shape will be repaired first. Under the proposed expenditure plan, over half of the basic repairs will be done in the first year and an estimated 75 percent of the streets will be completed within four years.
YES on A to repair the streets now so that they do not deteriorate further.
YES on A to fully fund El Cerrito's long-range street maintenance program.
Measure A costs just 5 cents on every $10 of sales. Prescription medications and grocery food are exempt. Visitors to El Cerrito also pay + not just residents.
Vote YES on A + fix El Cerrito streets.

Rebuttal to Arguments For
Street repair is necessary but Measure A is not. Measure A creates a gimmick that really enables the City to incur unstated levels of debt. Over half the basic street repairs can be done by simply reallocating $2.6 million from existing funds. Once streets are repaired, however, Measure A's half-cent sales tax will continue. The question is reasonably asked, "Where will the Measure A money REALLY GO?" Streets? Or bond fees, interest and even more bureaucracy, administrative salaries and lucrative benefits? Recent history suggests an answer.
While our streets steadily deteriorated, over the last four years the City's administrative costs grew as much as 173% and non-safety staffing grew as much as 180%! This tendency to increase bureaucracy at the expense of infrastructure and essential safety services is especially evident where the City's own budget plans an 80% decrease for streets by 2011.
In November, voters should be offered a pay-as-you-go sales tax alternative with guarantees to keep streets repaired without incurring debt. A half-cent sales tax increase for the general fund could provide $1.2 million annual revenue that pays for street repairs not bonds and provides the $1 million needed for annual maintenance.
Such information is not provided in the sound bite "Argument For" which tries to politically sell something that the City's own numbers dispute. Reject Measure A until reasonably asked fund allocation questions are backed up with clear commitments, iron clad guarantees, and sunset clauses. Vote NO!

Arguments Against Measure A
This "Pothole Measure" does NOT guarantee El Cerrito good quality streets. Instead, this Measure is nothing more than an immediate guarantee of record City debt and expanded City administrative payrolls. Keeping El Cerrito streets in good condition requires a Commitment that the City has been lacking. The "Pothole Measure" trades a half-cent sales tax for more debt cosigned by the El Cerrito taxpayer.
A "Yes" vote will merely increase City debt by $12 million. It's a "quick fix" that conveniently suggests improved streets for the next 10 years but Does Not Guarantee quality streets for El Cerrito residents. In the first two years the "Pothole Measure" could spend over $2 million of taxpayer money on financial administrative costs, interest and fee obligations resulting from the escalating indebtedness.
Instead of increased City debt, the City should effectively employ Redevelopment funding and a pay-as-you-go plan. The Agency was established in 1970 to cure blight. The biggest blight in El Cerrito is the condition of its streets. The Agency does not budget money for capital improvements of its streets and curbs (including disabled access), which precludes the City from complying with Federal requirements.
The City has allowed our streets to fail by diverting maintenance funding to excessive administrative salaries. Before voting for any tax measure, we deserve a guarantee from our City that our streets will be maintained in good condition, bring curbs up to Federal standards, and demand that the Redevelopment Agency pay its fair share.
Vote "NO" and, instead, demand that your taxes be spent on investing in the future of El Cerrito. Demand a pay-as-you-go street improvement plan that will guarantee quality streets, reduce blight, and avoid diversion of funds to escalating bureaucracy and excessive administrative staffing, salaries and benefits.

Rebuttal to Arguments Against
The opponent's argument is wrong. Don't be misled.
FACT: Every dime generated can only be spent on El Cerrito street repair and maintenance programs. ALL funds will be deposited into a separate, restricted Pothole Repair and Street Improvement and Maintenance Services Fund.
FACT: Without Measure A, El Cerrito doesn't have adequate dedicated funding to make significant repairs to neighborhood streets in poor condition, or maintain roads in good condition. In the next five years El Cerrito's average street rating will drop from fair to poor if neighborhood roads are not maintained. It is important to fix the streets now so that they don't deteriorate further.
FACT: El Cerrito is running as efficiently as possible, and making do with limited local resources. The City has spent available money to fix the streets, but it's not enough. Redevelopment Agency funds cannot be used to repair streets in residential neighborhoods. Doing a little each year will only make our streets more expensive to fix.
FACT: Measure A allows El Cerrito to immediately begin and accelerate repair of neighborhood streets.
FACT: Measure A costs just 5 cents on a $10 purchase--a small price to pay to fix the streets now. Measure A does NOT apply to purchases of grocery food or prescription medicine.
FACT: Measure A requires strict fiscal accountability, such as annual financial audits and an Independent Citizens' Oversight to ensure funds are spent as promised.
Measure A isn't about misleading voters, it's about fixing El Cerrito streets.
Vote Yes on Measure A.
