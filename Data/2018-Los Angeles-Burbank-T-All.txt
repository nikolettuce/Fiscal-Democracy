City of Burbank
City Attorney’s Impartial Analysis on Measure T
Adding Section 610A to the City of Burbank Charter

Measure T:

City Attorney’s Impartial Analysis:

If a majority of Burbank voters approve this measure, new Charter Section 61OA (“§610A”) will continue the existing
practice of including a fee in retail electric rates to fund the transfer of no more than 7% of Burbank Water and Power’s (BWP)
gross annual sales of electricity to the City’s General Fund in order to pay for essential City services.

In 1958, Burbank voters amended the Charter to allow this transfer (§610). For decades, retail electric rate payers funded
these transfers through a fee in rates with a percentage embedded in rates, a percentage as a line item to the rates or a
combination.

In 2016, Charter §610 was challenged in court. The court determined the fee is a tax, subject to Burbank voter approval;
and ordered the City to stop collecting the fee. City has appealed, which suspends the court’s order. Since the ruling,
BWP continues to collect the fee and make transfers to the General Fund. Council is placing transferred amounts into a
holding account, pending final resolution.

Although voters approved a Charter amendment to §610 in 2007, the court found voter-approval requirements for a tax
were not met because §610 did not explicitly authorize funding the transfers from retail electric rate payers.

City Council placed this Measure on the ballot to add Charter §610A -Utility Department Transfers- to resolve the court’s
ruling. §610A explicitly approves the existing practice of including a fee in retail electric rates to fund the transfers to the
General Fund as follows:

•	City Council is authorized to set retail electric rates annually that include the cost of transfers.

•	Burbank Water and Power is authorized to include the cost of transfers within retail electric rates or as a separate
line item fee.

•	Amount of the fee will not exceed 7%.

•	City Council may transfer up to 7% of BWP’s gross sales of electricity from retail electric rate payers to the City’s
General Fund.

•	Applies retroactively to the 2016/2017 fiscal year.

•	Authority to impose the fee will remain in effect until changed by the voters.

The estimated, annual revenue generated from the fee and transferred to the General Fund is approximately $12.5
million. Transferred amounts pay for fire, police, street repairs, street lighting, libraries, park/recreation programs/facilities.

A "no" vote means §610A is not approved and will not go into effect. Without passage of §610A and if City loses the court
appeal, the fee to fund the transfers must stop, resulting in no money to fund future transfers to the General Fund. A “no”
vote will likely result in a $12.5 million reduction in the General Fund, reflecting the annual revenue loss.

A “yes” vote adds §610A to the Charter continuing the long-standing funding mechanism for the approximately $12.5
million annual transfer to the General Fund. Passage of this Measure will not increase retail rate payers’ bills because
current rates already include the cost of the transfers. A “yes” vote results in continued funding of the General Fund
transfers, paying for essential City services.

Subject to Voter Approval	ORDINANCE NO. 18-3,904

AN ORDINANCE OF THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF
BURBANK IMPOSING THE “BURBANK INFRASTRUCTURE
AND COMMUNITY SERVICES PROTECTION
TRANSACTIONS AND USE TAX” TO BE ADMINISTERED BY
THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE
ADMINISTRATION SUBJECT TO ADOPTION BY THE
ELECTORATE

THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF BURBANK FINDS:

1.	The City of Burbank needs dependable and local sources of revenue to fund and
to support essential, necessary City services including such things as police, fire,
paramedic and emergency response, services for youth and seniors, public safety and
homeless programs, environmental and library programs, street and other infrastructure
repair and maintenance.

2.	Many residents live in the City of Burbank because it offers a higher level of
service, programs, and quality of life than in neighboring cities, and creating and
preserving local revenue sources will ensure that the City can maintain and improve the
quality of programs and services that residents desire and expect.

3.	The City is projecting an operating shortfall of about $9.5 million annually, even
though a) City voters approved Measure T in June 2018, which affirmed the City’s
practice of transferring up to 7% of Burbank Water and Power gross sales of electricity
to the City’s General Fund; and b) City Council and labor have initiated $9 million in
annual savings from other efficiencies.

4.	Besides an operating shortfall, the City also has unfunded infrastructure needs
for existing assets, such as deferred maintenance for streets, facilities, parks and storm
drains, of over $470 million. The City will need approximately $18 million annually just
to meet 75% of the unfunded infrastructure needs for our existing assets over the next
25 years.

5.	In total, the City is facing a funding shortfall of over $27 million annually to cover
operating and infrastructure costs. If the City does not add a new revenue source, the
Council will be faced with implementing significant cuts in all City services and the City’s
infrastructure deficit will only worsen.

6.	The City is proposing the Burbank Infrastructure and Community Services
Protection Transaction and Use Tax Measure, which in layman terms is referred to as a
sales tax, of three-quarter cent. This is estimated to generate $20 million dollars a year.
The revenue generated will cover the operating deficit and leave about $11 million
annually to begin addressing repairs and maintenance of existing City infrastructure
assets. Further, all revenue generated from this measure will be under local Burbank
control with 100% of proceeds being spent on Burbank services, programs and
infrastructure.

18-3,904

7.	If passed, the revenue generated will allow the City to meet its usual and current
expenses to provide necessary and vital services, as well as for the immediate
preservation of critical infrastructure for the public peace, health and safety of the City.
Based on all of the information provided, this is an emergency measure to preserve not
only the fiscal health of the City, but to preserve the quality of life of the City.

8.	All City revenues are subject to annual independent audits with public review of the
City Budget being widely available, including at City Hall, on-line and at the public
libraries. This proposed Ordinance will require the City Council to appoint a resident
oversight board who will make recommendations to the City Council on expenditure of
these revenues for infrastructure projects.

9.	The City of Burbank proposes to enact a three-quarter cent (3/40) transaction
and use tax as permitted by law.

10.	Under applicable law, to enact a transaction and use tax, the City Council of the
City of Burbank must adopt the transaction and use tax ordinance by a 2/3 vote and
the electorate of the City of Burbank must also adopt it upon majority vote at an election.

The Council of the City of Burbank does ordain as follows:

SECTION 1.

Commissions, and Committees (starting with §2-1-401)) or assign to an existing Board
or Commission generally the responsibility to advise the City Council on expenditure of
revenue generated from this Ordinance as recommended by City staff annually for
infrastructure projects. The mission of this new Board, in part, is to ensure the
reliability, maintenance and safety of the City’s infrastructure. As such, as part of the
annual budget process, after receiving and reviewing recommendations from City staff
on proposed funding for infrastructure projects, the oversight board will recommend
prioritization of the identified infrastructure needs and, at least on an annual basis,
review the status of funded projects. The City Council will appropriate revenue from
this Ordinance after a public hearing, which may be combined with other budget public
hearings.

2-4-2115:	SEVERABILITY:

circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the Ordinance and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.

2-4-2116:	EFFECTIVE DATE:

This Ordinance relates to the levying and collecting of the City transactions and use tax
and shall take effect immediately pursuant to Charter Section 500 and state law. In
accordance with applicable law, no tax imposed by this Ordinance shall take effect unless
this Ordinance is adopted by the electorate at an election to be held on November 6,2018.”

SECTION 2.

In order to further the purposes and intent of this Ordinance, the City Council is
authorized to amend Article 21 of Title 2, Chapter 4, Finance of the BMC in the
following areas without a further vote of the People:

A. Any change required by the State of California as a precondition to the
collection of the tax authorized hereunder. Notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary, any proposed change to the tax rate imposed under hereunder shall be
submitted to the vote of the People.

SECTION 3.

Any provisions of the Burbank Municipal Code or appendices thereto inconsistent with the
provisions of this Ordinance, to the extent of such inconsistencies and no further, is
hereby repealed or modified to that extent necessary to effect the provisions of this
Ordinance.
