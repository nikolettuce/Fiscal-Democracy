SUMMARY:

In March, 2001, the City held a General Municipal Election. Measure 01-A was placed on the
ballot to allow the City Council to adopt an Ordinance which imposes a 9% tax on persons
staying 30 days or less in hotels, motels and similar lodgings within the City. This measure was
presented to the voters in compliance with State Proposition 218 related to City taxing matters.
The measure requested the voters to approve the authorization of establishing a Transient
Occupancy Tax. Per Resolution No. 32-2001, certifying the election results, the voters approved
the Measure.

As a follow up to the approval of Measure 01-A, it is necessary to pass an ordinance to add the
approved Transient Occupancy Tax to the Municipal Code. Attached is the proposed Ordinance.

RECOMMENDATION:

It is recommended that the City Council conduct second reading, approve, read by title only and
waive further reading of Ordinance No. 468.
