(b)	Pursuant to the authority provided in Revenue and Taxation
Code section 7280, the County of Kern has enacted an ordinance entitled

<impartial> IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL
KERN COUNTY MEASURE E


The tax rate charged on hotel/motel room rental in the County’s unincorpo-
rated areas is now four percent (4%) lower than that charged in the County’s
largest cities of Ridgecrest and Bakersfield. A majority of voters voting “yes”
on this measure will authorize an increase from six percent (6% to ten
percent (10%) in the tax rate charged on room rental in hotels, motels and
similar establishments in the County’s unincorporated areas. Approval of this
measure will result in the same tax rate in the County’s largest cities and the
unincorporated areas.

Revenue generated from the increased tax will be deposited in the County’s
General Fund, which pays for various services which the County provides to
its residents. The tax is collected in a manner similar to sales taxes- that is
the operators of hotels, motels, inns, and similar establishments generally
collect the tax from persons who rent rooms for thirty (30) days or less The
amount collected is forwarded to the County.

California statutes authorize counties and cities to levy this charge which
is called a “transient occupancy tax”. This measure affects only the transient
occupancy tax rate charged in the unincorporated areas of the County Cities
have independent authority to set the tax rate charged in their respective
jurisdictions.

Proposition 62, adopted by the voters in 1986, requires voter approval of
any measure which proposes a new tax or a tax increase. Accordingly the
proposed increase in the transient occupancy tax rate from 6% to 10% will
not be effective unless it is approved by a majority vote of the electors voting
on this measure. <impartialend>











<favor> ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE E 

Approval of this measure will provide an efficient means for visitors and
travelers passing through Kern County to pay their fair share of the cost of the
local County services which they use. This will partially relieve Kern County
taxpayers of the burden of paying a disproportionate and unfair share of the
cost of County services which directly benefit pass-thru travelers out-of-
County visitors, and other transient motel/hotel users. County services which
benefit non-resident motel/hotel users include law enforcement, jails courts
fire response, emergency medical services, solid waste disposal, air pollution
control, public health services, parks, museums, and road construction/
maintenance. It is appropriate and consistent with the user-pay principle for
persons residing outside of our County who impact the cost of these services
to share in their cost. The proposed increase in the transient occupancy tax
which is applied to hotel/motel room charges, from 6% to 10% will generate
more than $550,000 annually for use in maintaining quality local County
Government services. The 6% transient occupancy tax currently in effect in
Kern’s unincorporated area is far below the rate charged in most other
California counties and cities, and is also below the 10% rate which is already
in effect within the City of Bakersfield. When Kern County citizens visit other
cities and counties, they frequently must pay a hotel/motel room tax of 10%,
or even more, to support local public services in those jurisdictions (City of
Los Angeles 12%, City of San Francisco 11%, City of Sacramento 10%). It is
only fair for Kern County to reciprocate, and for Kern County residents to
receive the same financial benefit and outside support enjoyed by the resi-
dents of those jurisdictions levying higher hotel/motel room tax rates A
yes ’ vote will indicate your support for correcting this inequity. <favorend>
