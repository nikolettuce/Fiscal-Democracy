CITY OF PARLIER
POLICE AND FIRE TAX MEASURE S

To maintain the current Parlier Police Department and Fire protection services , shall the
City of Parlier be authorized to levy a parcel tax as set forth in Council Resolution 2014-
44 for a period of 5 years and subject to an annual audit?

YES OR NO

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY

The Parlier City Council has placed Measure S on the ballot to ask the voters of Parlier if
the City should charge and collect a special tax on each parcel of taxable property within
the City for a 5-year period beginning July 1,2015 to support police department and fire
protection services in the City. If approved by 2/3 of the voters voting on the measure,
parcel taxes would be charged and collected at the following tax rates:

PARCEL DESCRIPTIONS*		TAXES/PARCEL/YEAR	
1	Single-Family Residential	$ 180.00 ($15.00/month)	* *
2	Commercial	$ 480.00 ($40/month)	* *
3	Industrial	$ 2400.00 ($200/month)	* *
4	Multi-Family Residential	$ 300.00 for 1st unit plus $100 for each additional unit	* *
5	Undeveloped Properties (City Lot = approx. 0.15 acres)	$ 300.00 per acre, up to maximum of $1200	**

* Taxable parcels only.

** Plus County Admin Fee, not to exceed $1.00/parcel

The parcel taxes would be collected by the County as part of the regular ad valorem
property tax bills, and be subject to the same collection process, interest and penalties
as ad valorem property taxes if not paid timely. The tax proceeds would be placed in
a special account and could only be expended to support police department and fire
protection services in the City. The City’s chief financial officer would be required to
make an annual report to the City Council on or before January 1 of each year that

explains (1) the amount of funds collected and expended under this special parcel tax
and (2) the services that were funded by this revenue.

A “yes” vote on Measure S approves the parcel taxes. It is estimated by the City that
this measure will raise an additional $425,000 in revenue for the City each year over its
5-year life. A “no” vote will result in the tax not being approved and charged.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure S. If you desire a copy of
the Measure, please call the Elections Official’s office at 559-600-8683 and a copy
will be mailed at no cost to you.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE S

Parlier needs Measure S to preserve the safety and quality of life for all residents. We
need our Law Enforcement and Fire Protection services. We need our police officers
for crime suppression and gang prevention. We need police patrols to protect our
neighborhoods, schools and parks. With the State Prison’s overcrowding problems, the
State is being forced to release criminals early from their prison sentences, which has
brought more crime and gang activity to our community. With the loss of redevelopment
and other local funds, the City has struggled to provide the public safety services the
community expects and needs. Measure S will provide a stable source of local funds
for public safety services that can’t be taken by the State. Without the funds from
Measure S, we may once again have to disband our police our police department and
rely on the Sheriff’s Department for our law enforcement protection. Parlier voters have
a choice - preserve our police services, or watch crime and gangs increase. Help
make Parlier the safe community we deserve - choose local police services. Vote
YES on Measure S.

RESOLUTION NO. 2016-29A

A RESOLUTION OF THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF
PARLIER AUTHORIZING A SPECIAL PARCEL TAX FOR POLICE
PROTECTION SERVICES TO BE DESIGNATED AS MEASURE
TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE VOTERS ON NOVEMBER 8, 2016

WHEREAS, the City of Parlier has experienced, and continues to face, a dramatic critical
decline in revenues and has reached a point where cutting expenses will not allow the City to
ease the structural deficit without further cutting essential City services; and

WHEREAS, this unprecedented financial situation is due to several factors, including the
declining total revenues for the City's General Fund and increasing general expenses to the
City such as the rising costs of fuel, electricity and supplies. This has made it impossible for
the City to balance its budget and still continue to provide critical services at an acceptable
level; and

WHEREAS, in order to address the imminent shortfall of an unacceptable magnitude, the
City has already negotiated certain position cuts and benefit reductions with the Police
Officers Association; and

WHEREAS, unless it is able to increase its revenues, the City would have to include further
cuts to public safety and other critical City services as a last resort; and

WHEREAS, because citizens of Parlier have expressed a strong desire to maintain public
safety as a top priority, the City is proposing a solution that would help maintain these
important services; and

WHEREAS, the City Council desires to adopt Ordinance No. 2016-03 to impose a special
parcel tax for police protection services, subject to a two-thirds majority voter approval, as
required by Cal. Const., art. XIIID, § 3(2) and as allowed by Government Code Section 53978;

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED AND ORDERED by the City Council of the City of
Parlier as follows:

SECTION 1: The City Council submits to the voters of the City of Parlier at its next regular
municipal election to be held on November 8, 2016, a ballot measure for consideration of an
ordinance for establishment of a Special Parcel Tax for Police Protection Services.

SECTION 2: The City Council requests the Fresno County Board of Supervisors that the
election for this measure be consolidated with the statewide election also to be held on
November 8, 2016.

SECTION 3: The question to be submitted to the voters with respect to the ballot measure
shall be printed on the election ballot in the form set forth as follows:

To support local police services; maintain emergency response times and

a special parcel tax for police protection services only of $120.00 on each	YES
single-family home, and specified amounts for multi-family units; mobile	
home spaces; commercial, agricultural, and industrial parcels, as outlined in	
Ordinance No. 2016-03, providing an estimated $495,000 annually for five	TAX-
years, with independent annual audits, and benefiting City residents?	NO

SECTION 4: The following constitutes the synopsis of the measure to be voted on for
purposes of meeting the publication requirements of Election Code Section 12111:

Notice is hereby given that the following measure is to be voted on at the general
municipal election to be held in the City of Parlier, on Tuesday, the 8th day of
November, 2016.

ADOPTION OF ORDINANCE APPROVING A SPECIAL PARCEL

TAX FOR POLICE PROTECTION SERVICES

establishing a special parcel tax to pay only for local police protection services for a
period of five years. If approved by a two-thirds majority of voters, the ordinance
would impose a tax in the amount of one hundred and twenty dollars ($120.00) on
each single-family residential parcel and each agricultural parcel, ninety-five dollars
($95.00) per unit on each multi-family residential parcel, nine hundred seventy five
dollars ($975.00) on each commercial parcel, twelve hundred dollars ($1200.00) on
each industrial parcel, and one hundred dollars ($100.00) per space on each mobile

an oversight committee.
