MEASURE U
TOWN OF YUCCA VALLEY

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS FOR MEASURE U

This Impartial Analysis for Measure U has been prepared by the Town
Attorney pursuant to Section 9280 of the Elections Code of the State of
California.

The Town of Yucca Valley Council has placed Measure U on the ballot, which
would approve an ordinance enacting a one cent (10) transactions and use (sales) tax
within the city limits of the Town of Yucca Valley. If Measure U is approved by the
voters, some of the local services and programs that may receive funding include:
sewer system financing and implementation, 9-1-1 response, neighborhood police
patrols, streets and other general municipal services.

Measure U revenues would be legally deposited into the Town’s General
Fund and are protected from the State pursuant to law. All Measure U funds are
required to be spent locally for Yucca Valley services. Measure U would last for a
period of thirty (30) years.

Visitors to the Town of Yucca Valley, as well as residents, would pay the
sales tax. Consistent with State law, Measure U is not applied to prescription
medication or food purchased as groceries. Measure U is subject to annual
independent audits by an independent citizen-based committee.

If Measure U is adopted, the Yucca Valley sales tax rate would go from the
current rate 7.75% to 8.75%. If adopted, the one cent (10) transactions and use
(sales) tax would be effective April, 2013.

To be adopted, State law requires that this Measure be approved by a
majority (50%) of the Town’s voters.

A “Yes” vote on Measure U would adopt the ordinance implementing a one
cent (10) transactions and use (sales) tax rate in Yucca Valley.

A “No” vote would not adopt the ordinance implementing a one cent (10)
transactions and use (sales) tax rate in Yucca Valley.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure U. If you desire a copy
of the ordinance or measure, please call the Yucca Valley Town Clerk’s Office at
(760) 369-7209 Ext. 226 and a copy will be mailed at no cost to you or go to

Do something about it! Vote YES on U to ensure local control for Yucca Valley.

The State has ordered Yucca Valley to convert to a centralized sewer system by 2016

community priorities.

REBUTTAL TO THE ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE U

This Rebuttal to Argument in Favor of Measure U was submitted pursuant

opinion of the author(s), and has been printed exactly as submitted.

Tired of Sky Harbor running our town... and recklessly spending your money?

Do something about it! Vote NO on U to ensure economic justice in Yucca Valley!

The Town Manager and Council are using the wastewater crisis to enact an excessive
and long-standing tax. Measure U was put on the ballot without any provisions to pay
for a wastewater treatment system—not the plant, the sewers, or the connections. NO
on U will prevent the Town Manager from taking advantage of our wastewater crisis to
fund unnecessary projects, hire expensive out-of-town consultants, and raise staff
salaries.

NO on U will stop the Town Manager’s spending spree!

NO on U will give true local control of money—to you!

Join local businesses, seniors, workers, and students to oppose a tax that shifts
money from the poor to the wealthy. Join Republicans, Democrats, Tea Partiers, and
Occupiers to oppose a measure that benefits only its proponents.

The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association has stated that sales taxes like Measure U
are regressive—meaning they disproportionately impact those on low or modest
incomes. The American Association of Retired People (AARP) informs its members
about the unfair burden sales taxes put on those living on fixed incomes. Why does
Measure U have a “taxpayer advocate” and “senior advocates” supporting a measure
that so severely hurts the very people they claim to represent?

Vote NO on U and support efforts towards direct and fair sewer financing.

ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE U

This Argument Against Measure U was submitted pursuant to Section 9282
of the Elections Code of the State of California. It is the opinion of the
author (s)9 and has been printed exactly as submitted.

Measure U costs everyone. It will cost residents more to buy from local businesses
and, to stay competitive, some local businesses will be forced to absorb the cost of the
tax. All taxable goods - from gasoline, tires, and cars to diapers, clothes,
homebuilding supplies and even fast food - will see a substantial increase in the sales
tax charged (while the tax rate increases by 1% of an item’s cost, this is almost a 13%
increase in the amount of sales tax charged); and for this we have no guarantee that
any of the projected additional tax of up to $160 million will be used to fund the sewer
project because the funds are going into the town’s general coffers.

Don’t be fooled. Non-residents will only generate the estimated increase in sales tax
revenues if they don’t care about higher local prices. Local residents may stop buying
gasoline locally and buy it in Joshua Tree or Morongo Valley. Our Measure I revenues
that are already earmarked for road and transportation projects may fall as a result.

While the assessed sewer cost to property owners may fall, the actual cost to property
owners is unclear as prices rise and local businesses are less competitive. If this tax
passes, it locks Yucca Valley into a 30-year uncompetitive tax structure for another
generation, and transfers money from the pockets of struggling families and
businesses into the hands of government.

Vote “NO” on Measure U now and send it back to the Town Council to come up with a
specific plan, a transparent analysis, and a grass-roots solution that works for
everyone.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE U

This Rebuttal to Argument Against Measure U was submitted pursuant to
Section 9285 of the Elections Code of the State of California. It is the
opinion of the author(s), and has been printed exactly as submitted.

The fact is, Yucca Valley is under assault from Sacramento politicians and their never-
ending money grabs and regulations.

Should we just wring our hands and continue to take this abuse? Absolutely not! Join
the Yucca Valley Chamber of Commerce and your neighbors in voting YES on U to
protect our services and property values!

FACT: YES on U gives Yucca Valley LOCAL CONTROL over our taxpayer dollars, to
address OUR needs. By law, this money can’t be seized by Sacramento politicians.

FACT: Sacramento has ordered us to develop a centralized sewer system by 2016 -
or face significant penalties and fines. YES on U helps fund the wastewater treatment
plant and collection system - reducing costs for Yucca Valley taxpayers by at least
35% by lowering costs to connect to the sewer system.

FACT: YES on U maintains neighborhood police patrols, 911 response, and narcotics
enforcement while maintaining and repairing existing neighborhood streets and alleys.

FACT: YES on U is Financially Accountable and requires an Independent Taxpayers’
Oversight Committee, mandatory financial audits, and annual community reports to
ensure funds are spent as promised.

FACT: Out-of-town shoppers help pay these costs. Measure U is NOT applied to
food purchased as groceries, or prescription medication.

Longtime Yucca Valley residents, taxpayers and local business all agree that YES on
U is a responsible plan to ensure local control over local funds, protecting our property
values.

Other neighboring communities have passed similar measures to successfully take
control and help themselves. Join us in Voting YES on U.
