COUNTY COUNSEL’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
OF MEASURE I

COUNTY SERVICE AREA NO. 19
SPECIAL TAX FOR PARAMEDIC SERVICES
MEASURE I

If this measure is approved by a two-thirds vote, for
County Service Area No. 19, Ordinance No. 3459, increas-
ing the special tax to continue emergency paramedic ser-
vices effective July 1, 2007, in an amount not to exceed
eighty five dollars ($85.00) per year for each living unit,
and a maximum of eleven cents ($0.11) per square foot for
each non-residential structure, shall become effective.
Dated: August 24, 2006

County Counsel

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE I

This Measure increases an assessment begun in 1980, to
provide paramedic services. Approval must be by two-
thirds of those voting, every four years.

Our County Service Area No. 19 contracts with the San
Rafael City Fire Department to provide us in the unincor-
porated area with emergency medical response.

This Measure does two things: (1) it increases the maxi-
mum annual assessment from the current $61 to $85 for
each household, and (2) increases the maximum tax, per
square foot for each non-residential structure, from the
current $.08 to $.11 per square foot.

For the past four years, the maximum rate per household
was $61. In order to account for future cost increases, this
Measure provides the authority to increase the maximum
amount to $85.00 over four years. The actual rate is set by
the Board of Supervisors annually, determined by actual
costs, in negotiation with the City. The cost of service is
determined by the number of households and commercial
properties in the unincorporated area surrounding San
Rafael.

We urge your “YES” vote to insure we continue to receive
this vital, life-saving service. If a resident of C.S.A. 19
called a private ambulance company for transportation to
Marin General Hospital, the Basic Life Support charge
would be hundreds of dollars, plus supplies and mileage
charges. Considering these costs, we feel the life-saving
service we receive from this Measure is a real bargain.

If this Measure does not pass, the City of San Rafael can
terminate paramedic service to our community.

WE STRONGLY URGE YOU TO VOTE “YES” TO
MAINTAIN THIS CRITICAL SERVICE.
