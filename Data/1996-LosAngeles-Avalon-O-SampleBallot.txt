CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF PROPOSITION O

In 1956, Avalon voters enacted by initiative an ordinance that requires all business
license taxes collected by the City to be turned over to the Chamber of Commerce,
to be used for promotion and marketing. In 1995-96, the Chamber of Commerce
received $81,585 in business license taxes. The Chamber of Commerce also
receives 22% of all transient occupancy taxes collected by the City pursuant to
an ordinance adopted by the City Council in 1994. In 1995-96, the Chamber of
Commerce received $331,216 from transient occupancy taxes. If Measure O is
approved, all business license tax revenue will go into the City’s General Services
fund rather than to the Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber of Commerce
would continue to receive 22% of transient occupancy taxes. If both Measure O
and Measure P receive more than 50% “Yes” votes, then the measure receiving
the most “Yes” votes will be adopted.
