Measure E
May 3, 2005

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF

Help us help you. Your officers of the Cosumnes River Community Services District want to
properly maintain and improve the district roads. If we can maintain or improve your road in a
first-class manner, the value of your property will increase. Conversely, shoddy roads will
decrease property values, not to mention the decreased safety and aesthetic qualities of such
poor roads. The quality of the roads has been steadily improving over the years, but if we
cannot adequately maintain the high standards we have achieved, all the work put into
maintenance and improvement will have been in vain.

The current $150.00 parcel tax for the district roads is comparatively small. This amount
dates back to 1991. In the 14 years since then road maintenance and improvement costs
have increased significantly, with a proportionate reduction in our ability to maintain and
improve your roads. Insurance rates have about doubled, and we expect a large increase
next year. We are asking for an increase of $75 for fiscal year 2005-2006, plus an annual
increase of $15 per year for the succeeding five years.

We have a total of 13 miles of roads in the District, of which 6 miles have been hard surfaced,
and the balance graveled. Our budget is approximately $34,000 per year, which includes (1)
administrative costs, e.g. insurance, port-a-potty, maintenance of park benches and
miscellaneous expenses; (2) maintenance of both surfaced and graveled roads; (3) new
surfacing (chip seal). Under the current budget, we would fail in our basic responsibilities of
maintaining the quality of and improving your roads. You would not reach the potential of
your real estate investment.

A 2/3-majority approval by registered district voters is required for an increase in the parcel
tax. We ask you to support the increase.
