ANALYSIS OF PROPOSITION A
By Oe Witt W. Clinton, County Counsel

This ballot measure would allow the South Pasadena Unified School District
to levy a special tax of S98 on each parcel of land within the District with
proceeds to be used for educational purposes. The special tax would be limited
to a period of five (5) years.

Proceeds of the tax are to be used for any of the following purposes: to
improve classroom instruction, acquire library books and text books, attract
and retain teachers and provide drug education programs.

The amount of the tax is S98 per parcel per year, but would be reduced if
necessary to prevent a loss in funds from local, state or federal sources.

Adoption of this measure would increase the appropriation limit of the
District. Under the Constitution the increase in the appropriation limit would
expire after four (4) years unless a continuation of the increase was again
approved by the voters in a subsequent election.

The measure requires a two-thirds (2/3) vote for passage.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION A

Life in South Pasadena offers many pleasures, and many features of which
residents can be proud. For many years, our public school system has been one of
the main factors making our community such a great place to live and raise a
family.

Those of us without children in school have enjoyed the advantages of a great
school system as well. A major reason for our healthy property values has been
the quality of our schools.

But in recent years, economic realities have hit South Pasadena. As in
communities across California, South Pasadena schools arc feeling the effects of
the budget crunch. This funding crisis is affecting the most basic educational
programs and services our children will need to survive and thrive.

Proposition A is a common sense way to help South Pasadena schools meet the
challenge of educating students for the 1990’s and beyond. Proposition A is fair,
economical and deserves a YES vote.

By voting YES on Proposition A, you will be making a statement about the
quality of life in our community...and the importance of maintaining and enhan-
cing basic education. Your YES vote on Proposition A provides funds for
teachers and students, improving classroom instruction, particularly in math,
science, reading and writing.

Proposition A provides funds to acquire up to date textbooks and library books,
buy computer and science equipment, provide drug education programs and
reduce class size. This money will not be spent on administration.

We are proud of our community. All South Pasadenans benefit from better
public schools. Your YES vote on Proposition A is a vote to keep our City
moving ahead.

That is why School Board Members Margaret Ann Abdalla, Ellen Hervey, Susan
LaCombe, Yvonne Pine and Joan Sturkie unanimously join us in urging you to
VOTE YES ON A.
