ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE “B”

Wildomar Benefit Assessment District AD 68-4632

Would you keep paying for tickets to a show no longer playing at a
theater being torn down? Would you continue paying for clothes no one
will ever wear or paying for meals nobody ever gets to eat? Probably not,
what would be the point! Continuing to pay this property assessment
every year amounts to the same thing. It is identified on your property tax
bill as the “Wildomar Benefit Assessment” AD 68-4632 and was levied
on homes and properties in Wildomar, including the Farm, without a vote
of the people, by the Ortega Trail Recreational and Park District
(OTRPD) in 1992. OTRPD was to purchase and provide a community
park complete with a two-story community center, gym, swimming pool,
etc. Little of this ever happened. OTRPD was the agency receiving this
assessment and obligated to provide the park and services. On June 30,
1999 OTRPD board of directors voted 3-2 to close Wildomar Community
Park (Marna O’Brian Park), ceasing all operations and maintenance
there and throughout the district. In July of 1999 Ortega’s board unani-
mously voted to dissolve OTRPD. The dissolution was approved by
Riverside County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) on
Dec. 9,1999. The district IS being dissolved, its assets liquidated. All
facilities are closed. No benefit to Wildomar or any community is likely to
ever appear. This assessment constitutes a LIEN against your property
in the form of a Property Tax for the next sixteen years if approved. There
is NO district, NO park, NO services, NO benefit. There should be NO
assessment!
