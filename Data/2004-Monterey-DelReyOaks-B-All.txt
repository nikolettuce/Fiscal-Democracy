ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE B

The Del Rey Oaks City Council has again placed the Public
Safety Tax, (Measure B), on the ballot. This time it is for three years
as contrasted to five years. Measure B was defeated last November,
by a mere 16 votes. With such a close margin, the City Council feels
it must re-submit the Measure to the voters. The tax is an absolute
necessity for the City to maintain its level of police and fire services.

The City Council continues searching for additional revenues.
The Stone Creek Shopping Center continues to increase the City
sales tax revenues; but, this project was never intended to be the
complete solution to our budget shortfall. It was only one step toward
financial self sufficiency.

We expect that the Army will transfer the 360 acres of the former
Fort Ord early in 2004. Unfortunately, the transfer has been delayed
by the clean-up of unexploded ordnance and by bureaucratic detail.

Del Rey Oaks continues to provide you with your own outstanding
police department and fire service. Measure B must be passed in
order to maintain the quality of services you now enjoy.

This financial crisis will not end until projected commercial
developments at the former Fort Ord are completed, probably within
three to six years. In the meantime, Measure B will allow the City
to continue your fine police protection and fire service. Our goals
are to keep Del Rey Oaks safe and to become financially self-
sufficient. It’s a wonderful place to live and raise our families.

Vote YES on Measure B.
