IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE E
BY COUNTY COUNSEL

STONES-BENGARD COMMUNITY SERVICES DISTRICT
SPECIAL TAX MEASURE E

This measure would authorize Stones-Bengard Community Services District
to assess a special property tax against all taxable real property in the district
based upon the use of the property, for fire suppression, prevention,
emergency medical services and for the maintenance, equipping and housing
the volunteer fire department. Said rates would be in the following amounts:

Unimproved

Improved

(other than Commercial or Industrial)

Improved Multi - Family Residential

$105.00 per parcel

$150.00 per residential unit
plus $15.00 for each
accessory or detached
building, per parcel
$150.00 per unit, per parcel

Improved Commercial and Industrial	$300.00	per	parcel

RV Parks & Campgrounds	$300	base	fee plus $5 for each

RV and/or Campground space

The measure will also authorize an increase in the District's
spending limits to the extent that the revenues generated by this measure are
in excess of the limits in existence prior to the election

The special property taxes shall be collected in the same manner
and subject to the same penalties as County Property taxes are collected. In
the alternative, the Board of Directors may provide for the taxes to be billed
separately and individually to some or all of the property owners whose
property is subject to payment of the special tax.

Upon the favorable vote of two-thirds of the voters voting upon the
measure the existing tax rates will be repealed and the new special property
tax will become effective. In the event the measure does not receive the
requisite votes to pass, the existing tax rates will not change.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE E

Due to a recent medical emergency it was necessary for me to call an
ambulance. Within a very few minutes a California Division of Forestry crew
was at my door as the first responders. They immediately began monitoring
my vital signs and administrating to my needs. This crew responded from the
Grasshopper Fire Station to my home in Bucks Bay.

Our volunteer Fire Department is currently operating with a small number of
volunteers. We feel our Community needs better service than we can give at
this time. To provide this additional service it will increase our fire assessment
for improved property with one residence to forty-four cents per day, with two
residences to ninety-two cents per day and unimproved property to
twenty-eight cents per day.

In my opinion the Amador Plan that we are being offered which would keep
Grasshopper Fire Station open all year instead of only during the fire season
is our only feasible way to have well trained professional fire fighters and
emergency medical technicians to help our volunteer firemen serve our
community. If you want to do something to help, now is the time to act and
vote yes on Special Tax Measure E.

KATHY WATERS
Director

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF
MEASURE E

The California Dept, of Forestry (CDF), Grasshopper fire station, is located
seven miles from Bucks Bay; Spalding Volunteer Fire Department (VFD) is
also located seven miles from Bucks Bay, giving them about the same
response time. CDF does not have an ambulance; Spalding VFD does have
a fully-equipped ambulance. Had it been necessary to transport anyone to
the hospital in Susanville, CDF would not have had the proper vehicle to do
so.

Forty-four cents a day amounts to over $160.00 a year, three times higher
than you have been paying. This figure is for an "improved" parcel, perhaps
one with just a road.

The argument for Measure E leads you to believe that Grasshopper would be
fully staffed during the winter months, as it is in the fire season. This is not
true; there would be just a skeleton crew of two men in the winter months.
Keeping Grasshopper open (The Amador Plan) all year is not the only way to
have certified fire fighters and medically-trained personnel available all year.
For years Spalding VFD, with nine California State certified firemen and three
certified medically-trained personnel has been responding to emergency calls
from the Stones-Bengard and Bucks Bay Communities.

My statements regarding fire assessment fees can be verified by SBCSD
Resolution 02-02. Request a copy from the Secretary of the Community

Service District.

Vote NO on Measure E. The Amador Plan is not needed and is too costly.
LOIS SCHULZ

ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE E

Vote no on Measure E.

This measure will repeal the existing fire tax and replace it with a special tax
300% higher. If this measure passes, an improved parcel will be taxed at
$150.00 a year; each additional building wiil cost another $15.00 a year: an
unimproved parcel will cost $105.00 per year. This tax will be permanent
unless repealed.

The proposed assessment method is not equitable. No distinction is made
between an Improved” parcel with just a road or a 5,000 square foot house.
No distinction is made between an “unimproved" parcel of one acre or twenty
acres.

This tax is not needed. The SBCSD Board is asking for the additional money
to implement the Amador Plan, which utilizes the services of CDF. Two men
would be stationed at Grasshopper Fire Station from November 1s! to May
31st, when the fire danger and need for medical services are at its lowest.
Stones-Bengard already has a mutual agreement with the Spalding V.F.D.
Spalding has nine volunteer fireman, all certified; three medically trained
personnel, all certified; two fire trucks, two tankers, and an ambulance.

There is a surplus of $52,000.00 in the fire fund. If the SBCSD Board feels
the Amador Plan is absolutely necessary, there is enough money to fund the
plan for next year and probably the year after, without raising taxes.

This plan will not reduce your fire insurance.

The decision to implement the Amador Plan was made by a handful of
people. No effort was made to contact the property owners to find out if they
felt a need for a different type of fire protection.

Vote no on Measure E. It will cost far too much money for the benefits
received and there is already a surplus of $52,000.00 in the fire fund.

LOIS SCHULZ - Property Owner

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE E

Is forty-four cents per day to high a price to pay for medical aid and additional
fire protection for you, your family and your home?

The State has mandated that in 2005 all volunteer fire departments will have
to meet professional fire-fighters standards. The ramifications of not meeting
this mandate is unknown at this time. Contracting with the California Division
of Forestry meets both the needs of the Community and the criteria set by the
State.

The period from November 1 thru May 31st poses a significant risk to
permanent residents due to wood stoves and medical emergences caused by
winter conditions. Permanent residences will be well served by the additional
fire and medical protection. The last structure fire we had burned a home
during the winter months.

We have a balance of $50,500.00 in our fire department funds which would
pay for the Amador Plan for 2002/2003. The new fire assessment would not
be collected until fiscal year 2003/2004.

Having CDF so close would enhance our Fire Department, which we want to
maintain, and would also allow our volunteers to get the training and support
they need.
