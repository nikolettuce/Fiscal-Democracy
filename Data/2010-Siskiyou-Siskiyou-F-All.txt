A RESOLUTION OF THE SISKIYOU COUNTY
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS
ON BEHALF OF COUNTY SERVICE AREA NO. 4
PROPOSING THE ADOPTION OF A SPECIAL TAX
IN THE GREATER MCCLOUD
FIRE AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE ZONE

WHEREAS, the Board of Supervisors of Siskiyou County has
determined that it is in the best interest of the residents and property
owners within the Greater McCloud Fire and Emergency Response
Zone (the “Zone”) that sufficient funding be provided to the Zone in
order to insure the Zone is able to provide fire suppression, prevention
and emergency medical services within the Zone; and

WHEREAS, in 1994, the voters of in the Greater McCloud Fire and
Emergency Response Zone of County Service Area No. 4 approved
a special property tax in the amount of $45.00 per improved parcel
per year, and lesser amounts for unimproved parcels and additional
parcels, to provide a stable source of funding to obtain, furnish, operate
and maintain fire suppression equipment, apparatus and related
services; and

WHEREAS, the Board of Supervisors has determined that due to
increased costs to the Greater McCloud Fire and Emergency' Response
Zone the amount of revenue available to the Greater McCload Fire
and Emergency Response Zone is inadequate to meet the costs of
operating and maintaining the services and facilities that the Zone
provides; and

WHEREAS, the Board of Supervisors has determined that it is
necessary and appropriate to submit a proposal to the voters in the
Zone for the adoption of an increase in the special property tax
previously approved by the voters.

NOW THEREFORE THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OF THE
COUNTY OF SISKIYOU RESOLVES AS FOLLOWS:

SECTION I. Authority. This resolution is adopted pursuant to
Government Code Section 25215.2, Government Code Section 50075,
et seq, and Articles XIII A and XIII C of the California Constitution.

SECTION II. Me. This Resolution may be cited as “The Greater
McCloud Fire and Emergency Response Zone Special Tax Resolution
of 2010.”

SECTION III. Proposal. It is proposed that a special tax measure
be submitted to the voters in the The Greater McCloud Fire and
Emergency Response Zone. Such action is taken in accordance with
Government Code Section 50075, et seq. and Article XIII(A) of the
California Constitution. The special tax would replace that currently
in effect. If this measure is defeated, the original, current existing
special tax will remain in place,

SECTION IV. Parcel Defined. “Parcel” as used herein shall refer
to a legal parcel. A legal parcel means a parcel of land legally separated
from all adjoining parcels under the provisions of the California
Subdivision Map Act.

SECTION V. Rate to be Charged as a Special Tax. There shall be
levied on each parcel within the Greater McCloud Fire and Emergency
Response Zone a special tax as follows:

Improved parcels:	$76.50 each

Unimproved parcels:	$54.00 each (first and second

unimproved parcels)

$20.25 each (next third and fourth
unimproved parcels)

$6.75 each (five + parcels)

Example: An owner five unimproved parcels would pay
$155.25 ($108.00 + $40.50 + $6.75).

Thereafter, said tax shall be increased each year by a percentage
equal to the Consumer Price Index, all urban consumers, U.S. City
average, as measured in the month of April each year, except that
said increase shall not exceed 3% in any given year.

Said special tax shall not be levied on any property belonging to
the State or Federal governments or any local governmental agency.
Property on the Board roll is subject to the special tax.

For purposes of this Resolution, “improved parcels” shall be defined
to mean those parcels on either the secured or unsecured roll having
an improvement value of more than Three Thousand Dollars

($3,000.00). “Unimproved parcels" shall be defined to mean those
parcels on either the secured or unsecured roll having an improvement
value of Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000.00) or less.

SECTION VI. Lew of Charge. The Board of Supervisors finds
and declares that this is a special tax and not an ad valorem tax.
Further, the Board finds and declares that the most expedient way
to levy and collect this special tax is on a parcel basis as set forth
above.

SECTION VII. Method of Collection. This special tax, if confirmed
by the voters, shall appear as a separate item on the tax bill. The
special tax shall be collected at the same time and in the same
manner as ordinary County ad valorem taxes and shall be subject to
the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in the case of
delinquency as provided for such ad valorem taxes. All laws applicable
to the levy, collection, and enforcement of County ad valorem property
taxes shall be applicable to such tax; except if for the first year such
tax is levied, the real property to which such tax relates has been
transferred or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value, or if a
lien of a bona fide encumbrance for value has been created and
attached thereto prior to the date on which the first installment of
such taxes would become delinquent, the tax confirmed pursuant to
this Resolution will not result in a lien against such property, but
instead shall be transferred to the unsecured roll for collection.

SECTION VIII. Purpose of Special Tax. The express purpose
for which this special tax is levied is to establish a stable source of
funds within the Greater McCloud Fire and Emergency Response
Zone of County Service Area No. 4 to obtain, furnish, operate, and
maintain fire suppression equipment, apparatus, and related services,
for the protection of life and property in the Greater McCloud Fire
and Emergency Response Zone. Any funds collected from the special
tax levied pursuant to this Resolution shall be expended only for such
services. Any unexpended funds raised by the levy remaining at the
end of the fiscal year shall be carried over for the same purposes in
the next fiscal year. Nothing herein precludes County Service Area
No. 4 from contracting with other agencies to carry out the purposes
of this resolution.

The County Fire Warden shall, after consulting with the Local
Advisory Board for the Zone, advise the Board of Supervisors of the
resource and financial allocation plan for the ensuing fiscal year. The
Board of Supervisors shall finally approve any resource and financial
allocation plan for the Greater McCloud Fire and Emergency Response
Zone of County Service Area No. 4.

SECTION IX. Election Date. The proposed special tax shall be
submitted to the voters of the Greater McCloud Fire and Emergency
Response Zone of County Service Area No. 4 for their approval on
November 2, 2010.

SECTION X. Effective Date. If the proposed special tax
receives the approval of two-thirds of the voters upon the proposition,
the special tax, upon the certification of the election, will become a
lien on the applicable properties as of January 1, 2011, and will
initially be billed on the 2011-12 secured tax roll.

SECTION XI. Authority to Decrease Charge. Nothing in this
Resolution shall give the Board of Supervisors the authority to increase
the special tax levied hereunder without a confirming vote of at least
two-thirds of the voters in the Greater McCloud Fire and Emergency
Response Zone of County Service Area No. 4 voting on such proposal.
However, nothing herein will prevent the Board of Supervisors from
lowering or eliminating such special tax upon a majority of its own
vote after notice and hearing on such proposal.

SECTION XII. Publication. This Resolution shall be published
once in the Mt. Shasta Herald, a newspaper of general circulation,
printed and published in County Service Area No. 4, within fifteen
(15) days after passage hereof.

SECTION XIII. Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence,
clause, or phrase of this Resolution is for any reason held to be
unconstitutional or otherwise unlawful, such decision shall not affect
the validity of the remaining portions of this Resolution. The Board
of Supervisors hereby declares that it would have passed this
Resolution and each section, subsection, sentence, clause, or phrase
thereof irrespective of the fact that one or more of the sections,
subsections, sentences, clauses, or phrases be declared
unconstitutional or unlawful.

SECTION XIV. Accountability Measures.

A.	Account. Upon the levy and collection of the tax authorized
by this resolution, an account shall be created into which the proceeds
of the tax shall be deposited.
