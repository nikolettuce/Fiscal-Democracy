IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS MEASURE C
CITY OF FERNDALE

The City of Ferndale currently imposes a tax in the amount of 8% of the rent
charged to persons who stay at a hotel within the Ferndale City limits. This tax
is called the transient occupancy tax ("TOT’’). The tax is paid by the hotel room
occupant directly to the hotel operator at the time the occupant pays his or her
hotel bill. Hotel operators hold the collected taxes in trust for the benefit of the
City and remit the taxes quarterly to the City tax administrator.

If this measure is approved by the electorate, the TOT shall increase by 2% from
the present 8% rate to 10%. Therefore, if this measure is approved, a person
who stays in a hotel within the City of Ferndale will pay 10% of the rent charged
by the hotel operator as a TOT. All of the TOT revenues collected by the City are
used, and shall continue to be used, for City general fund purposes.

The ordinance proposed by this ballot measure will be adopted if this measure
is approved by a simple majority of those electors voting on the measure at the
November3,2015 election.

A “yes” vote would approve an increase in the City's TOT by 2%. A “no” vote
would reject the proposed 2% increase in the City’s TOT.

S/ Russell S. Gans, City Attorney

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure C. If you desire a copy
of the ordinance, please call tne City Clerk for the City of Ferndale at (707) 786-
4224 and a copy will be mailed at no cost to you. The proposed ordinance can
also be viewed at (or a copy obtained from) Ferndale City Hall, 834 Main Street,
Ferndale, California, during regular business hours. A copy of the ordinance
may also be viewed on the City of Ferndale's website at: http://ci.ferndale.ca.us/.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE C
CITY OF FERNDALE

The Transient Occupancy Tax would be paid by individuals who rent hotel/
motel rooms in Ferndale. Revenue generated from the Transient Occupancy
Tax would help to pay for our City’s police, fire, environmental programs, street
maintenance, parks and recreation and other general government operations.

Ferndalels current Transient Occupancy Tax rate is 8 percent. The other cities in
Humboldt County have a 10 percent tax rate, so an adjustment in the Transient
Occupancy Tax rate to 10 percent will keep Ferndale in line with our neighboring
communities.

The City Council wants to develop revenues to provide the services and
programs this community wants and deserves; and the Transient Occupancy Tax
is a beneficial way to produce new revenue from tourists, visitors, and business
travelers who use City services.

Help your community have safer streets and neighborhoods, and continue a
tradition of outstanding public services. Please vote Yes on Measure C.

The undersigned proponent or author of the primary argument in favor of ballot
measure C at the General Election for the Humboldt County District to be held
on November 3,2015 hereby states that such argument is true and correct to the
best of his knowledge and belief.
