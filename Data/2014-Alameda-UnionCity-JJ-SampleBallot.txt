MEASURE _

CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

The City Council of the City of Union City is submitting to the voters the question of whether to
approve an ordinance that would temporarily extend an existing one-half of one percent (0.50%) - or
one half-cent to the price of an item that costs a dollar - transactions and use tax within the City. If

approved, Measure_____would continue an existing tax approved by the voters in November 2010. The

extension would be for ten years.

Technically, the existing “sales tax” is a combination of “sales and use tax” and “transactions and use
tax.” With some exceptions, both are levied on the sale or use of tangible personal property sold at
retail. Retailers collect the tax at the time of sale and remit the funds to the State Board of Equalization,

which administers the tax. Because Measure_____does not limit the use of tax revenue, it is a “general

tax,” not a “special tax” that restricts the funds to specific purposes. The tax proceeds cannot legally be
taken away by the State.

Currently, the tax on retail sales in Union City is 9.50% of the purchase price. Measure_does not

increase the current tax rate; it only extends the voter-approved Measure AA sales tax for another ten
years. The tax would automatically terminate after ten years unless extended by the voters.

If approved, one hundred percent of the proceeds of this local tax would continue to go to the City’s
general fund and will be available to support the full range of municipal services, including but not
limited to police, fire, paramedic, library, streets, parks and recreation services, including youth, family
and senior programs. If this tax extension is not approved by the voters, the City will have to reduce
essential services and cut programs.

A “Yes” vote is a vote to approve the extension of the voter-approved Measure AA one half-cent sales
tax for ten years, with oversight on the revenue and expenditure of funds from the tax by a committee
of members of the public. A “No” vote is a vote to not extend the existing tax and the existing tax

would no longer be collected. Measure______would be approved if it received a simple majority of “Yes”

votes.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure_____. If you desire a copy of the proposed

ordinance, please call the City Clerk’s office at 510-675-5448 and a copy will be mailed at no cost to you.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE

Vote YES on - Protect Union City services, without raising taxes.

YES on_____does not create a new tax. It simply continues an existing, voter-approved local sales

tax measure adopted by Union City voters in 2010 that has maintained essential services for our
City in a recovering economy.

Sacramento has taken $10 million from Union City. Without Measure____, our City will lose $4 Million

annually, resulting in devastating cuts to your services.

All Measure____funds are legally required to be spent on our LOCAL services and Sacramento can’t

touch it! YES on____protects our essential City services by maintaining Union City’s financial stability

and quality of life over the next 10 years, when Measure_is legally required to expire.

Yes on____maintains 911, paramedic and fire protection services

Yes on____maintains police services, rapid response times, and neighborhood patrols

Yes on____maintains emergency and disaster preparedness programs

Yes on____maintains library hours, services and access to books, computers and the Internet

Yes on____maintains after-school programs for children/teens and classes for residents with special

needs

YES on_____continues the City’s transparent, responsible fiscal accountability, with annual public

financial audits that guarantee funds are spent responsibly and as promised on your priorities.

Union City residents, elected leaders, and employees all value our City’s tradition of fiscal
prudence and accountability. That’s why City employees stepped up and now contribute 100%
of their share of pension costs. And thanks to the community’s support, we have all been
successful in maintaining your quality of life services over the past 4 years.

Please join the entire Union City City Council in supporting YES on__to protect and maintain

Union City’s public safety and community services, without raising taxes.

ORDINANCE NO.___________

AN ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF
UNION CITY AMENDING SECTION 3.22.050 OF THE
UNION CITY MUNICIPAL CODE TO EXTEND THE EXISTING, VOTER-APPROVED
MEASURE AA TRANSACTIONS AND USE (SALES) TAX ADMINISTERED BY
THE STATE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION

WHEREAS, the City of Union City (“Union City”), like many other cities, continues to
be impacted by what is commonly referred to as the “Great Recession” and past financial
takeaways from the State; and

WHEREAS, this current economic crisis has significantly reduced property and sales tax
revenue; and

WHEREAS, the revenue from property taxes and sales taxes has historically been Union
City’s most significant revenue source; and

WHEREAS, the substantial reduction in property and sales tax revenue has in turn
impacted the general fund; and

WHEREAS, the general fund is vital to Union City’s maintenance of essential services
such as police patrols, safe neighborhoods, and 9-1-1 rapid response times for fire and
emergency services; and

WHEREAS, Union City has implemented reductions in services; and

WHEREAS, Union City would like to avoid additional cuts to essential services; and

WHEREAS, the City Council has determined that the continued loss of revenues from
property and sales tax revenue, without any additional revenue source, would result in the City
being unable to continue providing essential services to its citizens at a necessary and minimum
level; and

WHEREAS, at an election held on November 2, 2010, a majority of the voters of the
City of Union City approved a local funding measure that provided revenue that could not be
taken by the State commonly known as “Measure AA”; and

WHEREAS, Measure AA has been critical in maintaining essential City services, such
as 911 emergency response, police patrols, fire protection, youth, senior, after-school, library
and family recreational services, as well as programs for residents with special needs, among
others; and

WHEREAS, Measure AA is set to expire on the fourth anniversary of the operative date
thereof, unless extended by a majority of the voters of the City; and

WHEREAS, the City of Union City has carefully evaluated how to deal with this
potential loss of funds, while continuing to provide the quality of life services that community
residents rely upon; and

WHEREAS, without Measure AA, the City of Union City will not be able to maintain
all existing programs, will not be able to adequately maintain infrastructure or facilities, and will
not be able to maintain the service levels currently in place; and

WHEREAS, a continuation of Measure AA with no increase in tax rate, will ensure that
all money raised will be controlled locally for local services, and cannot be taken away by the
State; and

WHEREAS, Measure AA is codified in Chapter 3.22 of the Union City Municipal Code.
Under section 3.22.150 “Termination Date,” Measure AA is set to expire at the end of March
2015, unless extended by the voters, which would deprive the City of a crucial source of funding
to prevent severe cuts to essential services such as police, fire, paramedic, library, streets, parks
and other services; and

WHEREAS, the proposed measure would extend the existing Measure AA tax for 10
years on the sale of tangible personal property and the storage, use, or other consumption of such
property. The tax rate would continue to be one-half of one percent (0.5%) (a one-half cent for
each dollar) of the sales price of the property. The tax revenue would be collected by the State
Board of Equalization and remitted to the City. The tax would be in effect for an additional 10
years , and would then expire automatically, unless extended by the voters. The tax shall be
approved if the measure receives at least a simple majority of affirmative votes.
