IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL
CRESCENT FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT
CONTINUANCE OF ASSESSMENT, MEASURE D

Measure D was placed on the ballot by the Board of Directors of the
Crescent Fire Protection District.

Property within the Crescent Fire Protection District is currently subject to
a benefit assessment of varying' amounts depending on the nature of the
improvements and the use to which the property is put. A single family home
pays a benefit assessment of $24.00 per year. Pursuant to action previously
taken by the Board of Directors this benefit assessment will expire on June
30, 1989 unless the voters approve the extension authorized by this
measure.

The measure, if passed by a majority of the voters, will extend the benefit
assessment for an indefinite period of time. During that extension the Board
of Directors will have the authority to reduce the amount of the assessment
as they deem necessary or to maintain the maximum assessment provided
for in their prior action

A YES vote will authorize the current benefit assessment to continue
indefinitely beyond the expiration date of June 30, 1989. A NO vote would
cause the benefit assessment to cease to be collected after the expiration date
of June 30, 1989.

s/John W. Anderson

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE D

Crescent Fire Protection District (which serves the largest population in Del
Norte County), is classified as a "Special District" and as such is totally
separate from Del Norte County Government. The District receives approx-
imately one and one half (IV2) pennies from each of your property tax dollars
paid to the County.

This revenue is insufficient to pay the annual operational expenses for the
District. As other funding sources have dried up, the District was left with no
recourse other than to initiate the assessment fee.

This assessment fee was legally approved by you, the citizens of the
district in June, 1987, however the Board of Directors expressed concerns on
providing a means for you to vote on the measure. This promise by the Board
of Directors is now being kept by providing you the opportunity to vote on
Measure D at the November 1988 General Election.

This assessment fee has allowed the District to continue its operations and
relieve itself of some of the indebtedness, WE URGE YOUR CONTINUED
SUPPORT BY CASTING A YES VOTE. Thank you.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE D

VOTE "NO" ON MEASURE D! The way the Measure is written, the
Crescent Fire Protection District - WANTS TO - AND CAN - AND WILL - collect
this assessment fee for as long as the CFPD exists; for as long as Del Norte
County exists; for as long as Crescent City exists; for longer than anyone now
alive in the CFPD will live.

The measure is written: "SHALL THE CRESCENT FIRE PROTECTION
DISTRICT CONTINUE WITH THE BENEFIT ASSESSMENT FEE ENACTED AS
OF JUNE 5,1987?” Please notice one very small omission from the measure:
THERE IS NO INDICATION OF ANY TIME LIMIT FOR THE COLLECTION OF
THIS FEE.

Without a specified time limit for the imposition of this fee, everyone living
in the CFPD will (by a YES vote) commit himself to paying this fee for
eternity. There is a maxim that "The end justifies the means.” The precept of
that maxim is not resorted to by honest people, by honest civil servants.

If the CFPD had set a time limit in the Measure for the length of time this
fee would remain in existence, there might have been some justification for
approving it.

AS MEASURE D IS WRITTEN. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO JUSTIFICATION
FOR APPROVING THAT THIS FEE BE CONTINUED VOTE WITH YOUR
POCKETBOOK! VOTE WITH YOUR HEAD! VOTE "NO" ON MEASURE D.

s/ William J. A. Rohe

ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE D

VOTE "NO” ON MEASURE D. When this Benefit Assessment Fee was
being enacted, the Crescent Fire Protection District solicited an "expression
of negative opinion”, in effect, a “vote" opposing the fee but, a "vote” that
was declared not to be a vote. The procedure for conducting this non-vote
vote was extremely irregular and improper. The submitted protests were at all
times in the complete control of the organization that would benefit if the
protest FAILED. The submitted protests were evaluated by the organizations
that would benefit if the protest FAILED. These two factors were absolute
conflicts of interest There was uncertainty concerning the number of pro-
tests that could be submitted; the number changed to the increasing benefit
of the CFPD with every report of the result. There was uncertainty concerning
the number of VALID protests submitted; the number changed with every
report of the result. This solicitation of opinion should have been conducted
in its entirety by a group of persons who had no association of any kind with
the CFPD. The CFPD should have participated only to the extent of furnishing
the list of protests solicited, with a certificate that it was a true list. The
subsequent response should have been evaluated by comparison only
against that same list; not against information from another source - as was
done. Now, the CFPD wants to extend the imposition of that fee for an
unspecified length of time. With no limitation set, this type of fee can go on
forever. VOTE "NO” ON MEASURE D AND LET THE TRUE OPINION OF THIS
MISBEGOTTEN FEE BE MADE KNOWN. VOTE “NO" ON MEASURE D.

s/ William J. A. Rohe

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE D

Vote “YES" on Measure D. Crescent Fire District Volunteers need your
continuing support.

Don’t be mislead by rumor and erroneous information, relating to the
Assessment Fee proposal. California Government Code Section 50078 et seq.
spells out the procedures, jurisdictional responsibility and methods of com-
piling data. CFPD went to great lengths to ensure the legality and correctness
of the proposal (with the Fire Districts Association of California and a
specializing Law Firm, after which the proposal was reviewed by County
Counsel and the Del Norte County Grand Jury for applicability).

Lets stick to the facts, of the problem!

Revenue sources are becoming unavailable or dewindling-Del Norte
County is in a vast development phase--CFPD has fire protection respon-
sibility for one half the County’s population.

This assessment fee has allowed the District to continue its operations and
relieve itself of some of the indebtedness.

We appreciate your support of our endeavors to "PROTECT LIFE and
PROPERTY”.

Vote “YES" on Measure D. Thank you.
