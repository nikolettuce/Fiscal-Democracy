MEASURES SUBMITTED TO VOTE OF VOTERS

STATE



62

LOCAL TAXATION. For new and in-
. creased taxes, local governments and dis-
tricts need two-thirds popular vote—-spe-
. .• ciattaxes; majority—general taxes. Fiscal
'impact: Prieverits new 6r higher general
taxes by local agencies without voter ap-
proval. Could reduce local agencies’ exist-
ing tax revenues, if their voters do not
ratify the continuation of new or higher
taxes adopted after August 1,1985. Provi-
sions imposing penalties and requiring
voter approval cannot be applied to char-
ter cities.



OFFICIAL STATE LANGUAGE. Re-
quires Legislature and state officials to
ensure English as official state common
03 language. Provides for private enforce-
ment. Fiscal impact: No direct effect on
the costs or revenues of the state or local
governments.

ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY
SYNDROME (AIDS), Declares AIDS
virus carrier a contagious condition, sub-
ject to quarantine and reportable disease
regulation. Fiscal impact: The measure’s
cost could vary greatly depending upon its
interpretation by health officers and
Cd courts. If existing discretionary commu-
nicable disease controls were applied to
AIDS, given the current state of medical
knowledge, there would be no substantial
change in state and local costs. If measure
were interpreted to require added disease
controls, costs could range to hundreds of
millions of dollars per year depending on
measures taken.

TOXIC DISCHARGE AND EXPOSURE
RESTRICTIONS. Prohibits discharge of
toxic chemicals into drinking water and
requires warnings of toxic chemicals ex-
DC posure. Fiscal impact: Costs of state and
local enforcement are estimated at
$500,000 in 1987 and thereafter would
depend on many factors, but could exceed
$1,000,000 annually. Costs would be par-
tially offset by fines collected.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE D

ARGUMENTO EN FAVOR DE LA MEOIDA D

On the November 4th ballot Measure D is being placed before the voters in the Button-
willow Recreation & Park District to help raise sufficient revenue to allow the Recreation
District to pay off obligations it has incurred and has been unable to meet.

The Measure simply allows for an assessment of $10.00 on each parcel of land within
the boundaries of the recreation district. This tax will be collected on a regular yearly
basis. (For an indefinite period.)

The Recreation District has been providing recreational activities for the Buttonwillow
area since 1973. The districts programs are designed to allow participation by all age
groups and provides an invaluable service to the community.

Without the additional monies which would be raised by the tax, the district would be
unable to function further and would have to cease operations altogether. Your approval
uf this tax is therefore requested.

Backed by the Pioneer Senior Citizens Club,

Recreation and Park Director

En la balota del 4 de noviembre se coloca la Medida D ante los votantes en el Distrito
de Parque y RecreaciOn de Buttonwillow para ayudar a reunir ingresos suficientes para
permitir al Distrito de RecreaciOn a pagar obligaciones que ha contraido y que no ha
podido pagar.

La Medida permite sencillamente una tasaciOn de $10.00 sobre cada parcela de tierra
dentro de los limites del distrito de recreaciOn. Este impuesto sera reunido regularmente
sobre una base anual. (Por un periodo indefinido.)

El Distrito de RecreaciOn ha estado proporcionando actividades recreacionales para el
area de Buttonwillow desde 1973. Los programas de! distrito estan diseflados para
permitir la particiapciOn de gente de todas las edades y provee un servicio valioso para
ia comunidad.

Sin el dinero adicional que seria reunido por el impuesto, el distrito no podria continuar
funcionando y tendria que parar sus operaciones completamente. Por esto, se solicita *
su aprobaciOn de este impuesto.

Apoyado por el Club de Ciudadanos de Avanzada Edad de Pioneer.
