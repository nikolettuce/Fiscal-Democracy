CITY OF HAYWARD MEASURE	
y MEASURE F: “Shall the people of the City of Hayward approve the continued collection of the Supplemental 1 Building Construction and Improvement Tax; a general tax paid by developers which is used to fund all general gov- ernmental services including, but not limited to: police, fire and public works?”	YES
	NO

AN ORDINANCE OF THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY OF HAYWARD
APPROVING THE CONTINUED COLLECTION OF THE SUPPLE-
MENTAL BUILDING CONSTRUCTION AND IMPROVEMENT TAX
(HAYWARD MUNICIPAL CODE SECTION 8-15.01 et seq.)

CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE F

Measure F seeks approval for the continued collection of the Supplemental
Building Construction and Improvement Tax (“SBCIT”). The SBCIT, enacted
by the City Council in October 1990, is a general tax imposed upon new con-
struction and certain commercial construction improvements in the City. Most
of the future revenue will be collected from developers, contractors and builders
who seek permits for development projects. Revenue from the SBCIT is used
to fund general governmental services such as police services, fire department
services and public works projects.

Measure F does not impose any new taxes or change existing law. Proposi-
tion 218, passed by California voters on November 5, 1996 requires general
taxes, such as the SBCIT to be approved by a majority of the voters if the tax is
to continue beyond November 5, 1998. Without majority approval, authority to
collect the SBCIT will end and the fiscal impact to the City’s general fund will
be a reduction of approximately $1.4 million dollars annually.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE F

In keeping with Proposition 218, Hayward voters are urged to vote yes on
Measure F. A yes vote means that critical City services will continue without
interruption.

Measure F allows the City to continue to collect the Supplemental Business
Construction and Improvement Tax. Started in 1991 but made permanent in
1995, this tax is paid by developers who build new housing units, or who con-
struct or enlarge commercial or industrial buildings.

Measure F does not create a new tax, nor does it increase an existing tax.
Rather, Measure F allows the City to continue to collect a tax it has been col-
lecting from developes since 1991.

This tax generates about $1.4 million per year and funds such vital City ser-
vices as police and fire operations and other general government activities. In
addition, funds from this tax are used to repair City streets, install traffic signals,
and reduce traffic congestion.

Without this tax, there will be fewer dollars to respond to the service needs
of our neighborhoods, and the quality of life in Hayward will suffer.

New development should and must pay its fair share. A yes vote guarantees
that this will happen.

Vote yes on Measure F.
