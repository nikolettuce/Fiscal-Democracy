CITY OF ORANGE COVE
POLICE AND FIRE SPECIAL TAX MEASURE O

Shall City of Orange Cove establish a Special Tax for Police and Fire with an annual $95
parcel tax for single-family homes and specified amounts for multifamily, commercial,
agricultural, and industrial parcels to improve public safety, response times, and
training; maintain number of on-duty police officers; fight crime, drugs and gangs; and
provide firefighting equipment; with revenues used only for Police and Fire; and subject
to Citizen Oversight Committee?

YES OR NO

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY

The City Council of the City of Orange Cove has placed Measure O on the
November 4, 2014, ballot to ask the City voters to approve an ordinance that would
enact a special tax within the City for Police and Fire services only. An ordinance is a
City law.

The City has a Police Department which provides law enforcement services. The
City operates and maintains its Police Department primarily with general funds and
secondarily with occasional grant funding. Fire prevention and protection services are
provided by the Orange Cove Fire Protection District, a separate legal entity. The City
has historically assisted the Orange Cove Fire Protection District with funding for fire
prevention and protection in the City.

The measure, if approved by the voters, would establish an ordinance authorizing the
assessment of a tax on each parcel within the City unless the parcel is exempt by law.
The amount of the tax is specified in the ordinance as follows: single family ($95.00
per parcel), multifamily ($65.00 per unit), agricultural ($95.00 per parcel), commercial
($495.00 per parcel), and industrial ($750.00 per parcel). The proposed tax would be
placed on the assessor’s tax roll for each parcel and collected by the County through its
property tax bill.

The ordinance requires that the tax revenues may be used only for Police and Fire
services. The ordinance provides that eighty percent (80%) of the revenues would
be used for Police services and twenty (20%) of the revenues would be used for Fire
services. The ordinance requires an Annual Review Report and the creation of a Special
Tax Oversight Committee comprised of City residents.

The special tax under this measure automatically terminates on November 30, 2024. If
the ordinance is approved, it may not be amended or repealed except by the City voters.

A “Yes” vote on the measure is a vote to approve the ordinance establishing a special tax
for Police and Fire services. A “No” vote is a vote against the ordinance. The measure
would be approved if it receives a two thirds (2/3) majority of “Yes” votes.

City Attorney

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE O

Vote yes on Measure “O” to keep our City safe. Measure “O” will ensure our children,
families and businesses have a safe place to live and work by providing much needed
funds for our Police and Fire Departments.

Since the founding of the City’s Police Department in 2008, crime has declined in
the City. This is due to a dedicated Police Department with officers in the City that
have cut response time for emergency calls. Budget cuts, though, have meant lower
staffing levels that threaten the improvements we have made in crime reduction. These
budget cuts have occurred due to a decline in property tax revenues and the end of the
Redevelopment Agency. This threatens the City’s ability to keep our community safe.

The Fire Department has also been constrained by declining revenues. This has
prevented the Fire Department from modernizing and replacing equipment that is
necessary to provide the community with the latest fire fighting training and equipment.

We need this funding to provide our community with police and fire protection that will
enable citizens to live in a safe environment.

Without this measure, it is likely that we will lose experienced police officers and fire
personnel to surrounding communities that can afford pay more in salary and benefits.

Vote Yes on Measure “O” to:

•	Maintain staffing levels to provide emergency response times for police and
fire emergency calls

•	Keep experienced police officers and fire personnel from leaving our City

•	Provide a safe living environment for our children, families and businesses

Measure “O” requires fiscal accountability:

•	Every penny raised by the measure will stay in the City

•	Citizen oversight will ensure funds are spent as promised

Please join community members and local leaders—vote Yes on “O” to keep our City
safe with adequate police and fire protection.
