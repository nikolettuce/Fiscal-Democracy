SECTION I. AUTHORITY. This resolution is adopted pursuant
to Government Code Section 53720.

SECTION II. TITLE. This resolution may be cited as the Mt.
Shasta Fire Protection District Special Tax Resolution of 2003.

SECTION III. PROPOSAL, It is proposed that a special tax
measure be submitted to the voters in the Mt. Shasta Fire Protection
District. Such action is taken in accordance with Government Code
Section 53720 and Article 13A of the California Constitution. This
proposed special tax is in addition to and not in lieu of previously
approved and levied taxes.

SECTION IV. RATE TO BE CHARGED AS A SPECIAL TAX.
In addition to a previous special tax approved by the voters of the
Mt. Shasta Fire Protection District in 1990, and which shall remain
in effect, regardless of the vote on this special tax, there shall be
levied on each parcel within the Mt. Shasta Fire Protection District

defined to mean those parcels which the County Assessor has affixed
an improvement value on the Secured Tax Roll.

It shall not include any well, septic tank, underground pipeline,
bridge, wharf, power line, mine shaft, tunnel, irrigation ditch, canal,

of County ad valorem property taxes shall be applicable to such
tax; except that if for the first year such tax is levied, the real property
to which such tax related has been transferred or conveyed to a
bona fide purchase for value, or if a lien of a bona fide encumbrancer
for value has been created and attaches thereon prior to the date
on which the first installment of such taxes would become delinquent,
the tax confirmed pursuant to this resolution will not result in a lien
against such real property but instead shall be transferred to the
unsecured roll for collection.

shall be submitted to the voters of the Mt. Shasta Fire Protection
District for their approval on March 2, 2004.

in this resolution shall give the Board of Directors the authority to
increase the special tax levied hereunder without a confirming vote
of at least two thirds of the voters in the Mt. Shasta Fire Protection
District voting on such proposal. However, nothing herein will prevent
the Board of Directors from lowering or eliminating such special tax
upon a majority of its own vote after notice and hearing on such
proposal. Furthermore, the Board may hear any objections or protests
of landowners liable to be assessed this special tax. The Board
may make such adjustments or corrections as it deems just.

SECTION X. PUBLICATION. This resolution shall be
published once in the Mt. Shasta Herald, a newspaper of general
circulation, printed and published in the Mt. Shasta Fire Protection
District, such publication being within 15 days after passage hereof.

MEASURE K

MT. SHASTA FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT
ADOPTION OF A SPECIAL TAX

The Mt. Shasta Fire Protection District is proposing a special
tax measure to be submitted to the voters in the Mt. Shasta Fire
Protection District. This measure, if approved by two thirds of the
electors voting on the question, would authorize the Mt. Shasta Fire
Protection District to levy an additional special tax of Ten Dollars
($10.00) to be added to each parcel as defined in the resolution.
This special tax is in addition to and does not replace previously
approved and levied taxes. If this measure is approved, the total
amount of tax would not exceed Thirty Four Dollars ($34.00) per
year for “improved parcels"; Eighteen Dollars ($18.00) per year for
"open land parcels"; and Forty Six Dollars ($46.00) per year for
"commercial parcels." Each of these types of parcels are further
defined in the resolution authorizing the tax.

Under this proposal, no tax would be levied on any state, federal,
or local entity. The tax would be levied on any property on the
"board roll." This would include, for example, utility and railroad
property.

If confirmed by the voters, the special tax would be levied effective
July 1, 2004. The tax would be collected at the same time and in
the same manner as ordinary County property taxes are collected
and would be subject to the same penalties and procedure in the
case of delinquency.

This special tax would be levied to establish a source of funds
so that the Mt. Shasta Fire Protection District could obtain, furnish,
operate and maintain fire suppression equipment, facilities, apparatus,
and related services for the protection of life and property within
the Mt. Shasta Fire Protection District. The funds could not be used
for any other purpose.

The Mt. Shasta Fire Protection District Board of Directors would
be given the authority to lower but not increase the amount of the
special tax authorized by this measure. Furthermore, the Board
would be authorized to hear any objections or protests from
landowners liable to be assessed. The Board would be authorized
to make any such adjustments or corrections as it deemed just.

A "yes” vote favors passage of the special tax; a "no" vote is
against the passage of a special tax.

regarding the Resolution of the Mt. Shasta Fire Protection District

In order for this issue to be placed on the March 2004 ballot, a
Resolution adopted by a majority of the District Board must be
received by the County Clerk’s Office no later than November 20,
2003.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Laura Bynum at
