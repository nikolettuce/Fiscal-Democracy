Shall the Daly City Utility Users Tax, in place since 1989 and which includes exemptions for low income seniors, blind and disabled persons, be adopted
by ordinance so that it can continue to be collected in order to raise monies for city services including police, fire, parks, libraries, and recreation programs
that might otherwise be reduced if this tax is not collected?

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE G

Measure G, if approved by a majority vote, would allow the Daly City
Utility Users Tax to continue to be collected as it has in the past. The tax
would continue to be applied at the rate of five percent (5%) on
communications services (telephone, cellular, cable), gas, and electric
services.

If adopted by the voters, the tax cannot be increased or changed without a
vote of Daly City voters.

Several exemptions to the tax exist: exemption for low income seniors,
exemption for blind persons and exemption for disabled persons. The tax
would not be levied against persons or entities exempt by state or federal
law, including public schools. The Measure will also update the existing
17 year old ordinance language referencing technology and
telecommunications services, and include amended federal and state
regulations that have been enacted since the original adoption of the City’s
Utility Users Tax.

The utility users tax is a general tax. All revenue generated by the tax
would go to the City’s general fund to provide essential governmental
services including, but not limited to: police, fire, libraries, public works,
parks, recreation programs including recreation programs for seniors and
youth, and other essential local government services. It is estimated that
the tax will generate approximately $6,000,000 of the City’s general fund
budget of $66,000,000 for fiscal year 2006-2007.

This measure must be approved by a majority of the voters.

THE ABOVE STATEMENT IS AN IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF
MEASURE G. IF YOU DESIRE A COPY OF THE MEASURE, THE
PROPOSED ORDINANCE, OR THE EXISTING UTILITY USERS
TAX ORDINANCE, PLEASE CALL THE CITY CLERK’S OFFICE
AT (650) 991-8078, AND A COPY WILL BE MAILED AT NO COST
TO YOU.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE G

Daly City residents have paid a 5% Utility Users Tax on gas, electricity,
telephone and cable for the past 17 years. Approving Measure G will NOT
INCREASE the current tax one cent, it just continues the existing tax.

Due to a change in the law, voters are now required to approve the
collection of this tax for Daly City. IT CANNOT BE INCREASED
WITHOUT A VOTE OF THE PEOPLE.

The utility tax is a local revenue source that is generated 100% in Daly City
and spent 100% for Daly City services. The state cannot take away these
funds.

The City receives $6 million a year from this tax or about 10% of the
annual budget for services such as fire and police protection, libraries,
parks, recreation and senior programs. It costs the average household about
$12 per month, or about 400 a day.

The utility tax is paid based on utility usage; the less you use the less tax
you pay. Businesses also pay their fair share of the tax. Low-income
seniors, blind and disabled persons will be exempt from paying the utility
tax.

Your YES vote on Measure G will help preserve the quality of life that
makes Daly City a great place to live.
