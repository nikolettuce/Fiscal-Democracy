WHEREAS, the City has an interest in providing adequate funding for its police
department to ensure that the police department is sufficiently staffed and equipped to service
City residents; and

WHEREAS, due to a steady increase in the cost of police services, the police department

WHEREAS, the City must find an immediate solution to provide adequate funding for its
police services in order to ensure the health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens and non-

NOW, THEREFORE, THE CITY COUNCIL DOES HEREBY RESOLVE AS FOLLOWS:

Section 1. Purpose. The levy of a city-wide special tax as hereinafter provided is necessary
to fund police services including, but not limited to, four additional officers and equipment. The
proceeds of the special tax shall be deposited in a special fund, maintained by the City. Tax
proceeds, together with any interest and penalties thereon, collected each fiscal year shall be used
for police services, as described in this resolution.

Section 2. Application. The special tax shall be assessed to the owner unless the owner is by
law exempt from taxation, in which case, the tax imposed shall be assessed to the holder of the

1

0RANGE\SASMUNDS0N\26744.1

possessory interest in such parcel, unless such holder is also by law exempt from taxation.

Section 3. Imposition. The Tax shall not exceed the maximum amounts set forth in this
section hereby levied, commencing in the fiscal year 2007-2008, on all taxable properties,
improved or unimproved, within the boundaries of the City. The Tax shall be levied at the
maximum flat rate of sixty four dollars ($64.00) per Single Family Equivalent Residential Unit
(“ERU”). Attachment A defines the specific categories of ERU and is incorporated herein in
full.

For purposes of this Tax, “taxable” properties are those not owned by the City, the
State of California, any other public district or agency of the State or the United States of
America. “Improved” properties are those other than those devoid of any structure as of June 1

unimproved parcels which are dedicated as open space or parklands.

Section 4. Computation and Collection of Tax. The Administrative Services Director or
his/her designee or employee is hereby authorized and directed each fiscal year, commencing
with the fiscal year 2007-2008, to determine the tax amount to be levied for the next ensuing
fiscal year for each taxable parcel of real property within the City, in the manner and as provided
above. The Administrative Services Director is hereby authorized and directed to provide all
necessary information to the auditor/tax collector of the County of Contra Costa to effect proper
billing and collection of the tax, so that the installments of the tax shall be included on the
secured property tax roll of the County of Contra Costa. Unless otherwise required by the City
Council, no Council action shall be required to authorized the annual collection of the special tax
as herein provided.

Section 5. Interest and Penalties. The special tax shall be collected in the same manner as
ordinary ad valorem taxes are collected provided, however, that the City Council may authorize
other appropriate methods of collection of the special tax by appropriate resolution(s). The
special tax shall have the same lien priority, and be subject to the same penalties and the same
procedure and sale in cases of delinquency as provided for ad valorem taxes.

Section 6. Severability. This special tax shall not apply to any person, entity, or property as
to whom or which it is beyond the power of the City to impose the tax herein provided. If for
any reason any portion of this resolution is found to be invalid, or if the special tax is found
inapplicable to any particular parcel within the City, by a Court of competent jurisdiction, the
balance of this resolution and the application of the special tax to the remaining parcels within
the City shall not be affected.

Section 7. Effective Date. This resolution relates to the levying and collecting of the special
tax by the City. It shall be proposed to the electorate at the November 7, 2006, election and shall
be in full force and effect ten (10) days after the certification by the Council of the election
