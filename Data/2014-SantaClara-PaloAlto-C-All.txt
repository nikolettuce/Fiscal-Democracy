Measure C

Amend Utility Users Tax
City of Palo Alto

Majority Approval Required

To ensure continued funding for basic and essential services such as police, fire and
street maintenance and repair, shall the City of Palo Alto maintain the
telecommunications portion of the Utility Users Tax while reducing the rate from
5% to 4.75%; modernize its provisions to ensure equal treatment of taxpayers
regardless of telecommunications technology used; and eliminate a discounted tax
rate paid by a small number of commercial large users of gas, electric and water
services?

Meaning of Voting Yes/No
A YES vote on this measure means:

A vote "For the Ordinance" will modernize the telecommunications language,
reduce the telecommunications tax rate from 5% to 4.75% and eliminate the
discount for large users of water, gas and electricity.

A NO vote on this measure means:

A vote "Against the Ordinance" will keep the UUT as it is.

Impartial Analysis from City Attorney
This measure would amend Palo Alto's Utility Users Tax ["UUT"] ordinance to:
[1] modernize the telecommunications part of the UUT; [2] reduce the
telecommunications tax rate from 5% to 4.75%; and [3] eliminate an existing
rate discount that applies to a small number of customers who use large
volumes of water, gas and electricity.

Palo Alto voters approved the UUT in 1987. Since then there have been no amendments
to the ordinance. The UUT represents 7% of the City's general fund revenue. These
revenues cannot be taken away by the state. They are used for general local
governmental purposes such as police, fire, public works, parks and recreation, library
and capital improvements.

This measure would make three changes to the UUT.

First, the measure would modernize the telecommunication part of the UUT to reflect
changes in federal law, account for technological advances and treat all technologies
equally. In recent years, many cities have modernized the telecommunications part of
their UUT ordinances to respond to changes in federal law and to reflect the shift from
landline telephones to digital communication technologies such as wireless and VOIP.
Federal law does not permit cities to tax internet access and this measure does not alter
this. Most wireless carriers are already including the telecommunications tax on users'
bills. This measure is not expected to result in significant changes to customer bills.

Second, the measure would reduce the telecommunications tax rate from 5% to 4.75%,
for all users.

Third, the measure would eliminate an existing rate discount that benefits the nine
largest users of water, gas and electric utilities. These nine "large users" are big
businesses or institutions. Eliminating the discount will mean the nine "large users" will
pay the same rate that everyone else in Palo Alto already pays.

Reducing the telecommunications tax rate from 5% to 4.75% would result in a small
annual revenue reduction that is expected to be offset by revenue increases from
elimination of the discount for large users of water, gas and electricity.

The ordinance will become effective if a majority of those voting on the measure vote
for it.

A vote "For the Ordinance" will modernize the telecommunications language, reduce the
telecommunications tax rate from 5%to 4.75% and eliminate the discount for large
users of water, gas and electricity.

A vote "Against the Ordinance" will keep the UUT as it is.

Arguments For Measure C

As a result of changes in federal law and advances in technology, Palo Alto's
current Utility Users Tax (UUT) needs to be modernized.

NOT A NEW TAX: Our current UUT was enacted in 1987. It has been a steady source of
local revenue that helps Palo Alto provide a high level of services to residents. However,
the tax was enacted when communication technology was much simpler and the UUT
applied primarily to landline telephones. While most cell phones are already covered by
the existing ordinance, certain other modern telecommunications are not.

FAIR SHARE: Measure C will ensure that everyone pays, regardless of the
telecommunication type or provider they choose.

REDUCES RATE: Although the current rate of 5% is already below the State average of
6%, Measure C reduces the rate to 4.75%.

LOCAL TAX: UUT revenues cannot be taken away by the State. This general tax has
provided funds for important City services like fire and rapid emergency response,
sidewalk, park, playgrounds, and athletic field maintenance. It also helped with
payments to the School District for the historic lease agreement at the former Cubberley
High School site which today offers recreation, playing fields, classes, child care and
senior services in south Palo Alto.

Most neighboring cities have already modernized their UUT language, and it's time that
Palo Alto does too. A NO	vote keeps the tax at current levels. Please join Palo Alto City

Council and community leaders in voting YES on Measure C to modernize the UUT.

Rebuttal to Arguments For

Proponents say Measure C is "NOT A NEW TAX", but it will be a new or an increased tax
for those added to the list of utilities to be taxed.

Proponents say "Our current UUT was enacted in 1987" as though that's a reason to
extend it. The Federal government imposed a 3% excise tax in 1898 to pay for the
Spanish-American war. That tax ended in 2006 and so should Palo Altos' utility tax.

High taxes are causing businesses and employees to leave California by the droves (over
1,500,000 people left in the last 10 years).

One more tax will be just one more reason for businesses to leave California.

The governor of Texas has run radio and TV ADS in California urging businesses to leave
California and move to Texas. And a number of high profile companies have done just
that.

Tax proponents want to charge commercial customers a higher rate. But, all businesses
have to pass all costs of doing business onto their customers, either locally here in Palo
Alto or to other customers from around the world.

So, taxes on businesses are just a hidden tax on their customers, including you.

If so, lets defeat this "hidden" tax increase and send a message to the City Council to cut
at least 2% fat from their bloated budget.

Arguments Against Measure C

As a taxpayer, you pay for services provided by the City via a number of different taxes,
one of them being a Utility User Tax.

As an individual, if you want a service or product, you would expect to have to pay for it
with your money.

Being a person of good conscience, you wouldn't force anyone else to pay for the goods
and services you want. Right?

And you wouldn't hire someone else to steal money to pay for those goods and services.
Right?

But, isn't that what a Utility Tax essentially does?

Through taxation, aren't you hiring someone (government agents) to force other people
to pay for goods and services you want?

And if it is wrong for you as an individual to take money from others, against their will,
isn't also wrong to hire someone to do essentially the same thing on your behalf?

The Palo Alto Utility User Tax wants to increase the tax on "someone else" so they can
continue to provide you with services you presumably want, i.e. police, fire, libraries,
etc.

They want to charge commercial customers a higher rate. But, all businesses have to
pass all costs of doing business onto their customers, either locally here in Palo Alto or
to other customers from around the world.

So, taxes on businesses are just a hidden tax on their customers, including you.

The proponents say "The telecommunications portion of the total UUT revenue is $2.8
million annually or nearly 2 percent of the general fund revenue".

Do you think there's more than 2% waste in the City Government's operations?

If so, lets defeat this "hidden" tax increase and send a message to the City Council to cut
at least 2% fat from their bloated budget.

Rebuttal to Arguments Against

In 1987 Palo Alto voted for the Utility Users Tax, and now the language needs to be
modernized for advances in telecommunications.

This is not a new tax, a NO vote keeps the tax as-is.

A YES vote reduces the tax from 5% to 4.75%.

This tax has been a long-time source of funds for high quality Palo Alto services, totaling
over $3 million in 2014.

A YES vote means all users pay their fair share.

Neighboring cities have already updated their ordinance language. Its time Palo Alto did
too.

Vote YES and support Measure C

withheld the amount of the tax owed by him from the amounts remitted to a service
supplier, or that a service user has failed to pay the amount of the tax for a period or
four or more billing periods, or whenever the director of finance deems it in the best
interest of the city, he shall relieve the service supplier of the obligation to collect taxes
due under this chapter from certain named service users for specified billing periods.

service user at the address to which billing was made by the service supplier, or,
should the service user have changed his address, to his last known address. If a
service user fails to remit the tax to the director of finance within fifteen days from the
date of the service of the notice upon him, which shall be the date of mailing if service
is not accomplished in person, a penalty of twenty-five percent of the amount of the tax
set forth in the notice shall be imposed, but not less than $5.00. The penalty shall

become part of the tax herein required to be paid.

(Ord. 3781 § 1 (part], 1987]

2.35.170 Actions to collect.

Any tax required to be paid by a service user under the provisions of this chapter shall
be a debt owed by the service user to the city. Any such tax collected from a service
user which has not been remitted to the director of finance shall be deemed a debt
owed to the city by the person required to collect and remit. Any person owing money
to the city under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an action brought in
the name of the city for the recovery of such amount including applicable penalties and
attorneys' fees.

The city manager has the authority to adopt rules and regulations not inconsistent with
the provisions of this chapter for the purpose of carrying out and enforcing the
payment, collection and remittance of any tax herein imposed, and the city manager
may also make administrative agreements to vary the strict requirements of this
chapter so that the collection of any tax imposed herein may be made in conformance
with the billing procedures of a particular service supplier so long as the overall results
of such agreements result in collection of the tax in conformance with the general
purpose and scope of this chapter. A copy of such rules and regulations and a copy of

(a]	Claim Required. Prior to seeking judicial relief with respect to a dispute regarding
whether the amount of any tax has been overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously
or illegally collected or received by the city under this chapter, an aggrieved taxpayer,
fee payer, service supplier, service user or any other person must comply with the
provisions of section

2.28.230 of this code.

(b]	Service Suppliers. A service supplier may claim a refund or take as credit against
taxes collected and remitted, the amount overpaid, paid more than once, or
erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner
prescribed by the director of finance that the service user from whom the tax has been
collected did not owe the tax; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit
shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to
the service user or credited to charges subsequently payable by the service user to the
service supplier.

If anv nontaxable charges are combined with and not separately stated from taxable
service charges on the customer's bill or invoice of a service supplier, the combined
charges are subject to tax unless the service supplier identifies, by reasonable and
verifiable standards, the portions of the combined charges that are nontaxable and
taxable through the service supplier's books and records kept in the regular course of
business, and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and not
created and maintained for tax purposes. If the service supplier offers a combination of
taxable and non-taxable services, and the charges are separately stated, then for
taxation purposes, the values assigned the taxable and non-taxable services shall be
based on its books and records kept in the regular course of business and in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and not created and
maintained for tax purposes. The service supplier has the burden of proving the proper
valuation and apportionment of taxable and non-taxable charges.

SECTION 2. General Tax. Proceeds of the tax imposed by this Ordinance shall be
deposited in the general fund of the City and shall be available for any legal purpose.

SECTION 3. Amendment or Repeal. The City Council may repeal Chapter 2.35 of the
Palo Alto Municipal Code or amend that Chapter without a vote of the people except
that any amendment to Chapter 2.35 that increases the amount or rate of tax due from
any Person beyond the inflation-adjusted amounts and rates authorized by this
Ordinance may not take effect unless approved by a vote of the people.

SECTION 4. Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion
of this Ordinance is for any reason held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of
competent jurisdiction, the remaining portions of this Ordinance shall nonetheless
remain in full force and effect. The people hereby declare that they would have adopted
each section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this Ordinance,
irrespective of the fact that any one or more sections, subsections, sentences, clauses,
phrases, or portions of this Ordinance be declared invalid or unenforceable.

SECTION 5. Effective Date. This ordinance shall be effective only if approved by a
majority of the voters and shall go into effect immediately after the vote is declared by
the City Council and the duty of service providers to collect the tax shall commence as
provided in California Public Utilities Code Section 799.

SECTION 6. Execution. The Mayor is hereby authorized to attest to the adoption of this
Ordinance by the voters of the City by signing where indicated below.

City Attorney's Impartial Analysis of Measure C

This measure would amend Palo Alto's Utility Users Tax ("UUT") ordinance to: (1) modernize the
telecommunications part of the UUT; (2) reduce the telecommunications tax rate from 5% to 4.75%; and
(3) eliminate an existing rate discount that applies to a small number of customers who use large
volumes of water, gas and electricity.

Palo Alto voters approved the UUT in 1987. Since then there have been no amendments to the
ordinance. The UUT represents 7% of the City's general fund revenue. These revenues cannot be taken
away by the state. They are used for general local governmental purposes such as police, fire, public
works, parks and recreation, library and capital improvements.

This measure would make three changes to the UUT.

First, the measure would modernize the telecommunication part of the UUT to reflect changes
in federal law, account for technological advances and treat all technologies equally. In recent years,
many cities have modernized the telecommunications part of their UUT ordinances to respond to
changes in federal law and to reflect the shift from landline telephones to digital communication
technologies such as wireless and VOIP. Federal law does not permit cities to tax internet access and
this measure does not alter this. Most wireless carriers are already including the telecommunications
tax on users' bills. This measure is not expected to result in significant changes to customer bills.

Second, the measure would reduce the telecommunications tax rate from 5% to 4.75%, for all

users.

Third, the measure would eliminate an existing rate discount that benefits the nine largest users
of water, gas and electric utilities. These nine "large users" are big businesses or institutions. Eliminating
the discount will mean the nine "large users" will pay the same rate that everyone else in Palo Alto
already pays.

Reducing the telecommunications tax rate from 5% to 4.75% would result in a small annual
revenue reduction that is expected to be offset by revenue increases from elimination of the discount
for large users of water, gas and electricity.

The ordinance will become effective if a majority of those voting on the measure vote for it.

- o2

A vote "For the Ordinance" will modernize the telecommunications language, reduce the
telecommunications tax rate from 5% to 4.75% and eliminate the discount for large users of water, gasq
and electricity.

Argument for Measure C

As a result of changes in federal law and advances in
technology, Palo Alto's current Utility Users Tax (UUT) needs to
be modernized.

NOT A NEW TAX:	Our current UUT was enacted in 1987. It has

been a steady source of local revenue that helps Palo Alto
provide a high level of services to residents. However, the tax
was enacted when communication technology was much simpler and
the UUT applied primarily to landline telephones. While most
cell phones are already covered by the existing ordinance,
certain other modern telecommunications are not.

FAIR SHARE: Measure C will ensure that everyone pays, regardless
of the telecommunication type or provider they choose.

REDUCES RATE; Although the current rate of 5% is already below
the State average of 6%, Measure C reduces the rate to 4.75%.

LOCAL TAX:	UUT	revenues cannot be taken away by the State.

This general tax has provided funds for important City services
like fire and rapid emergency response, sidewalk, park,
playgrounds, and athletic field maintenance. It also helped
with payments to the School District for the historic lease
agreement at the former Cubberley High School site which today
offers recreation, playing fields, classes, child care and
senior services in south Palo Alto.

Most neighboring cities have already modernized their UUT
language, and it's time that Palo Alto does too. A NO
keeps the tax at current levels. Please join Palo Alto City
Council and community leaders in voting	on	Measure,C to

modernize the UUT.

ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF
MEASURE n

Argument Against Palo Alto Utility Tax - Measure C

Proponents say Measure C is "NOT A NEW TAX", but it will be a new or an
increased tax for those added to the list of utilities to be taxed.

Proponents say "Our current UUT was enacted in 1987" as though that's a reason
to extend it. The Federal government imposed a 3% excise tax in 1898 to pay for
the Spanish-American war. That tax ended in 2006 and so should Palo Altos'
utility tax.

High taxes are causing businesses and employees to leave California by the droves
(over 1,500,000 people left in the last 10 years).

One more tax will be just one more reason for businesses to leave California.

The governor of Texas has run radio and TV ADS in California urging businesses to
leave California and move to Texas. And a number of high profile companies have
done just that.

Tax proponents want to charge commercial customers a higher rate. But, all
businesses have to pass all costs of doing business onto their customers, either
locally here in Palo Alto or to other customers from around the world.

So, taxes on businesses are just a hidden tax on their customers, including you.

If so, lets defeat this "hidden" tax increase and send a message to the City Council
to cut at least 2% fat from their bloated budget.

Argument Against Palo Alto Utility Tax - Measure C

As a taxpayer, you pay for services provided by the City via a number of different
taxes, one of them being a Utility User Tax.

As an individual, if you want a service or product, you would expect to have to pay
for it with your money.

Being a person of good conscience, you wouldn't force anyone else to pay for the
goods and services you want. Right?

And you wouldn't hire someone else to steal money to pay for those goods and
services. Right?

But, isn't that what a Utility Tax essentially does?

Through taxation, aren't you hiring someone (government agents) to force other
people to pay for goods and services you want?

And if it is wrong for you as an individual to take money from others, against their
will, isn't also wrong to hire someone to do essentially the same thing on your
behalf?

The Palo Alto Utility User Tax wants to increase the tax on "someone else" so they
can continue to provide you with services you presumably want, i.e. police, fire,
libraries, etc.

They want to charge commercial customers a higher rate. But, all businesses
have to pass all costs of doing business onto their customers, either locally here in
Palo Alto or to other customers from around the world.

So, taxes on businesses are just a hidden tax on their customers, including you.

The proponents say "The telecommunications portion of the total UUT revenue is
$2.8 million annually or nearly 2 percent of the general fund revenue".

Do you think there's more than 2% waste in the City Government's operations?

If so, lets defeat this "hidden" tax increase and send a message to the City Council
to cut at least 2% fat from their bloated budget.

In 1987 Palo Alto voted for the Utility Users Tax, and now the
language needs to be modernized for advances in
telecommunications.

This is not a new tax, a NO vote keeps the tax as-is.

A YES votejreduces the tax from 5% to 4.75%.

This tax has been a long-time source of funds for high quality
Palo Alto services, totaling over $3 million in 2014.

A YES vote means all users pay their fair share.

Neighboring cities.have already updated their ordinance
language. Its time Palo Alto did too.

Vote YES and support Measure C
