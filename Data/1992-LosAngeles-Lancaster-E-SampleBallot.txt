CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF PROPOSITION E

PROPOSITION E proposes the formation of a City-wide Flood Control Benefit
Assessment District in accordance with the Benefit Assessment Act of 1982. This
proposed Flood Control Benefit Assessment District would provide a means to
pay for flood control improvements and services on a City-wide basis and would
eliminate the existing Drainage Maintenance Districts. The Council would be
authorized to levy an annual assessment to pay the costs of providing such facilities
and services. The first year assessments would be established by Proposition E
in an amount equal to $25 per equivalent drainage unit. By way of example, the
first year assessment for a residential property of between 6,000 square feet and
1/2 acre would be $25; an undeveloped 40 acre parcel would be $500; and a 1 acre
commercial/industrial development would be $345. The assessments for other
types of properties can be determined by reference to the Engineer’s Report on
file with the City Clerk. Revenues derived from the assessments may only be spent
for the cost of installation, improvement and maintenance of flood control
facilities.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION E

Lancaster'has-been hit by heavfflooding three times in the last year. Latch time
the Citv and residents have been victimized by flood damage. Flooding in
Lancaster cost you the taxpayer over $1,000,000 in the last year—-just in damage
to PUBLIC property. The City Council needs your help to eliminate future
damage to residences, businesses and the public property you pay for. We need
your YES vote on the Lancaster Drainage/Flood Control Benefit Assessment
District.

The City Council feels this program is the least expensive and fastest means to
alleviate the threat of future flooding. A YES vote would cost the average
household $25 dollars per year (seven cents a day). Households currently in
drainage assessment districts will enjoy a reduction to $25; the remainder of the
households would help share the responsibility by paying the $25 as a new
assessment. If passed, these monies, added to fees developers pay into the
program, will support the construction of the $100 million of flood control
improvements needed to stop our flooding problems.

It has always been important to our citizens that we maintain local control over
how our funds are spent. The Lancaster Drainage/Flood Control Benefit
Assessment District will channel all receipts to LANCASTER projects. Annual
public hearings will be held to get your ideas on how the City can best address
your flood concerns. We need your help to solve our flooding problems; vote YES
on the Drainage/Flood Control Benefit Assessment District Measure.
