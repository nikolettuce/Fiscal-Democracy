IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF BUTLER-KEYS
COMMUNITY SERVICES DISTRICT
MEASURE“Y”

California Government Code Section 61121 autho-
rizes the board of directors of a county community ser-
vices district to impose a special tax for specific purpos-
es. Such a special tax may be imposed to fund any one
or more services which a community services district is
authorized to provide. The resolution or ordinance impos-
ing the tax, as adopted by the board of directors, must
specify the type of tax and rate of tax to be imposed as
well as the method of collection and the date upon which
an election shall be held to approve the levy of the tax.
Further, any special tax must apply uniformly to all tax-
payers or all real property within the district. A resolution
or ordinance imposing such special tax must be approved
by two-thirds of the voters voting upon the measure within
the district. Additionally, if such a special tax is approved
by the voters, the district is required to annually file an
Accountability Report specifying the amount of funds col-
lected and expended from said special tax and the status
of any specific project funded by the tax. This is such a
measure.

This measure, if approved by two-thirds of the voters
voting thereon, will approve the action of the Board of
Directors of the Butler-Keys Community Services District
to impose a special tax within the boundaries of the
Butler-Keys Community Services District in the amount of
forty-five dollars ($45.00) per year per single lot. Said tax
is to begin with fiscal year 2007-2008 and continue for a
period of four (4) years; said tax revenue to be used for
the purpose of maintaining the streets within the Butler-
Keys Community Services District.

This measure is authorized by and is in conformity
with the existing laws of the State of California.

A yes vote on this measure will approve the action of
the Board of Directors of the Butler-Keys Community
Services District to impose a special tax per single lot for
the purpose of maintaining the streets with the bound-
aries of the Butler-Keys Community Services District.

A no vote on this measure will disapprove the action
of the Board of Directors of the Butler-Keys Community
Services District.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE Y

The construction and maintenance of our paved
streets has provided a major convenience to neighbor-
hood residents, greatly improved the aesthetic appeal of
the neighborhood and increased our property values.
Driving on paved streets is safer for drivers and pedestri-
ans, especially children. Automobile repair and mainte-
nance, house cleaning and laundry are reduced by hav-
ing paved streets rather than dirt.

Completed in 1984, the original construction of the
streets cost $97,508.00. Since then the District has spent
$36,718.42 to maintain the aesthetic and structural quali-
ty of the streets to prevent serious deterioration which is
very expensive to repair. The Board of Directors are
determined to keep all costs to a minimum. They volun-
teer their time and talents in service to the community.

Having our streets resealed every five or six years
protects them from deterioration and protects our invest-
ment in them. The streets will need to be resealed again
in four years. To build up the funds for that project, and to
be able to make other street repairs when they are
required, the Board of Directors have placed Measure Y
on the November 2006 election ballot. It has been ten
years since the voters in the District approved the last
four year tax measure for the District. By raising the
funds for these projects in advance the district avoids
paying interest on funds it would otherwise have to bor-
row. The Board of Directors expects that it will be another
ten years before the next tax measure is needed.

To date the property owners in the District have paid
$29.04 per lot per year to have the best streets in Lake
County for twenty two years. That is far less than our
paved streets have increased our property values.
