MEASURE K

AN INITIATIVE MEASURE ADDING A NEW ARTICLE 7
TO CHAPTER 35 OF THE MONTEREY CITY CODE
IMPOSING A GENERAL PURPOSE TRANSACTIONS AND USE TAX
TO BE ADMINISTERED BY THE STATE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION

SECTION 1: A new Article 7 is hereby added to Chapter 35 of the
Monterey City Code imposing a General Purpose Transactions and Use
Tax to be administered by the State Board of Equalization, to read as
follows:

The People of the City of Monterey do ordain as follows:

"ARTICLE 7.

GENERAL PURPOSE TRANSACTIONS AND USE TAX

Sec. 35-69. Title.

This ordinance shall be known as the City of Monterey General Purpose
Transactions and Use Tax Ordinance. The City of Monterey hereinafter
shall be called "City." This ordinance shall be applicable in the incorporated
territory of the City.

Sec. 35-70. Purpose.

This ordinance is adopted to achieve the following, among other
purposes, and directs that the provisions hereof be interpreted in order
to accomplish those purposes:

(a)	To impose a general purpose retail transactions and use tax in
accordance with the provisions of Part 1.6 (commencing with Section
7251) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code and Section 7285.9
of Part 1.7 of Division 2 which authorizes the City to adopt this tax
ordinance which shall be operative if a majority of the electors voting on
the measure vote to approve the Imposition of the tax at an election called
for that purpose.

(b)	To adopt a general purpose retail transactions and use tax
ordinance that incorporates provisions identical to those of the Sales and
Use Tax Law of the State of California insofar as those provisions are
not Inconsistent with the requirements and limitations contained in Part
1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.

(c)	To adopt a general purpose retail transactions and use tax
ordinance that imposes a tax and provides a measure therefore that can
be administered and collected by the State Board of Equalization in a
manner that adapts itself as fully as practicable to, and requires the least
possible deviation from, the existing statutory and administrative procedures
followed by the State Board of Equalization in administering and collecting
the California State Sales and Use Taxes.

(d)	To adopt a general purpose retail transactions and use tax
ordinance that can be administered in a manner that will be, to the greatest
degree possible, consistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of Division 2
of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the burden of record-keeping
upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this ordinance.

Sec. 35-71. Contract with State

Prior to the operative date, the City shall contract with the State Board
of Equalization to perform all functions incident to the administration and
operation of this transactions and use tax ordinance; provided that if the
City shall not have contracted with the State Board of Equalization prior
to the operative date, it shall nevertheless so contract and in such a case
the operative date shall be the first day of the first calendar quarter
following the execution of such a contract.

Sec. 35-72. Transactions Tax Rate.

For the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail, a tax
is hereby imposed upon all retailers in the City at the rate of one quarter
of one percent (0.25%) of the gross receipts of any retailer from the sale
of all tangible personal property sold at retail in said territory on and after
the operative date of this ordinance.

Sec. 35-73. Place of Sale.

For the purposes of this ordinance, all retail sales are consummated
at the place of business of the retailer unless the tangible personal property
sold is delivered by the retailer or his agent to an out-of-state destination
or to a common carrier for delivery to an out-of-state destination. The
gross receipts from such sales shall include delivery charges, when such
charges are subject to the state sales and use tax, regardless of the
place to which delivery is made. In the event a retailer has no permanent

place of business in the State or has more than one place of business,
the place or places at which the retail sales are consummated shall be
determined under rules and regulations to be prescribed and adopted by
the State Board of Equalization.

Sec. 35-74. Use Tax Rate.

An excise tax is hereby imposed on the storage, use or other
consumption in the City of tangible personal property purchased from
any retailer on and after the operative date of this ordinance for storage,
use or other consumption in said territory at the rate of one quarter of
one percent (0.25%) of the sales price of the property. The sales price
shall include delivery charges when such charges are subject to state
sales or use tax regardless of the place to which delivery is made.

Sec. 35-75. Adoption of Provisions of State Law.

Except as otherwise provided in this ordinance and except insofar as
they are inconsistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the
Revenue and Taxation Code, all of the provisions of Part 1 (commencing
with Section 6001) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code are
hereby adopted and made a part of this ordinance as though fully set
forth herein.

Sec. 35-76. Limitations on Adoptions of State Law and Collection of

Use Taxes.

In adopting the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and
Taxation Code:

(a)	Wherever the State of California is named or referred to as the
taxing agency, the name of this City shall be substituted therefore. However,
the substitution shall not be made when:

1.	The word “State" is used as a part of the title of the State
Controller, State Treasurer, State Board of Control, State Board of
Equalization, State Treasury, or the Constitution of the State of
California.

2.	The result of that substitution would require action to be taken
by or against this City or any agency, officer, or employee thereof
rather than by or against the State Board of Equalization, in performing
the functions incident to the administration or operation of this
Ordinance.

3.	In those sections, including, but not necessarily limited to
sections referring to the exterior boundaries of the State of California,
where the result of the substitution would be to:

A.	Provide an exemption from this tax with respect to
certain sales, storage, use or other consumption of tangible
personal property which would not otherwise be exempt from this
tax while such sales, storage, use or other consumption remain
subject to tax by the State under the provisions of Part 1 of
Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, or;

B.	Impose this tax with respect to certain sales, storage,
use or other consumption of tangible personal property which
would not be subject to tax by the state under the said provision
of that code.

4.	In Sections 6701, 6702 (except in the last sentence thereof)
6711, 6715, 6737, 3797 or 6828 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.

(b)	The word "City" shall be substituted for the word "State" in the
phrase "retailer engaged in business of this State" in section 6203 and
in the definition of that phrase in Section 6203.

Sec. 35-77. Permit Not Required.

If a seller’s permit has been issued to a retailer under Section 6067
of the Revenue and Taxation Code, an additional transactor’s permit shall
not be required by this ordinance.

Sec. 35-78. Exemptions and Exclusions.

(a)	There shall be excluded from the measure of the transactions
tax and the use tax the amount of any sales tax or use tax imposed by
the State of California or by any city, city and county, or county pursuant
to the Bradley-Burns Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax Law or the amount
of any state-administered transactions or use tax.

(b)	There are exempted from the computation of the amount of
transactions tax the gross receipts from:

1. Sales of tangible personal property, other than fuel or
petroleum products, to operators of aircraft to be used or consumed
principally outside the County in which the sale is made and directly
and exclusively in the use of such aircraft as common carriers of
persons or property under the authority of the laws of this State, the
United States, or any foreign government.

IMPORTANT NOTICE TO VOTERS

In an effort to clean up the voter rolls and reduce waste, the County of Monterey intends to implement provisions of Elections Code
Section 2224 which allows the county elections office to send a notice to voters who have not voted in any election in the past four
years AND who have not updated their registration during these four years. The notice asks the voters if they still live at the address
where they are registered to vote.

Voters who have neither voted in any election nor updated their registration during the past four years but who return the notice with
an affirmative response will remain on the active list of registered voters.

Voters who do NOT respond affirmatively will be placed on an inactive voter list, and they will no longer receive election materials.

Something New - Permanent Absent Voter Status

Section 3201 of the California Elections Code allows any voter to apply for permanent absent voter
status effective January 1, 2002. Permanent absent voters automatically receive a ballot in the
mail within 29 days before every election in which they are eligible to vote.

You can be a permanent absent voter as long as you wish. However, your permanent status will
end if you fail to return your ballot in a statewide General Election.

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE K

City of Monterey General Purpose Transactions and Use Tax

This ballot measure, if adopted by the voters, would enact a temporary
one-quarter of one percent (14%) increase in the transactions and use
tax rate within the City of Monterey. The “transactions and use tax" referred
to by the ballot measure is more commonly referred to as "sales tax."
The increase in sales tax imposed by this measure would expire in five
(5) years.

The current sales tax rate in the City of Monterey is seven and one-
quarter percent (714%). Accordingly, this ballot measure would increase
the sales tax rate to seven and one-half percent (7'/2%) for the next five
years. The proposed increased sales tax, like the current sales tax, would
be imposed upon the sale of all tangible personal property sold at retail
within the jurisdictional limits of the City, as well as upon the storage,
use, or other consumption of tangible personal property purchased from
any retailer within the jurisdictional limits of the City of Monterey.

All revenue generated from the proposed sales tax increase would
be deposited into the City’s General Fund and, accordingly, all monies
collected pursuant to the sales tax increase would be used by the City
to pay for general City operations and services. As such, this ballot measure
proposes a "general purpose tax” and requires a simple majority vote for
adoption.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE K

Arguments in support or opposition of the proposed laws are
the opinions of the authors.

Approving this small sales tax increase allows residents to help
their city face financial challenges presented by outside forces.

The tax amounts to only an extra 25 cents for a $100 purchase
and ends after five years!

Packaged with cost saving measures by the council, the small
increase allows the City to maintain daily operations and helps avoid
additional cuts to police, fire safety and other services.

Helping keep the Neighborhood Improvement Program, recreation,
Sports Center, and our Library operating at current levels, the money
will not go to new programs or projects.

Monterey has balanced its budget despite the State of California
taking away $17 million from our local taxes since 1992. The State
will take another $2.6 million in the next two years with no payback
provision.

Costs keep rising. Like you, the city must face increased electric,
plumbing, and other maintenance prices. Health care and other
personnel expenses continue to rise. Add State raiding of local funds
to the mix, and our budget is threatened.

The City has made significant cuts over the past two years totaling
$5 million and reduced over 50 positions, including 6 less police
officers, freezing two firefighter positions, and other staffing
reductions.

Without a small sales tax increase, the City may have to cut an
additional 3 to 4 officers and reduce Library hours and staff.
Maintenance to your streets, parks, buildings and other services will
have to be reduced. Fees may have to be drastically increased. This
is not acceptable.

Monterey has never asked for a sales tax increase. In the face
of an ongoing $2 million deficit, this measure is the fairest way to
maintain current services and keep our city a special place to live,
work, and visit.

Please join citizens, businesses, and non-profit organizations
which support this measure.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE K

Arguments in support of the proposed laws are the opinions of
the authors.

City governments are created to serve their citizens. A fiscally
responsible budget prioritizes and spends funds on essential, "must
have,11 services FIRST.

"Must have" budget priorities are fire, police, public works,
library, sewers, storm drains, and 911 dispatch services.

Before taxing citizens for their essential services, the Council
should:

1)	Freeze:

management salaries and benefits,

$13 million civic center,

new hires for non-essential services,

part time position upgrades to full time, and

increases in tourism marketing.

2)	Scale back nonessential programs heavily subsidized by the
general fund.

3)	Avoid costly law suits by following the law.

A recent public records lawsuit cost the City tens of thousands
dollars.

4)	Determine the cost vs. benefit of:

City sponsored special events,
visiting cruise ships (16 this year), and
subsidizing tourist serving development projects.

5)	Involve citizens and locally owned businesses in prioritizing “nice
to have" programs;

Fiscal responsibility means living within the $75 million dollar
projected budget.

The 04 - 05 projected budget has:

$10 million dollars in reserves,
a $2 million dollar shortfall in the General Fund, but
only a $13 thousand shortfall when all funds are accounted
for.

Is it fiscally responsible to threaten to cut police officers, library
services, and maintenance to streets, parks, buildings — the very
services that government exists to provide?

The Council must do what the rest of us are doing — cut
nonessential expenses, and make ends meet without raising
taxes and fees.

The library has City budgets and videotapes of Council budget
discussions.

ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE K

Arguments in support or opposition of the proposed laws are
the opinions of the authors.

The City wants to raise the sales tax based on a projected 5
million dollar shortfall in the 2005-06 City Budget. Sales tax increases
hurt those who can least afford it - seniors, working families, teachers,
public safety employees, and students.

City fees charged to residents and businesses have been raised
before. Municipal charges added to consumers bills have the same
impact as TAXES.

10% of the recent increase in the garbage collection fee goes
to the City.

The residential utility tax was increased 150% on 7/7/95.

The sewer drain fee was raised to $5.44 per month on 3/1/02.
Some claim that Monterey circumvented California Proposition
218 by enacting this sewer "fee" without placing it on the ballot.

Property tax benefits have been provided to out of town
developers -

$7.7 million dollars for the Monterey Peninsula Hotel, and
$2.2 million dollars for Orsio Plaza.

The City has allocated over $13 million dollars in public funds
and loans for the proposed Civic Center. These came from:

$2.5 million cash transferred from the Window on the Bay fund;
$4 million cash transferred from the Sports Center fund;
Indebted the City for $9.5 million in bonds at 3 to 5% with
interest accruing.

In this budget cycle, City Manager and senior management
personnel received raises and increased benefits.

Fiscal impacts of management raises and benefits to current
and future budgets were not fully disclosed.

It is estimated that 30 or more City management employees
have salaries over $100 thousand a year.

The City's budget process is upside down. In a $75 million dollar
budget, the City’s first priority should be public safety, road and
sewer maintenance.

Why is the public being taxed to pay for essential city services?

There are better ways to balance the City budget than by
increasing taxes.

si Barbara Bass Evans, Council Candidate

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE K

Arguments in support or opposition of the proposed laws are
the opinions of the authors.

This measure asks for a quarter for vour city (a $100 purchase
would cost only 250 more). It’s the fairest, most reasonable way to
keep Monterey whole. It will help maintain crucial police and fire
services, streets, parks, our library, and other operations. It enables
our city to meet financial challenges forced upon it, mainly by the
State.

The confusing argument against this measure requires several
clarifications. Here are samples.

The argument mixes up fees and taxes. Measure K helps the
city avoid higher fees for vital child care, senior citizens, the library,
recreation, and our youth.

The residential utility tax has been reduced from 5% to 2%, not
"increased by 150%.“

Not one penny of taxpayer money or “property tax benefit" goes
to the Monterey Peninsula Hotel. The City is guaranteed at least
$500,000 yearly in taxes, and all deferred payments will be paid in
full. Without these deferrals, the hotel will never be built and the
city receives absolutely nothing.

By law, the Joan to the 30 unit affordable housing Osio Plaza
project could only be used for this purpose, not for the general fund.

The opposing argument simply confuses the general fund with
other financial requirements of the city. It does not offer one positive
suggestion on how to deal with the projected shortfall.

This five year, % cent increase (that’s merely 250 on a $100
purchase) will benefit every person in Monterey and avoid drastic
cuts. Stop erosion of city services. Please vote YES on Measure K.
