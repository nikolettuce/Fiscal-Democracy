ORDINANCE NO. 98-B

AN ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF INGLEWOOD, CALIFORNIA AMENDING THE TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX
THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY OF INGLEWOOD, CALIFORNIA, DO ORDAIN AS FOLLOWS:

SECTION 1: Section 9-56 of the Inglewood Municipal Code relating to the imposition of a Transient Occupancy
Tax is hereby amended to read as follows:

Section 9-56. Tax Imposed

For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in the
amount of fourteen percent {14%) of the rent charged by the operator. Said tax constitutes a debt owed
by the transient to the City which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the City. The
transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid, if the rent is paid in
installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be
due upon the transient’s ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to
the operator of the hotel, the Tax Administrator may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the Tax
Administrator."

SECTION 2. This ordinance shall become effective on the date provided by the Elections Code of the State of
California.

CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF PROPOSITION 98-B
(Transient Occupancy Tax)

The Transient Occupancy or Hotel Tax is a tax on a person for the occupancy of any hotel or motel room which
occurs in the City of Inglewood. It is commonly referred to as a “visitor-oriented” tax since the burden of the tax falls on the
occupant of the hotel or motel room, often a visitor to the City. The tax has been in effect since 1973.

The proposed Ordinance will increase the tax from 12% to 14% and is expected to result in an increase in revenues
of $266,000 annually. This increase would bring Inglewood’s tax in line with those charged in neighboring localities.
