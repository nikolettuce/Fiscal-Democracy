SAMPLE BALLOT

CITY OF COLUSA

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF CITY MEASURE B

The Colusa City Council has placed Advisory Measure B
on the November 4, 2008 ballot asking the voters whether
the revenue from the transaction and use tax proposed by
Measure A, if Measure A is adopted, should be used to
fund City of Colusa police and fire employee benefits. The
results of the election on Advisory Measure B will not be
controlling upon the City Council, but rather would serve
to advise the City Council regarding the voter’s consensus
on whether the revenue from the proposed transaction
and use tax should be spent to fund City of Colusa police
and fire employee benefits.

A “yes” vote is a vote advising the City Council to use
the revenue from the proposed transaction and use
tax (Measure A) to fund City of Colusa police and fire
employee benefits. A “no” vote is a vote advising the
City Council NOT to use the revenue from the proposed
transaction and use tax to fund City of Colusa police and
fire employee benefits.

Colusa City Attorney

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF CITY MEASURE B

The Colusa Police and Fire employees have formed a
group called the Colusa Public Safety Group (CPSG), and
are asking the public to vote “Yes” on Advisory Measure
B. This will ensure that funds generated by the proposed
Measure A will go directly to improve the salaries and
benefits for these employees. If there are any funds left
over, the CPSG supports the idea of helping out other City
projects that the City Council deems necessary.

According to the City Attorney’s analysis, revenue
generated by the passage of Measure A should be spent
to fund Police and Fire employee benefits. Actually, there
is more to it than that. The funds would be allocated to
improve the low salaries and antiquated retirement plan
that these employees have had to contend with for the
past 30 years. In today’s world, you get what you pay
for. The reality is that in Colusa, Public Safety Employees
have had to change jobs for improved salaries and
benefits. The employee has only to travel across town
to the Sheriff’s Department, 10 miles to Williams or even
25 miles to Yuba City for significant increases in salary
and benefits. Colusa needs to be competitive in the
recruitment and retention of Public Safety Employees.
That’s why this important change is necessary now.

The citizens of Colusa depend on the Police and Fire
departments to keep us safe. A “Yes” vote on Measure
B will help correct a lingering problem that must be
addressed now, not sometime in the future. The Police
and Firefighters need your help even during these difficult
economic times. We are pleading our case to the public in
hopes of your support. Please give us your support.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF CITY MEASURE C

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF CITY MEASURE C

(None Filed)

The Colusa City Council has placed Measure C on the
November 4, 2008 ballot asking voters whether the office
of the City Clerk for the City of Colusa shall be appointed
by the City Council. The office of the City Clerk is currently
an elected position.

The California Government Code provides that the office
of the City Clerk may either be an elected position, or
a position which is appointed by the City Council. An
appointed City Clerk would serve at the pleasure of the
City Council, and would not be required to be a resident
or elector in the City. An elected City Clerk is required to
be a resident and elector in the City.

A “yes” vote is a vote in favor of making the City Clerk an
appointed position. A “no” vote is a vote against making
the City Clerk an appointed position. If a majority of the
voters voting on Measure C vote “yes”, then the City Clerk
will become an appointed position, and the City Council
will appoint a City Clerk at the expiration of the term of the
City Clerk now in office, or upon a vacancy in the office of
the City Clerk.
