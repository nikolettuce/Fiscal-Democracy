MEASURE M

Shall Daly City Ordinance No. 1309, which would authorize the City of Daly City to impose and collect a one-quarter of one percent sales tax
(Transactions and Use Tax) for general government purposes, be approved?

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE M

The Daly City City Council has placed this matter on the ballot for voter
determination. This ballot measure, if adopted by the voters, would enact
Daly City Ordinance 1309 raising revenue for the City of Daly City by
authorizing a one-quarter of one cent (1/40) local sales tax within Daly
City. The sales tax is also referred to as a “transactions and use tax.” The
proposed sales tax would be imposed upon the sale of all tangible personal
property sold at retail within jurisdictional limits of Daly City as well as
upon the storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property
purchased from any retailer in the jurisdictional limits of Daly City. Those
items exempt from existing sales tax would similarly be exempt from this
proposed sales tax.

Under the proposed measure the tax revenue would be put into the City’s
general fund for general City government purposes. General fund money
pays for a wide variety of basic City services including public safety, parks,
libraries, building repairs and road maintenance.

A majority vote of the City’s voters voting in this election is required to
approve this measure. The tax could not be increased in the future except
by another vote of the City’s voters.

A “yes” vote on Measure M is a vote in favor of approving Ordinance 1309.
A “no” vote on Measure M is a vote against approving the Ordinance.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE M

These ballot measures are a chance for us to vote YES for our families, our
community, and our future.

Year after year, Daly City has had to cut staff and services to balance its
budget, while trying to minimize the effects of these cuts on residents. But
the effects of these cuts have become more and more visible. Library hours
have been reduced. Nearly 50 positions are vacant, affecting our police,
firefighting, and emergency medical services. Why? Because the City has
permanently LOST $4 MILLION of our local property tax money to the
State (OVER $40 MILLION IN THE LAST 12 YEARS!).

Recreation programs for youth and seniors have been reduced and fees
have been increased for the programs that remain, creating a burden for
many families. Parks and street maintenance have been cut back, affecting
our property values and the pride we take in our community. Without
additional revenue it is unlikely that any of these local services will return.

Our community deserves better, but there is no way to pay for it.

Your YES vote approving a local one-fourth of one penny sales tax and a
modest business license tax increase will help to provide the badly needed
local services this community needs but has lost. Our community attracts
significant business regionally, so those who shop and conduct business
here will help support critical and needed local services. THESE LOCAL
TAXES WILL STAY IN DALY CITY and help to pay for the public safety,
library, youth, and senior services that this community needs and deserves.

Please join us in voting YES on these important measures.

It is Our Community. Our Services. Our Choice.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE M

Your City Council seems so busy spending money that they don’t have time
to write separate arguments for their proposed tax hikes. In fairness, it is
the same issue: Should we allow the government to take more of our money
in taxes?

We sav ‘NO’!

We have all had to tighten our belts while the economy has been slow. Our
City Council made some cuts, but claims that it still cannot live within its
budget. We elected the City Council to make the hard decisions—where to
cut, and how much. We expect them to decide which services are critical,
and which can be trimmed. Your City Council seems unable do its job, and
choose.

The proposed sales tax would not teach the City Council to live within its
budget. It would teach them that they can always squeeze more money out
of the taxpayers. —All they need to do is claim that we’ve lost “badly
needed services”! The only services that we truly need are emergency
services. The rest are just a wish list.

Citizens must live within their budgets. We expect our government to do
the same.

Vote NO on the new sales tax!

ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE M

Remember the phrase “No new Taxes”!

It was a promise that was not kept; disappointing a tax weary public.

The State of California imposes a 6% sales tax.

Standard county tax adds 1/4% —and there is a 1% local sales tax too.

San Mateo County imposes an additional district sales tax of 1%

That is why we already pay 8.25% in sales taxes.

Now the City Council wants to add another 1/4% that would bring the rate
to 8.5%

The proponents of this measure didn’t say why they want this additional
money in their resolution of July 30, 2004. They just want more money.

They may claim it is for important or critical services, but each election
cycle these claims ring increasingly false. We elect our Council members
to manage the budget of the city and plan ahead. Daly City deserves a
better future than constantly increasing taxes, fees, and bloated
bureaucracy.

Instead of blindly throwing more money at problems, perhaps our civic
leaders should show true leadership by making the cuts necessary to stay
within their budget. Instead of serving on multiple boards and
commissions, perhaps our often-re-elected officials should concentrate on
civic thrift.

Daly City gets revenue from:

Property Taxes,

Sales Taxes,

Vehicle License Fees,

Business License Taxes,

Utility Tax,

Building Permit Fees,

and other sources too numerous to list here.

How much is enough?

If we don’t say ‘no’ now, it will only encourage them to keep coming back
for more.

Vote No on new taxes!

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE M

Opponents of Measure M claim the City has mismanaged our tax dollars.

Let’s look at the facts!

Administrative and clerical costs have been reduced year after year in
proportion to the City’s overall budget by use of technology and other
innovation methods.

Police staffing during nights and weekends had been increased to protect
our homes and businesses, making Daly City one of the ten safest cities of
its size in the nation.

Paramedics were added to the fire department to improve emergency
medical treatment, saving several lives and helping thousands.

Through careful planning and saving, along with acquiring grants, the City
managed to refurbish our neighborhood parks, and replaced aging
community centers and libraries.

Our City had expanded programs for youth and seniors by collaborating
with other agencies and obtaining grants to provide service to thousands of
residents.

Our lives are touched by City services each day. Often, our lives are
touched in ways we don’t see - whether it’s a burglar thwarted by our
police officers, or nutritious meals delivered to a homebound older adult.

Now, due to the State’s grab of our local taxes, public safety and dozens of
other services are being reduced to balance the budget. Our City has fewer
employees than any other similar-sized city in California. We all know it
takes dedicated people to provide quality services.

A “Yes” vote brings back the services and continued improvements that are
so important to all of us!
