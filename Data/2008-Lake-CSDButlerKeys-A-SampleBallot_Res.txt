COMMUNITY SERVICES DISTRICT
MEASURE“A”

California Government Code Section 61121 autho-
rizes the Board of Directors of a county community ser-
vices district to impose a tax for specific purposes. The
Butler-Keys Community Services District adopted a reso-
lution authorizing a special tax within the District for the
maintenance of streets. The resolution, No. FY2007-1, is
effective if approved by two-thirds of those voting on this
ballot measure. The authorizing resolution requires that
the proceeds of this tax be used solely for the purpose of
maintaining streets within the District.

The authorizing resolution provides that a special tax
of no more than forty-five dollars ($45.00) will be levied
on each single lot within the Butler-Keys Community
Services District. The tax will be collected beginning in
fiscal year 2008-2009 and will be listed as a separate
item on the county property tax bill for each parcel of
land. The special tax will be collected in the same way as
the general property tax. All laws applicable to the levy,
collection, and enforcement of county property taxes,
including provisions for penalties and procedure for sale
of the property in case of delinquency, shall also apply to
the special tax. The tax will be imposed for a period of
four (4) years, after which the special tax will expire and
will no longer be collected.

At least two-thirds of those voting on the ballot mea-
sure must approve the measure in order for it to pass.

A “yes” vote is a vote in favor of authorizing the special
tax.

A “no” vote is a vote against authorizing the special tax.
