IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE C
North San Joaquin Water Conservation District
Prepared by the District’s Counsel

If adopted by a majority of voters in the June 2010 election,
Measure C would repeal Section 2 of the Initiative adopted
by Measure V. Section 2 provides as follows:

2. No ground water charges may be imposed or
collected in the fiscal year commencing after the
election at which this initiative is adopted by the
voters, or in any future fiscal year; provided however,
that the District may in any future year submit to the
voters a measure to repeal or amend this initiative.

Section 2 currently prohibits North San Joaquin Water
Conservation District from imposing or collecting a
groundwater charge in fiscal year 2009-2010 and future
years until the District submits the matter to the voters. If
adopted, Measure C will repeal this prohibition and will give
North San Joaquin the ability to impose and collect a
groundwater charge in conformance with all applicable
California laws*

Revenue from the groundwater charge is needed to fund
the construction and maintenance of new and existing
District facilities. Some of these facilities will.be used to
recharge the critically overdrafted San Joaquin
Groundwater Basin. In addition, the revenue generated by
a groundwater charge will be used to finance improvement
projects the District must undertake in order to retain its
current Mokelumne River water right and avoid adjudication •
of the groundwater basin by the State.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE C

aasure C would restore North San Joaquin Water
Conservation District’s authority to impose groundwater
;harges and provide the District with revenue essential for
expanding its present operations. Under Measure C, only
hose properties actually pumping groundwater will pay the
:harge. Other taxpayers who do not own weiis or pump
iroundwater, will not incur any charges as a result of this
neasure.

f passed, Measure C will provide funds to extend existing
lipelines, develop,, recharge sites, and insure district
andowners continue to enjoy a reliable supply of
jroundwater. Unless the District quickly engages in-
neasures to improve groundwater conditions, the State has
hreatened to take over the regulation and use of water
vithin our basin, and strip the District of its surface water
ights. We cannot afford to lose this important right to
vater. Approval of Measure C will keep the State’s hands,
>ff of our water!	®

Currently, pumps pull more water from the groundwater
)asin than naturally occurs through recharge. This
:0ndition, known as a groundwater overdraft, can cause
significant environmental problems. The charge allowed by
Measure C will be used to reverse this adverse
environmental situation by constructing facilities to recharge
9 basin with fresh and healthy water.

Measure C will allow the District to charge a fee on those
vho pump water from the groundwater basin. This fee will
je used to recharge the basin. Those who pay the charge,
ind everyone else living within the District, will benefit from
his investment.

Don’t let the state tell us how and when we can use our
vater. Improve the environment and make sure we have
snough safe water for our farmers and future generations.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE C

Measure C is a tax on water. Vote NO!

Measure C would authorize the North San Joaquin Water
Conservation District to put meters on wells and collect a
tax on every unit of water pumped from the ground.

City residents, our water comes from wells too! The District
hopes to deceive us by saying “only those...pumping
groundwater will pay the charge.” Our suppliers pump
groundwater. They’ll pay the charge, and pass it on to us!

The District hopes to scare us by saying “the State has
threatened to take over.” This District is already regulated
by the State. It’s not “us against the State.” It’s us against
this greedy District.

We don’t benefit by giving this District power to tax us.
According to its Budget, the District will use the tax first to
deliver water free to its own customers (not us), then build a
pipeline to ship water outside the district to the City of
Stockton.

How high will the tax be? The District won’t say. Measure C
is. a blank check!

Water is essential for living. Don’t vote to raise water rates
on seniors and unemployed families, especially when you
don’t know how high the increase could be!

Water is essential for farming. Don’t vote to tax farmers out
of business. You’ll damage the economy further, 'turn
California farmland into bank-owned weed fields, and
increase our dependence on others.

Protect farmers. Protect farmland. Protect seniors and the
unemployed. Protect yourselves. Don’t give this District
unchecked power to tax water. VOTE NO!

Argument in Favor of Measure C

Measure C would restore North San Joaquin Water Conservation District’s authority
to impose groundwater charges and provide the District with revenue essential for
expanding its present operations. Under Measure C, only those properties actually
pumping groundwater will pay the charge. Other taxpayers who do not own wells or
pump groundwater, will not incur any charges as a result of this measure.

If passed, Measure C will provide funds to extend existing pipelines, develop recharge
sites, and insure district landowners continue to enjoy a reliable supply of
groundwater. Unless the District quickly engages in measures to improve
groundwater conditions, the State has threatened to take over the regulation and use
of water within our basin, and strip the District of its surface water rights. We cannot
afford to lose this important right to water. Approval of Measure C will keep the
State’s hands off of our water!

Currently, pumps pull more water from the groundwater basin than naturally occurs
through recharge. This condition, known as a groundwater overdraft, can cause
significant environmental problems. The charge allowed by Measure C will be used to
reverse this adverse environmental situation by constructing facilities to recharge the
basin with fresh and healthy water.

Measure C will allow the District to charge a fee on those who pump water from the
groundwater basin. This fee will be used to recharge the basin. Those who pay the
charge, and everyone else living within the District, will benefit from this investment.

We urge you to vote yes on Measure C.

Don’t let the state tell us how and when we can use our water. Improve the
environment and make sure we have enough safe water for our farmers and future
generations.

Vote YES on Measure C!

Beware of Measure C! Vote NO!

Just when we thought that we, the county’s farmers and city residents, had protected ourselves
from a heavy tax on water, the North San Joaquin Water Conservation District is reaching for
our wallets again.

Three years ago, the District levied a tax on everyone who does NOT receive water from the
District, so that it could give water to its small group of customers for free! We the voters
repealed those outrageous groundwater charges.

But the District won’t take “no” for an answer. Measure C is the District’s attempt to restore its
authority to tax our water use. Measure C is not only unfair, it ignores the will of the voters.

The District claims it needs money to replenish the aquifer. But the District has received a share
of our property taxes every year for 60 years and has done almost nothing to replenish the
aquifer!

The District’s Budget shows how it will spend the money if voters reinstate the groundwater
charge. It will again subsidize die District’s small group of customers (not us). And it will build
a pipeline to ship water outside the district to the City of Stockton. Is it fair to tax our water use
to benefit the District’s customers and Stockton developers?

Farmers, who are hurting because of the recession, use a lot of water. Don’t reinstate an unfair
tax that was costing them thousands of dollars. Driving farmers out of business will only
damage the economy further, and turn fertile farmland into unsighdy weed fields that can be
bought up by developers.

Protect farmers. Protect farmland. Protect yourselves. Don’t levy high taxes on water use to
give money to an agency that only wastes it. VOTE NO on Measure C.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE C

The opposition to Measure C wants you to believe that by voting No you will
be protecting farmers, farmland, and well owners from a "heavy" tax on your
water. None of this is true, v

We all require water, but our groundwater basin is being depleted faster than
natural recharge can occur. Measure C will allow the North San Joaquin
Water Conservation District to place a modest tax on those who pump, and
apply the revenue generated toward developing programs to put water back
into the ground. ($21.40 per household per YEAR is what the opposition calls
"heavy"). If passed, Measure C will allow the District to extend pipelines and
build channels to deliver water to anyone who wants it and can receive it.

Contrary to what the opposition says, there has NEVER been free water for
anyone, and there will NEVER be North San Joaquin Water Conservation
District water for the City of Stockton.

The opposition has no vision for the future. It claims that by eliminating this
small charge, it will keep big government out of your wallet. North San
Joaquin Water Conservation District is not your enemy. It is a board of local
farmers who are concerned that unless we take measures to protect our
valuable resource, the situation will become much worse. The State Water
Resources Control Board has threatened to take over management of our
groundwater basin through adjudication. This would be a catastrophe. State
control of our basin must be avoided.

Vote YES to keep control local. Vote YES to truly help farmers and keep
farmland in production.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE C

The opposition to Measure C wants you to believe that by voting No you will
be protecting farmers, farmland, and well owners from a "heavy" tax on your
water. None of this is true.

We all require water, but our groundwater basin is being depleted faster than
natural recharge can occur. Measure C will allow the North San Joaquin
Water Conservation District to place a modest tax on those who pump, and
apply the revenue generated toward developing programs to put water back
into the ground. ($21.40 per household per YEAR is what the opposition calls
"heavy"). If passed, Measure C will allow the District to extend pipelines and
build channels to deliver water to anyone who wants it and can receive it.

Contrary to what the opposition says, there has NEVER been free water for
anyone, and there will NEVER be NSJWCD water for Stockton.

The opposition has no vision for the future. It claims that by eliminating this
small charge, it will keep big government out of your wallet. NSJWCD is not
your enemy. It is a board of local farmers who are concerned that unless we
take measures to protect our valuable resource, the situation will become
much worse. The State Water Resources Control Board has threatened to
take over management of our groundwater basin through adjudication. This
would be a catastrophe. State control of our basin must be avoided.

Vote YES to keep control local. Vote YES to truly help farmers and keep
farmland in production.
