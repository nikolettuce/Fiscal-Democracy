The current utility users tax provides nearly 1/3 of the tax revenues available for the
City's General Fund. Removal of this tax will dramatically effect thelevel of serviced
provided by this fund. Nearly 2/3 of the General Fund doilars go to provide public safety •
services such as fire and police. Without continued tax support these services will have to
be reduced. For example, last June the City almost closed one of our three fire stations iri
order to balance the budget. This was avoided by generating additional Income from the
utility tax. Unless the current tax revenue is continued we will agairi face such dire choices.

A utility tax is not unusual. For example, Gilroy, With alsighifi<&nt)y larger sales and
commercial tax base has a utility tax. Our tax has an exemption for low income people. &i:\:

For nearly two years Morgan Hill has been struggling with .budget problems. Significant
reductions have been made in order to bring speriding into line. People have been [aid off
and programs reduced or eliminated. Elimination of the tax now, will not teach government
a lesson’ or trim the fat" but will result in real, measurable reductions in essential city
services.	' y;-w •vj >• &Pip :k: ■; ••'

One of the responsibilities of a voter in a democracy is making tough choices at the polls.
Think before you vote against this tax. You may be voting to dose a tire station, eliminate
round the dod< local 911 service, or to dose a local park. Without tax support, these services
can not exist. Make the right choice. Make the responsible choice. Support the tax.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT m FAVOR OF MEASURE F

A no vote on this 9% utility tax, one of the highest in the state, will not throw the city into
financial chaos. A no vote allows the tax to end December 31, 1992 rather than continue
on forever. This time period will give the newly elected council ample time to review the
budget and present any taxes they feel necessary to the voters in November. Hopefully if
there are taxes on the ballot they will have a sunset date and rate cap. We simply can’t
afford to give the city a permanent blank check.

Vote NO on this permanent tax.

ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE F

The members of CAUGHT Again strongly urge a no vote on the question of the Utility
Users Tax.

The Tax was imposed by the city council on July 1, 1991 without voter approval. City
Ordinance No. 325 N.S., Measure A, overwhelmingly passed by the voters of Morgan Hill,
states that "no utility tax may be imposed unless and until such tax is submitted to the
electorate and approved by a majority of the voters1

CAUGHT Again believes that, with the mandate of this ordinance, the present utility tax
is simply not legal. This tax should be rejected by the people and, if a tax is needed,
another measure requesting such tax should be put before the voters. Only now, after
eleven months and a recall, are the wishes of the people being respected by allowing a
vote on this issue. Vote NO because this tax should not be made legitimate,

A sunset clause, which would give an ending date or termination date, for the tax has
not been included in the ballot statement. The wording “beyond December 31, 1992"
specifies that the city will levy this tax forever. Vote NO because the wording of this
jg3£a£ii^aIlo.w^iQr..a permanent, .tax*

"Essential municipal services" are again being used by the city manager and the city
council as a smoke screen and scare tactic to influence a yes vote on this tax. The use of
this threat allowed the city council to justify the imposition of a 9% utility tax, one of the
highest in the state, on the people of Morgan Hill. The people of Morgan Hill want to and
should be informed, not threatened.

Firm in our belief, CAUGHT Again strongly recommends a NO vote.

FRED AMOROSO
Chairman, CAUGHT Again

REBU L *j\L TO ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE

Now that the Utility Users Tax is on the ballot the real question is not whether the tax is
legitimate, but rather, whether the tax is really required.

The Utility Tax is required for the following reasons:

1.	The Utility Tax is one of the few sources of funding available to pay for the police and
fire services which are essential (of the $9.5 million General Fund budget of FY 1991 -
1992, $6.2 million is required for police and fire services).

2.	Stable and reliable City services require a stable source of income. The Utility Tax
provides that stable source.

3.	’‘Breathing room* and time are needed in order to detenmme and develop alternative
sources of income. The Utility Tax can provide an income “bridge’ to fund essential
City services until the City’s sales and property tax base is increased sufficiently to
provide the necessary revenue. (Morgan Hill simply does not have the sales tax and
property tax base that other more established cities have.) When the City’s revenue
base is large enough to achieve a balanced budget, the Utility Tax can be reduced or
eliminated.

Morgan Hill needs the Utility Tax to maintain the level of services which the community
needs and deserves. VOTE YES ON THE UTILITY TAX TO KEEP THESE SERVICES

INTACT.
