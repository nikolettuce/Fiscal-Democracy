GOLD RIDGE FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT
MEASURE U

Shall Ordinance No. 04-05-1 -R of the Gold Ridge Fire Pro-

Utection District (i) authorizing it to impose and levy a new
special tax having a maximum rate of $40.00 per first
dwelling and $20 per additional dwelling for residential
property and $80 per first business and $40 per additional
business for commercial property to assist in meeting costs of
providing services and exercising other rights and powers, and (ii)
increasing appropriations limit to permit spending tax revenues
be approved?

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE U

Please vote yes on Measure U. The Gold Ridge Fire Protection District needs your
support. Because of revenue shifts and shortages experienced by all special dis-
tricts, we are unable to fund two vital, policy-driven programs, apparatus replace-
ment and hiring two full-time fire apparatus engineers.

The apparatus replacement program has been unfunded for eight years with sev-
eral of the fire engines nearing or beyond their twenty year life, which is an industry
standard. The current special tax ($20) which was passed in 1987 and generates
$113,000 annually, is no longer adequate due to inflation, no annual adjustments,
and the rising cost of a fire engine which is $280,000.

Because of increasing call volume and its toll on volunteers, as well as improving
standards and requirements for fire apparatus engineers, full-time fire apparatus
engineers are necessary to staff fire equipment at two stations during the week, al-
lowing volunteers to staff the equipment at night and on weekends.

During the last two years the Gold Ridge Fire Protection District management team
has overhauled and streamlined the budget. Funds have been effectively shifted
from administration and salaries to allow the purchase of tools and equipment as
well as completion of building and equipment maintenance projects, many that had
been deferred for years.

This measure does not utilize the confusing unit of risk equation and is a significant
reduction from the last measure, which was unsuccessful. It seeks $40 per dwell-
ing per year, $20 per additional dwelling on the same property, $80 per business,
$40 per additional business on the same property, and no charge for vacant par-
cels. The levy can (and will) be reduced accordingly if other funding sources are
reinstated.

Our firefighters are very dedicated to training for and responding to emergencies.
Please support their efforts by voting yes on Measure U. www.goldridgefire.org

APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT FOR THE MAXIMUM PERIOD ALLOWED BY LAW
(FOUR YEARS) TO ALLOW USE OF THE PROCEEDS OF THE NEW

SECTION I. DEFINITIONS.

For the purposes of this ordinance, the following words and phrases shall
have the meanings respectively ascribed to them by this section unless the context

Protection District.

“District” means the Gold Ridge Fire Protection District in Sonoma County,
California.

ant to this ordinance. The new special tax is a special tax within the meaning of arti-
cle XIII A, section 4 and article XIIIC, section 1 of the California Constitution.

“Dwelling” means a permanent building or portion thereof, including manu-
factured and mobile homes, designated or used exclusively as a residence, sleep-

tion 13911.

SECTION III. DETERMINATION OF NECESSITY.

The amount of revenue available to the District from property taxes and the
existing special tax is inadequate to meet the cost of providing services pursuant to
Health and Safety Code section 13862. Therefore, the District must establish a
larger stable source of supplementary revenue to assist in meeting the costs of
providing such services and exercising other rights and powers of the District.

SECTION IV. PURPOSE OF NEW SPECIAL TAX.

The purpose for which the new special tax shall be imposed and levied is to
raise revenue for the District to use in meeting the costs of (i) providing services

and powers granted to the District pursuant to Health and Safety Code sections
13860 et seq.

SECTION V. SPECIAL TAX AUTHORIZATION AND LIMIT.
