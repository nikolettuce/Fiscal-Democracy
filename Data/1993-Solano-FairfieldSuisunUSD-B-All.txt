RESOLUTION NO. 33-9293

RESOLUTION PROPOSING A
QUALIFIED SPECIAL TAX AND ESTABLISHING
SPECIFICATIONS OF THE ELECTION ORDER

QUALIFIED SPECIAL TAX - MEASURE B

WHEREAS, increased revenues are necessary to continue meeting the basic
maintenance needs for District classroom facilities; and

WHEREAS, the District has engaged in a variety of efforts to generate funds but
these efforts have not produced sufficient revenues; and

WHEREAS, Section 4 of Article XIIIA of the California Constitution and
Government Code Section 50079 authorize a school district, upon approval of two-thirds of
the electorate voting on the measure, to levy a qualified special tax for specified purposes
following notice and public hearing; and

WHEREAS, this Board believes that such a qualified special tax is necessary to
provide an adequate educational opportunity for the students of this District;

WHEREAS, this Board has held a public hearing after due notice regarding said tax;

and

WHEREAS, the annual appropriations limit of the District should be raised
concurrently for the periods allowed by law to allow the District to expend the amounts
raised by said tax.

THEREFORE, be it resolved that:

1.	This Board hereby proposes to adopt a qualified special tax for the following
specific purposes:	the future modernization, renovation, replacement, and deferred

maintenance of the District's public school facilities, both currently existing and constructed
in the future, excluding District-wide administrative facilities, identified at public hearings
held at least annually.

2.	Said qualified special lax shall be in an amount not to exceed $80.00 per fiscal
year adjusted in June 1994 and every June thereafter for the ensuing fiscal year in accordance
with the annual changes of the most recent Consumer Price Index-San
Francisco/Oakland/San Jose-All Urban Consumers (1982-84 = 100) published by the U.S.
Department of Labor, or its successor or similar index, with the actual levy of twenty-five
percent (25%) of $80.00 for the 1993-94 fiscal year, fifty percent (50%) of the adjusted tax
rate for the 1994-95 fiscal year, seventy-five percent (75%) of the adjusted tax rate for the
1995-96 fiscal year, and one hundred percent (100%) of the adjusted tax rate for the 1996-97
fiscal year and the fiscal years following assessed against each parcel of taxable land in the
District. A parcel shall be defined as any unit of land in the District which receives a
separate tax bill from the Solano and Napa County Assessors' Office; except for the cases in
which a single use, such as a single family dwelling or one business, exists on more than one
assessor's parcel. This determination shall be made by the Superintendent or designee after
written request and an appeal to the Governing Board shall be available. All property which
would otherwise be exempt from property taxes will also be exempt from the imposition of
said special tax.

3.	In connection with the proposal of said special tax, this Board further proposes
initially to increase the District's appropriations limit for four fiscal years in an amount equal
to the levy of special taxes for each of said years as permitted by Article XIIEB, Section 4 of
the California Constitution. The appropriations limit would be submitted to the electorate for
reapproval every four years beginning with November 1996.

4.	This Board hereby requests the Solano and Napa County Clerks ("County
Clerk") to submit to the voters of this District on June 8,1993 the following ballot measure:

existing and constructed in the future, identified at public hearings held at least

annually, excluding District-wide administrative facilities, at a rate of $80.00
per fiscal year adjusted in June 1994 and every June thereafter for the ensuing

resolutions of the District, excluding parcels exempt by law; and, in connection
therewith, shall the appropriations limit of the District be raised for four years

Election and thereafter every four years at each General Election occurring in
November, shall the appropriations limit for the qualified special tax be placed
on the ballot for approval by a majority vote of electors voting at each said
election?"

5.	That the authority for the specifications of this election order is contained in

be.

11.	Subject to two-thirds approval of the voters, the qualified special tax shall be

collector. The tax and penalty shall bear interest at the same rate as the rate for unpaid ad
valorem property taxes until paid.

C June

At the August 13, 1992 School Board meeting, we began discussing a school facilities tax
measure that would appear on the ballot in the spring of 1993.

Since June 1989, when Measure K, our last attempt at a school facilities tax, failed by 5%, the
school district has been active in soliciting public input, refining its needs list, revising its master
plan, and generating more growth-based revenue sources. We now feel ready to advance a new
tax proposal.

We are considering a comprehensive plan split into three parts, which we would call Measures
A, B, and C. Each measure would address a different need, and voters could vote for all three
measures or any combination. Each measure that passes would go into effect.

With our Mello-Roos districts (i.e.. Community Facilities Districts or "CFDs"), particularly
CFD #5, and city mitigation fees, new growth will pay for itself. Measure A-B-C would be
designed to fund our remaining facility needs:

•	Measure A would address our existing facility rehabilitation, replacement, and
modernization backlog;

•	Measure B would create a pay-as-you-go fund to prevent such a backlog from
developing in the future; and

•	Measure C would allow us to accelerate our new school construction program by one
or two years to eliminate overcrowding as we grow.

All of the Measure A-B-C tax money would be spent on facilities; none could be used for district
operations (e.g., teachers' salaries, utility bills, supplies, etc.). And none could be used to build a
new district office.

If all three measures pass, we would have a complete, long-term financial package for school
facilities; one that eventually would relieve us from debt financing of our facilities needs.

If only one or two measures pass, we would only have a partial solution, but by informing the
public of our full needs now, we would hope for greater support in the future.

The "Measure A-B-C" approach would have the following advantages:

•	Provides voters with the opportunity to approve a long-term, comprehensive plan.

•	Separates the issues so we can educate the public more effectively about our facilities
needs.

MEASURE A-B-C FOR SCHOOLS
Page 3

Prohibitions:	Measure	A would not add new school capacity except to replace

antiquated facilities. It also would not be used to fund a new district office.

According to the master plan update. Measure A would need to fund about $44.5 million
in projects (1992 dollars). We would use general obligation bonds supported by a 30-
year district-wide ad valorem tax. The tax rate would average about 40 per year per $100
assessed value. Property owners in CFD #5 would get a substantial discount as required
by the CFD #5 agreements.

MEASURE S - Create Long Jeim CapiiaUmprQ.vemenLf uiid

Measure B would be designed to prevent a facility rehabilitation, replacement, and
modernization backlog from developing in the future. It would create a "pay-as-you-go"
fund for future facility improvement projects to be identified through a public hearing
process. We will need about one to two percent of district facility replacement value put
in the fund each year to do an adequate job.

Measure B would contain a "sunset clause" that requires renewal, by majority vote, every
four years, starting with the November 1996 general election. (Note: Since Measure B
creates a pay-as-you-go fund, it will not rely on long-term borrowing, so a sunset clause
will not create a debt security problem.)

Prohibitions:	Like Measure A, Measure B would not be used to add new school

capacity or to build a new district office.

Measure B would create a district-wide parcel tax, adjusted annually for inflation, of $80
per home per year in 1992 dollars, phased in over four years as follows: 25% in 1993-94,
50% in 1994-95, 75% in 1995-96, and 100% from 1996-97 forward. Nonresidential
property would be taxed at the same rate per parcel as residential property, adding to the
total revenue. Property owners in CFD #5 would participate fully in Measure B.

MEASURE C - Catch-Up. Slay Ahead

Measure C would be designed to put school construction ahead of growth for a change, as
shown in the master plan update. Although our CFD #5 taxes and mitigation fees ensure
growth pays for itself, we usually don't begin receiving the growth revenues until after
new home construction is underway, shortly before the enrollment increases.

State funding is no answer because it is also unavailable in advance (if available at all).
And even when available, state funding only covers 50% of the cost.

Once we have the funding, it often takes one or two years to add the needed classroom
capacity. As a result, we're always trying to catch up, and existing schools become
overcrowded.

BALLOT ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE B

If you believe an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Measure B is for you.

Measure B is the second part of the comprehensive, long-term school facility funding proposal
on.this ballot. It creates a parcel tax that will pay for long-term maintenance of our schools.
While Measure A will solve our existing school improvement backlog, Measure B will protect
our investment and prevent such a backlog from occurring again.

Measure B creates a "pay-as-you-go" fund sufficient to finance all future school improvement
projects without borrowing. The projects will be identified each year through a public hearing
process. Like Measure A, Measure B will not pay for new schools required by growth, a new
district office, or operational costs of the school district.

To ensure accountability. Measure B contains a "sunset clause" that requires the school district to
put it back on the ballot every four years for reaffirmation by majority vote,; starting in
November 1996.	j

Measure B will be phased in over four years. The 1993 tax will be $20 per parcel. Parcel
owners will pay no more than $80 per year in 1993 dollars when Measure B is fully in place.

Measure B makes sense. Well-maintained schools are a community asset. And why invest in
our schools if we aren’t going to protect that investment?

We must take responsibility for the long-term condition of our schools. Join us in voting yes on
Measure B.

NO ARGUMENT AGAINST THIS MEASURE
WAS SUBMITTED

ANALYSIS OF MEASURE B

By Thomas Gordinier, County Counsel

The approval of Measure B would authorize the collection of an annual flat rate parcel tax,
adjusted annually for inflation, on each taxable parcel receiving a tax bill, unless exempted by
law. The purpose of the tax is to fund future modernization, renovation, replacement, and
deferred maintenance of all of the District's public school facilities now in operation and to be
built in the future, except for district-wide administrative facilities. An annual appropriations
limit would also be set by this measure in an amount based on the tax revenues collected.

Each owner of a taxable parcel would pay $20.00 in fiscal year (FY) 1993-94, approximately
$41.00 in FY 1994-95, approximately $64.00 in FY 1995-96, and approximately $87.00 in FY
1996-97. Collection of the tax after FY 1996-97 is contingent on approval by the majority of
voters of the extension of the appropriations limit at the November 1996 General Election.

No debt would be incurred under this measure. The money would be spent annually as collected
after establishment of a list of projects approved by the Governing Board at an annual public
hearing held for that purpose.

The proceeds of the tax cannot be spent for general fund purposes such as administrators' and
teachers' salaries. Salaries of district employees such as maintenance workers engaged in
activities identified in the measure may be paid from the proceeds of the tax. Major work will be
