ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION G

The City and its beach are a State and Regional recreational
resource attraction to tourists. Therefore, the City has to
provide several services directly related to tourist use of City
facilities, such as the pier, parks and the beach. These services
include lifeguards, beach clean-up, parking, streets and traffic,
additional law enforcement, public restrooms, additional trash
collection and maintenance of beach access. Approximately 75% of
the annual 1.7 million tourists are non-residents of the City and
about 30% of general fund expenditures are for tidelands related
services.

The Transient Occupancy Tax which is charged directly on hotel and
motel room rentals is clearly the most direct way to charge
tourists for the impact they have on City services. Raising the
Transient Occupancy Tax from 8% to 10% will raise an additional
$12,600 annually that can be used to help cover the cost of City
tourist related services.

CITY OF IMPERIAL BEACH

CITY ATTORNEY'S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

In the City of Imperial Beach a tax is charged for the
privilege of occupying a hotel room for a period of time no more
than 30 consecutive	days.	This is commonly	referred to as a

Transient Occupancy	Tax.	At the present	time the tax	is

equivalent to 8% of the rent charged for the use of hotel rooms.
The purpose of this measure is to increase the tax to 10% of the
rent charged. This tax applies only to "transient" occupancy of
hotels, which means	the tax is charged only	when a person	is

occupying a hotel room for less than 30 consecutive days. "Hotel"
is defined to include hotels, inns, tourist homes, motels, studio
hotels, bachelor hotels, lodging houses, rooming houses, apartment
houses, dormitories,	public	or private clubs,	mobile homes,	or

similar structures designed for occupancy by transients for
lodging on a short term basis. State law requires majority voter
approval to increase this tax for general governmental purposes.

If this measure is defeated, the Transient Occupancy Tax will
remain at 8%. If approved by a majority of the persons voting on
the measure, this increase in tax to 10% shall take effect on June
15, 1990.

A "YES" vote means you are in favor of the increase of the
Transient Occupancy Tax to 10%; a "NO" vote means you are opposed
to such an increase.
