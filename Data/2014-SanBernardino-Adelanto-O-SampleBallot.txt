MEASURE O
CITY OF ADELANTO

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE O

This Impartial Analysis of Measure O has been prepared by the City
Attorney pursuant to Section 9280 of the California Elections Code.

This measure establishes a temporary utility user tax in the City of Adelanto. A utility
user tax is a legally authorized tax charged on the use of utility services to raise funds
for municipal services. A large number of cities in California currently impose a utility
user tax.

The funds raised by the utility user tax must be used locally to benefit the City of
Adelanto. The funds may be used for any general municipal purposes, including but
not limited to police services, fire protection services, gang and crime prevention, and
other services provided by the City.

The amount of the utility user tax is 7.95% of the charges for the utility service. The
utility user tax would apply to electricity, natural gas (not gasoline for one’s motor
vehicles), communication services (including cell phones and land line telephones),
sewer, water, and cable television charges.

There are a number of specific limitations on the utility user tax and safeguards to
ensure that any funds raised are properly used by the City:

•	The utility user tax will only stay in effect for seven (7) years after it is
adopted. After seven years, the tax is eliminated. The tax can only be
extended by another vote of the people.

•	There is a low income senior discount for any service user that is 65 years old
or older, the head of household, and meets the definition of “very low income”
pursuant to federal standards. The tax rate for those that qualify for the
discount is 5.95%.

•	The City shall annually verify that the funds raised by the utility user tax have
been properly applied, discounted, collected and spent. The annual
verification shall be performed by a qualified auditor and shall employ
reasonable, cost-effective steps to assure compliance.

•	A Citizen Oversight Committee will be created that will review matters
pertaining to the utility user tax and the City’s use of funds derived from the
tax.

•	Each year the Citizen Oversight Committee and City Council may review the
utility user tax rate. The City Council may reduce (but not increase) the tax
rate based upon the financial condition of the City.

A "Yes" vote is in favor of adopting this measure. A “No” vote is against adopting this
measure. If a majority of voters vote “Yes,” then this measure will take effect ten days
after the vote is declared by the City Council. This measure was placed on the ballot
by the City Council.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE O

This Argument in Favor of Measure O was submitted pursuant to Section
9282 of the California Elections Code. It is the opinion of the author(s),
and has been printed exactly as submitted.

The City of Adelanto has the potential to be a great City with its ample space
and preferred logistical location to State highways 18 and 395. The community is filled
with passionate families who care about their schools, parks, and community’s safety.
Citizens are free to walk the streets of the City nightly as they walk their dogs and
participate in youth sports at City parks. With all of that in mind the City of Adelanto is
a community and to remain as such we, as citizens, need to have the financial support
of this tax that is levied by us and controlled by us, with no interference or threat of the
State or County taking the money. With the approval, we as Citizens can dictate to the
City Council our wishes for how it is to be used.

Adelanto has been ignored by commercial retailers historically and we have
been forced to drive to neighboring cities for services, only to have the sales tax
dollars benefit those cities and not Adelanto. A positive response to the passing of this
tax sends a message to the commercial retailers that we care enough about our
community to do our part to maintain and take care of it.

Additional revenue can help City management address our concerns for more
amenities to keep us in Adelanto and not be forced to seek entertainment and
amenities elsewhere. During the downturn in the economy, many of us have stayed
with hopes of eventually continuing on the path of being the great community that
attracted all of us here originally. Namely, affordable housing, a small town sense of
community and pride, and the potential to be a part of a newly emerging, vibrant and
innovative City who prides itself on sensible and responsible growth.
