Impartial analysis

The following impartial analysis of the measure was prepared by the office of the Del

Rey Oaks City Attorney:

The City of Del Rey Oaks has placed this measure on the ballot to ask the
voters of Del Rey Oaks to approve an ordinance to the Del Rey Oaks
Municipal Code imposing a cannabis business tax on cannabis
(marijuana) businesses which operate in the City. The ordinance
authorizes the City Council to set a maximum tax rate often percent
(10%) of gross receipts but sets the initial tax rate at five percent (5%) of
gross receipts. The ordinance broadly defines “cannabis business” to
include any for-profit or nonprofit business which distributes, delivers,
dispenses, exchanges, barters or sells either medical or non-medical
cannabis and includes, but is not limited to, medical marijuana
cooperatives and businesses, and any other business which transports,
manufactures, compounds, converts, processes, prepares, stores,
packages, sells at wholesale, or sells at retail, cannabis or products made
of cannabis. The tax is a gross receipts tax imposed on cannabis
businesses and is not a sales tax imposed on qualified patients, primary
caregivers or other persons who purchase or otherwise acquire cannabis
for their personal use. All cannabis business tax revenue will be deposited
in the City’s General Fund. General Fund revenue is used by the City to
pay for the provision of municipal services to City residents and visitors
including the provision of essential City services. Because the proposed

cannabis business tax would be imposed for general municipal
governmental purposes, the ballot measure proposes a “general tax” as
defined by Article XIII of the California Constitution. Accordingly, for the
ballot measure to be adopted, it must receive a simple majority (over 50%)
“YES” vote.[2]
