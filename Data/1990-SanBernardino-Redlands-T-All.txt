so collected has either been refunded to the service user or credited to charges
subsequently payable by the service user to the person required to collect and remit.

jurisdiction, makes a refund to serve its users of charges for past utility service, the taxes
paid pursuant to this Chapter on the amount of such refunded charges shall also be
refunded to service users, and the service suppliers shall be entitled to claim a credit
for refunded taxes against the amount of tax which is due upon the next monthly returns.

declare facts under penalty of perjury which qualify the applicant for the exemption.

Upon receipt of notice from the Director, the service provider shall not be required

further notice from the Director.

E.	Each exemption shall expire twelve months after the date it was issued. The Director

of those service users who have not applied for renewal of their exempt status or whose
applications for renewal have been denied. Upon receipt of the written notification, these
service providers shall resume such collection on those accounts affected commencing
with the first billing period beginning after the exemption expires.

Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this section, any service supplier who
determines during any calendar year by any means readily available to it that a

service supplier shall forthwith resume the collection of taxes imposed by this Chapter
upon the nonexempt service user.

F.	Any individual who has been exempted from the tax shall notify the Director within ten

supplier who shall resume collection of the tax imposed by this Chapter commencing
with the next billing period, if the user is entitled to exemption at a new address, the

exemptions provided by this section when the basis for the exemption either does not
exist or ceases to exist.

service user for exemption under the provisions of this section. Such evidence may
include copies of business records, letters or statements from the Social Security
Administration, copies of income tax returns, and other evidence concerning the service
user or members of his household which may tend to prove or disprove eligibility. Failure
to provide sufficient evidence to establish eligibility when requested by the Director shall
be grounds for denial or discontinuance of the service users’ exemption, but evidence
voluntarily provided to the Director may only be used as grounds for termination of the
exemption and not as evidence of violation of the provisions of this section.

If the Director determines that an application for exemption is faulty or untruthful, the
application shall be denied in writing and the applicant may file an amended application
or appeal the decision of the Director to the City Manager, whose decision shall be final.

J5UMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE

Measure R will provide up to $38,500,000 for the construction
facility in the Redlands Unified School District.

• “R”||
of a sect

6nd high school

The Redlands Unified School District has applied for and will continue to actively pursue
funding through the State “Advanced Construction" (50/50) program. If the district receives
the 50% state funding, the bond issue will be reduced by the amount of money received
from the state.

Redlands High School has exceeded capacity and expects over 1,200 additional students
over the next five years. Without a second high school campus, the high school will be
forced to go on double session.

This bond issue will fund the construction of the high school facility which will include
classrooms, a gymnasium, a small auditorium, a cafeteria, athletic fields and a swimming
pool. The bond issue amount DOES NOT include the cost of the land, which is being funded
through the sale or trade of other district-owned property.

The Board of Education is committed to offering equal opportunities to all high school
students in the district. Vote for quality education. Vote Yes on Measure R.

ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY*

This initiative ordinance, if approved by the voters, will allow the City to impose a two
and one-half percent (2-1/2%) tax on utility use. The proceeds of the tax will be used to
defray the costs of providing City services and to supplement the City's general fund.

The tax will be imposed on telephone, cable television, electric and natural gas services.
The tax will be collected on the utility provider’s utility bills, and will be paid by the utility
user. The tax will be remitted to the utility company, which in turn will make periodic
disbursements to the City.

Senior citizens over 65 years of age and certain low income utility users are exempt from
payment of the tax. These users must file yearly exemption claims with the City

demonstrating the basis for exemption.

This initiative ordinance will become effective upon a "yes” vote of a majority of the
persons voting in this election.

"Section 5321 of the Elections Code requires County Counsel to prepare an Impartial analysis of measures appearing on the
ballot.

The City of Redlands continues to face a severe financial crisis resulting in its having
to search out innovative methods of developing revenue to meet the escalating costs of
the services it provides to its residents. During the past decade, the costs of providing
necessary and expected services to the community has increased dramatically.
Unfortunately, the revenue generated by the City has not kept pace with the costs of doing
business. Consequently, it is necessary to cafl upon the voters of this community to assist
in maintaining and funding the high quality service provided by City government

The funds generated from this Measure will supplement the City's General Fund and
will be used to finance all essential City services. As matters presently stand, the likelihood
of future reductions in services would have to be considered if alternative revenue sources
are not developed.

This ballot measure protects qualifying senior citizens and low.income residents who
wish to file for exemption, in this manner, those who cannot afford the tax will not be
required to pay. The reluctance to increase taxes is commonly shared; however, this
modest 2.5 percent utility tax will guarantee that the City will be able to continue its present
course of insuring that its residents are able to enjoy the high quality of life they are entitled
and accustomed to.

We urge a “YES" vote on Measure (T).
