CITY ATTORNEY S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS FOR
INITIATIVE TO LIMIT UTILITY USERS TAX
MEASURE P

An initiative to reduce the City's utility users tax has been
presented to the City of Pacific Grove and has qualified for
placement on the November 5, 2002 ballot for consideration by
the voters of the City of Pacific Grove. The initiative would
amend five sections of the Pacific Grove Municipal Code to
reduce the utility users tax, first adopted by the City in 1968,
from five percent to three percent of the charges for the
following utilities: telephone, electricity, gas (delivered through
mains or pipes), water and cable television. Certain persons,
including very low income and disabled persons, can currently
obtain an exemption from payment the tax. This initiative
would not change that exemption.

Currently, the utility users tax accounts for approximately nine
percent of the City's total General Fund revenue. General
Fund revenues are used to provide many general City services
such as police and fire protection, public works, recreation, and
general administration.

If approved by a majority of the voters voting on the measure,
this ordinance will take effect 10 days following the date on
which the City Council declares the results of the election.
However, the reduction in the utility users tax will take effect on
January 1,2003.

If the initiative is approved, Pacific Grove utility users will pay
a three percent utility users tax beginning on January 1, 2003.
It the initiative is approved, the City will receive approximately
$400,000 less in annual tax revenues for the payment of
general governmental activities than it would receive if the
initiative is not approved. If the initiative is not approved, the
City will continue collecting the utility users tax, and the City will
continue to receive tax revenues at the same tax rate as it has
since 1968.

Because the City is limited in its ability to raise revenues from
other sources without voter approval, approval of the initiative
will likely require Pacific Grove to cut its general fund
expenditures by $400,000, which will result in the reduction or
elimination of some City programs.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE P UTILITY TAX RELIEF INITIATIVE  A "YES" vote means tax relief for struggling families, small businesses, senior citizens, churches, nonprofit organizations, and people at almost all income levels.  Years ago, when the tax was increased from 3% to 5%, it was done by a vote of the city council rather than by a vote of the people. This ballot measure reduces the utility tax from 5% to the original 3%.  This tax savings is rightfully our own money. We should be free to spendour money as we wish.  This tax is added to our bills for gas. electricity, water, cable, and telephone services; it is not restricted to being spent on utilities or on any specific city service. It can be spent - or misspent - any way the City Council chooses.  This tax money can be spent on employee salaries, administrative costs and expensive consultant reports. For example, the City Manager's monthly salary is currently $12,096, which is over $145,000 annually, and includes a 10.25% pay increase this year. His additional benefits cost taxpayers even more.  The pro-tax advocates may say they need the money, but don't governments always say that, no matter how much or your money they get? The fact is that more than 300 cities throughout California balance their budgets and provide vital services WITHOUT a utility users tax on their residents and businesses.  Governments can cut expenses and provide services more efficiently if they are motivated to do so.  Your "YES" vote on Measure P to reduce the utility users tax is thaTmotivation.  s/ David R. Henderson, Economics Professor  s/ Robert S. Oliver, Retired  s/ Virginia M. Oliver, Retired  sJ Patricia Herrgott, Retired  s/ Edwin C. Larson, MSGT US ARMY (RET)  REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE P  Please take a minute to consider the effects of loosing over $400,000 from our City's service budget. The five dollars a month we spend on utility taxes goes directly to Pacific Grove's fire and police services, our library and museum, and to maintaining our precious open spaces.  Other taxes are shared by state, county, and special districts that provide services outside of Pacific Grove. With the possibility of state funding cuts, lower revenues due to stagnant economy, and an aging infrastructure, this is no time to reduce city revenue.  A NO VOTE is essential to continue the level of services we now enjoy.  The utility tax was originally approved at 3% in 1968, and changed to 5% iust a year later. It has remained the same for over 35 years. This is a reasonable investment that allows us the qualify of life we currently enjoy.  A No vote on Measure P is a vote to preserve the heritage, environment, beauty, and our basic services.  s/ Richard Stillwell, Resident  s/ Alan Cohen, Chairman P.G. Chamber  s/ Craig Riddell  s/ Donald T. Gasperson  s/ Eleanor C. Rogge, Resident	ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE P  Pacific Grove Needs Utility Users Tax to Ensure Quality of Life  Five dollars pgr rqonth! That is the estimated average savinqs per household if this measure passes. While most or us could use an extra $5 per month, what are we willing to give up for it?  Our five dollars per month helps pay for police, fire and emergency services, and maintenance of our city's parks, playgrounds, shoreline and roads.  Our five dollars per month helps pay for our city's library, youth center, street cleaning, and beautification.  Five dollars per month won't buy much for an individual household, but it adds up to more than $400,000 annually for the City of Pacific Grove. Unlike other taxes paid by residents and visitors of Pacific Grove that must be shared with county, state and other agencies, 100% of the money raised by utility taxes is used to pay for programs and services in our city!  This assessment is fair and equitable. Those who use less utilities pay less. Low-income households, such as seniors on fixed incomes, receive an exemption. Remember, this assessment is per household, not per person.  This revenue is predictable. Many of the City of Pacific Grove's revenue sources, such as sales or transient occupancy tax, can diminish during difficult economic periods such as those we have recently experienced.  Pacific Grove is challenged each year to match our revenues to the many needs in our community. With the possibility of state funding cuts, lower revenues and increasing infrastructure needs, this is not the time to reduce city revenues!  Please VOTE NO on this utility initiative! We must each do our part to preserve the heritage, environment, beauty and services that make Pacific Grove such a wonderful place to live.  Thank you for your consideration.  s/ Craig Riddell, Resident  s/ Don Gasperson, City Councilmember  s/ Alan Cohen, Chairman Pacific Grove Chamber of Commerce  s/ Richard Stillwell, Resident  s/ Eleanor C. Rogge, Resident  REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE P UTILITY TAX RELIEF INITIATIVE  Vote YES to decrease the utility users tax to 3% and the average household will save an estimated $75 a year. Small businesses will save considerably more.  We all love the peaceful environment, magnificent coastline and historic treasures of Pacific Grove. That's not at issue.  The real issue is who owns your money and who does a better job of spending it.  The recent gas and electricity price increases provided our City with close to $270,000 in additional utility taxes. Did the Council use this windfall to pave streets or speed up sewer-line replacements?  No. In fact, our Council tried to cut funds for infrastructure repair while approving high pay increases for employees. Moreover, even as the City population has declined, the number of City employees has increased. In 1995, the City had 121 full time employees; today there are 180 full and permanent part-time employees. Surely a well-paid City Manager should be able to earn his $145,000 salary by using this staffmore effectively.  When the City Council spends money the way this one does, it's time to cut their allowance.  There is a utility tax exemption for low-income residents, but it is not automatic. To qualify, your household income cannot exceed $12,000 a year and you must prove it by letting government officials pore over your personal financial records.  Vote YES to reduce the utility tax. Vote YES for fiscal accountability.  s/ David R. Henderson, Economics Professor s/ Edwin C. Larson, MSGT US ARMY (RET.) s/ Virginia M. Oliver, Retired s/ Robert S.
