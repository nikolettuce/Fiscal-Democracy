IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL
REGARDING FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
ADVISORY MEASURE C

Advisory Measure “C” is ADVISORY ONLY. This means that neither the State, nor the County, nor
any other legislative body is bound by the decision of the voters. The purpose of this Advisory Measure
is to ascertain whether the voters of Inyo County wish the State to pay for certain State-mandated
functions which are now paid for in part or whole by the County. These programs include Welfare,
Health, the Court and the Jail. A “yes" vote on this Measure means that the voter is in favor of
the State assuming financial responsibility for these systems.

A “no" vote on this Measure means that the voter is against the State assuming the financial respon-
sibility for the above-mentioned programs.
