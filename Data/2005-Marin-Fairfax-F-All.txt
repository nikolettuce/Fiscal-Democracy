IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY TOWN ATTORNEY	ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF
MEASURE F	MEASURE F
This measure, if passed by two-thirds (2/3) of the voters, would add Sections 3.20.080 and 3.20.090 to the Fairfax Town Code, imposing a special tax at a maximum rate of one hundred twenty-five dollars ($125.00) on each improved residential and business parcel within the boundaries of the town of Fairfax for a period of five (5) years. The measure requires that the revenue from the tax be used exclusively for the specific purposes of maintaining 24-hour, seven days per week staffing of the Fairfax Police Station and Fire House, maintaining Fairfax's 911 Emergency Dispatch, performing Public Works safety improvements, restoring funding for Youth Services and establishing a citizens’ oversight committee to ensure that the tax revenue is spent accordingly.	THE FAIRFAX WE KNOW AND LOVE IS THREATENED  In recent years, Sacramento has diverted $2,800,000 in Fairfax tax dollars while balancing its budget on the backs of local governments. Consequently, Fairfax's ability to provide outstanding and cost effective Fire and Police protection, to attract money for road, pedestrian and bicycle improvements, and to provide youth services, is in peril.  Imagine Fairfax without its own Fire and Police departments. Picture Fairfax patrolled by Sheriffs cruisers from Kentfield or protected by fire crews responding from Woodacre. Unimaginable!
The remaining sections of Chapter 3.20 of the Fairfax Town Code shall remain unchanged.	Think how tragic it would be to lose $750,000 in already approved grants for roads and Safe Routes to School improvements because we couldn't afford the 10% matching funds. Or if we couldn't restore our modest
