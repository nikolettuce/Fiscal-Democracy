CITY OF COALINGA
UTILITY USERS TAX MEASURE P

To preserve the safety and quality of life of the citizens of the City of Coalinga, shall
the City enact a Utility Users Tax in the amount of 5.5%, with certain exemptions for
businesses and low income seniors, with all revenues dedicated to finance public safety
services such as law enforcement, fire protection, and emergency medical response?

YES OR NO

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY

Measure P asks voters whether the City of Coalinga should adopt a Utility Users Tax at
the rate of five and one-half percent (5.5%) on electricity, gas, communications (including
mobile telecommunications and video), water, sewer, and refuse collection. If approved,
the Utility Users Tax would be implemented through Ordinance No. 14-777, which was
approved by the City Council on July 17, 2014. As a special tax, Measure P must be
approved by two-thirds (2/3) of the voters.

Proceeds from the tax will be placed in a special fund and can only be used to fund law
enforcement, fire protection, and emergency medical response services. The proceeds
of the tax cannot be used by the City for other purposes.

Measure P provides an exemption from the electricity users tax for businesses and low
income seniors upon approval of an application. Measure P also includes a provision
permitting the City Council to establish, by resolution, additional exemptions applicable
to one or more classes of persons or services. The Council is required to review the
tax annually and determine if a reduction in the amount of the tax is warranted and may
pass a resolution reducing the tax for the twelve (12) month period. Reductions may be
made for consecutive twelve (12) month periods. The Council can also repeal the tax in
its entirety. Council may not increase the tax without returning to the voters.

Taxes are to be collected by the utilities providing theses services along with regular bills
to customers. There are provisions requiring the reporting and remitting of taxes to the
City and penalties for failing to collect or remit taxes as required in the Ordinance. There
are administrative remedies and a penalty of ten percent (10%) for failing to pay taxes,
with the right to appeal to the City Manager. The Ordinance requires persons who collect
and remit taxes to the City to keep records of their collection and remittance activities,
with the Tax Administrator having the right to inspect such records. Tax Refunds are
authorized where taxes were mistakenly or illegally paid, or where the claimant overpaid
taxes or paid taxes more than once.

THE ABOVE STATEMENT IS AN IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE P. IF YOU
DESIRE A COPY OF THE FULL UTILITY USERS TAX ORDINANCE, PLEASE CALL
THE ELECTIONS OFFICE AT (559) 600-8683 AND A COPY WILL BE MAILED AT NO
COST TO YOU.

City Attorney

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE P

Measure P is a proposed utility user tax necessary to maintain the current level of public
safety services (police, fire and emergency medical services) in our community.

•	100% of Measure P proceeds will support public safety services

•	Measure P is a 5.5% tax on utility services, or $5.50 for every $100, paid for water,
natural gas, sewer, sanitation and recycling, electricity, telephone and cellular
services, internet, and television services.

•	Measure P exempts people over the age of 65 and participating in the C.A. R. E.
program through PG&E from the electricity portion of the tax

•	Measure P exempts businesses from the electricity portion of the tax

•	Measure P requires the Council to review the tax annually

•	Measure P allows the Council to annually adjust the tax rate

•	Measure P does not allow the tax rate to increase without voter approval

•	Measure P gives the Council the ability to repeal the tax in the future

• Measure P is necessary due to a loss in General Fund revenue following the
closure of the Claremont Custody Center three years ago, which also cost the
City’s General Fund almost $2.9 million to close

•	The City’s “rainy day” reserve fund in the General Fund has been depleted

•

The choice is ours, Coalinga.

Pass this tax and our public safety services will remain the same. If, we do not pass
this tax, portions of our public safety services will be outsourced to reduce General Fund
expenses
