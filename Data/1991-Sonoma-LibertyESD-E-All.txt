IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL
LIBERTY SCHOOL DISTRICT

State law requires school districts to have voter approval before imposing
special taxes for school purposes. The Governing Board of the Liberty School
District has called for such an election.

If two-thirds of the Liberty School District voters who vote on the measure
vote for approval, the District will be authorized to levy a special tax of $45
per year per parcel for each parcel of land within the District's boundaries.
The tax is based on the privilege of using the parcel, and will remain in effect
for seven fiscal years beginning July 1,1992. Proceeds of the tax would be
used for replacing substandard classroom structures and reinstatement of
educational programs.

The measure exempts multiple contiguous parcels used as one economic
unit under the same name and ownership: those parcels would be taxed as
one parcel. Persons claiming such exemption must apply to the District by
May 1 preceding any fiscal year in which the exemption is claimed.

The measure also provides that the spending limit of the District would be
increased by the amount of revenue generated by the tax. Voter approval of
the change in the spending limit permits the District to keep and spend money
raised by the new tax.	:f

, if two-thirds of the voters in the Liberty School District who vote on this
measure vote “yes," the measure will pass and the special tax will be levied.
The tax would be collected in the same manner as regular property taxes
starting with the 1992-1993 fiscal year.
