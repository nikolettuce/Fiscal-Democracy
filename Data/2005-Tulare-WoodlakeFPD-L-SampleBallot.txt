IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL

MEASURE L INCREASED FUNDING FOR FIRE EMERGENCY SERVICES.

To prevent threatening delays in emergency and fire fighting response and lowering the staffing
of firefighters of the District fire station, shall the District increase the special tax by $22.60 per
year which equates to $1.88 per month for a single unit dwelling and which shall increase
annually thereafter in the same percentage as the Consumer Price Index, thus maintaining a full
strength local fire department that insures rapid emergency response, protection of lives and
property?

Section 4 of Article XIIIA of the California Constitution, and Government Code section 50075

WOODLAKE FIRE PROTECTION DISTRIC

special tax on the secured tax roll commencing in the 2006-2007 fiscal year. The tax allocation
per parcel will be the same allocation as used by the District under its existing tax. The tax
increase for a parcel with a single unit dwelling will equate to an increase of $22.60 per year.
The tax may be adjusted each fiscal year in accordance with the average increase, if any, in the
Consumer Price Index for the previous two year period, but the District may levy the tax in an
amount which is less than the maximum amount authorized. The special tax shall be fixed and
collected in the same manner as ad valorem property taxes are fixed and collected under
provisions of the California Revenue and Taxation Code.

The measure’s stated purpose is to preserve the existing equipment and staff levels in the
District for emergency response, fire protection, fire fighting, and hazardous materials services.

The measure makes no change to existing law. The electors entitled to vote on this measure are
the registered voters within the boundaries of the District. If the measure is not approved by at
least two-thirds of the votes cast on the measure, the measure will fail and the special tax will
not be implemented.
