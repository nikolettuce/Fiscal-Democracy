AN URGENCY ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF LAGUNA BEACH
IMPOSING A TEMPORARY TRANSACTIONS (SALES) AND USE TAX
TO BE ADMINISTERED BY THE STATE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION

The City Council of the City of Laguna Beach does hereby ordain as follows:

Section 1. Title. This Ordinance shall be known as the City of Laguna Beach
Temporary Sales and Use Tax Ordinance.

Section 2.	Operative date. "Operative date" means July 1,2006.

Section 3.	Purpose. This Ordinance is adopted to achieve the following, among other

purposes, and directs that the provisions hereof be interpreted in order to accomplish those
purposes:

(a)	To impose a retail transactions (sales) and use tax in accordance with the
provisions of Part 1.6 (commencing with Section 7251) of Division 2 of the Revenue and
Taxation Code and Section 7285.9 of Part 1.7 of Division 2 of said Code, which authorizes the
City to adopt this tax Ordinance, which shall be operative if a majority of the electors voting on
the measure vote to approve the imposition of the tax at an election called for that purpose.

(b)	To adopt a retail transactions (sales) and use tax ordinance that
incorporates provisions identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the State of California
insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and limitations contained
in Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.

(c)	To adopt a retail transactions (sales) and use tax ordinance that imposes a
tax and provides a measure therefore that can be administered and collected by the State Board

130/053733-0487

642641.01	a09/16/05

of Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as practicable to, and requires the least
possible deviation from, the existing statutory and administrative procedures followed by the
State Board of Equalization in administering and collecting the California State Sales and Use
Taxes.

(d)	To adopt a retail transactions (sales) and use tax ordinance that can be
administered in a manner that will be, to the greatest degree possible, consistent with the
provisions of Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of
collecting City sales and use taxes, and at the same time, minimize the burden of record keeping
upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this ordinance.

Section 4. Contract with state. Prior to the operative date, the City shall contract
with the State Board of Equalization to perform all functions incident to the administration and
operation of this temporary sales and use tax ordinance; provided, that if the City shall not have
contracted with the State Board of Equalization prior to the operative date, it shall nevertheless
so contract and in such a case the operative date shall be the first day of the first calendar quarter
following the execution of such a contract.

Section 5. Transactions (Sales) tax rate. For the privilege of selling tangible personal
property at retail, a tax is hereby imposed upon all retailers in the incorporated area of the City at
the rate of one-half of one percent (0.5%) of the gross receipts of any retailer from the sale of all
tangible personal property sold at retail in the City on and after the operative date of this
Ordinance.

Section 6. Place of sale. For the purposes of this Ordinance, all retail sales are
consummated at the place of business of the retailer unless the tangible personal property sold is
delivered by the retailer or his agent to an out-of-state destination or to a common carrier for

130/053733-0487

642641.01	a09/16/05

-2-

delivery to an out-of-state destination. The gross receipts from such sales shall include delivery
charges, when such charges are subject to the state sales and use tax, regardless of the place to
which delivery is made. In the event a retailer has no permanent place of business in the State or
has more than one place of business, the place or places at which the retail sales are
consummated shall be determined under rules and regulations to be prescribed and adopted by
the State Board of Equalization.

Section 7. Use tax rate. An excise tax is hereby imposed on the storage, use or other
consumption in the City of tangible personal property purchased from any retailer on and after
the operative date of this ordinance for storage, use or other consumption in the City at the rate
of one-half of one percent (0.5 %) of the sales price of the property. The sales price shall include
delivery charges when such charges are subject to state sales or use tax regardless of the place to
which delivery is made.

Section 8. Adoption of provisions of state law. Except as otherwise provided in this
Ordinance and except insofar as they are inconsistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of Division
2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, all of the provisions of Part 1 (commencing with Section
6001) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code are hereby adopted and made a part of
this Ordinance as though fully set forth herein.

Section 9. Limitations on adoption of state law and collection of use taxes. In
adopting the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code:

(a)	Whenever the State of California is named or referred to as the taxing agency, the
name of this City shall be substituted therefor. However, the substitution shall not be made
when:

130/053733-0487

642641.01	a09/16/05

Treasurer, State Board of Control, State Board of Equalization, State Treasury, or the
Constitution of the State of California;

(2)	The result of that substitution would require action to be taken by or against
this City or any agency, officer, or employee thereof rather than by or against the State Board of
Equalization, in performing the functions incident to the administration or operation of this
Ordinance.

(3)	In those sections, including, but not necessarily limited to sections referring to
the exterior boundaries of the State of California, where the result of the substitution would be
to:

(A)	Provide an exemption from this tax with respect to certain sales,
storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property which would not otherwise be
exempt from this tax while such sales, storage, use or other consumption remain subject to tax by
the State under the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, or;

(B)	Impose this tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use or other
consumption of tangible personal property which would not be subject to tax by the state under
the said provision of that code.

(4)	In Sections 6701, 6702 (except in the last sentence thereof), 6711, 6715,

6737, 6797 or 6828 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.

in connection with the actual and threatened conditions of disaster and extreme peril to the safety
of persons and property within the City, caused by a landslide that occurred on that day in the
Bluebird Canyon area, resulting in the destruction of and damage to public infrastructure as well
as to numerous residences. The City Council subsequently has determined that this local
emergency continues to exist, and also has determined to commit certain funds to forestall, halt,

130/053733-0487

642641.01	a09/16/05

stabilize and/or abate the conditions constituting the local emergency and to restore destroyed
and damaged public infrastructure. These commitments, coupled with the need to undertake
remediation efforts on an expedited basis, will necessitate immediate budget cuts in the City's
General Fund, to which the proposed ballot measure is directed.

PASSED, APPROVED AND ADOPTED ON SEPTEMBER 16,2005.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE A

On June 1, 2005, Laguna Beach suffered the latest in a series of disasters that has
plagued our city over the past 30 years. Our town responded magnificently, taking
the families who saw their homes lost or damaged into their homes and into their
hearts.

The City of Laguna Beach is now required to replace over $15 million of streets,
sewers and storm drains lost in the Bluebird Canyon slide. The City Council has
carefully examined the city budget to find areas to cut. By drastically cutting
projects and instituting a hiring freeze, $7 million has been found.

To fund the remaining $8 million in repairs to city property, your City Council is
proposing a temporary emergency sales tax. This tax will be Vi percent (a quarter
on a $50 purchase). Much of this tax will be paid by visitors to our city.

If we do not pass this tax, we will not be able to fill vacant police, fire and
lifeguard positions, and we will delay critical projects such as the Village Entrance
Parking Structure, the Senior/Community Center, and street repaving.

This tax will automatically end six years after it is passed. It cannot be extended
by the City Council.

No part of the tax will be used to rebuild private homes - it will be used only for
repairs to public property and to establish a disaster fund for any future
emergencies within the City of Laguna Beach.

Please join us in voting to preserve Laguna’s special quality of life.

FISCAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE A

On June 1 of this year, a devastating landslide occurred in Bluebird Canyon. Eleven homes were
destroyed and thirteen houses were badly damaged. City streets, storm drains and sewers were
similarly destroyed or damaged. Additional homes and public facilities would have been
damaged had the City not taken prompt action to temporarily stabilize the hillside. The City has
also restored drainage along Bluebird Creek in an effort to avoid further damage during the
upcoming rainy season. The cost estimate for these emergency measures is about $7 million.

In addition, the City must restore Flamingo Road, which is a City street that provides access to
four undamaged houses. Restoring Flamingo Road also will provide an emergency exit out of
Bluebird Canyon in the event of a fire, mudslide, earthquake or other event that blocks Bluebird
Canyon Road. Because Flamingo Road dropped 40 feet as a result of the landslide, rebuilding
the public street along with sewers and storm drains will be costly - between $5 million to $8
million in addition to the $7 million for the emergency measures. That project will start next
spring.

Each year, the City has about $30 million to spend on general services and capital projects,
which include police, fire, paramedics, lifeguards, animal control, streets, parks, storm drains,
stairways, etc. Spending $12 million to $15 million to replace public facilities that were
destroyed by the Bluebird Canyon landslide will reduce or eliminate certain general City services
and capital projects for several years unless some financial aid is available.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has refused to provide any disaster
assistance to Laguna Beach. The City is appealing that decision. However, even if the City
receives Federal or possibly State disaster aid, it would only cover a fraction of the total cost.

Each year, a 1/2% sales tax should generate about $1.7 million which will be used only in
Laguna Beach, not for County or State functions. This tax measure will automatically end in six
years. The temporary sales tax increase would allow the City to continue with most municipal
services and capital projects in the face of the expense of the landslide. Also, while the proceeds
of the tax legally cannot be earmarked for specific purposes, the City Council has expressed its
intention to create a contingency fund for future disasters given that Laguna Beach is prone to
landslides, mudslides, floods and wildland fires.

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY

MEASURE A
City of Laguna Beach
Temporary Sales and Use Tax

TEMPORARY (SIX YEAR) ONE-HALF PERCENT SALES TAX INCREASE

This ballot measure, if adopted by the voters, would enact a temporary one-half of one
percent (0.5%) increase to the sales tax rate in the City of Laguna Beach. The sales tax
increase would be effective for a period of six years, commencing on July 1, 2006 and
expiring on June 30, 2012. However, the ballot measure empowers the City Council, in
its discretion, to terminate the sales tax increase at any time prior to the expiration date.

The current sales tax rate in the City of Laguna Beach is seven and three-quarters percent
(7.75%). Thus, if this ballot measure is adopted, the sales tax rate would increase to eight
and one-quarter percent (8.25%) for a period of six years, unless earlier terminated by the
City Council. The proposed sales tax increase would be administered and applied in the
identical manner as the current sales tax.

All revenue generated from the proposed sales tax increase would be deposited into the
City's General Fund and, accordingly, all monies collected pursuant to the sales tax
increase would be appropriated and used by the City to pay for general City operations
and services. /I/j A t +
