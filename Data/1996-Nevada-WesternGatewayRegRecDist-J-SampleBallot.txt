COUNTY COUNSEL’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF
MEASUREJ

WESTERN GATEWAY REGIONAL RECREATION AND
PARK DISTRICT SPECIAL TAX ELECTION

Background:

In 1974, the Western Gateway Regional Recreation and
Park District was established, by approval of the affected
voters, as an independent public entity. The purpose of the
District is to operate and maintain recreation and park
facilities within the boundaries of the Western Gateway
Regional Recreation and Park District. In June 1986, the
voters within the District, by a two-thirds majority vote,
approved the adoption of a special property tax, in the
amount of $7.95 per parcel per year, for the express
purpose of operating and maintaining recreation and park
facilities within the District.

Measure J:

By this measure, the Western Gateway Regional Recreation
and Park District is seeking voter approval to increase the
existing special tax from $7.95 per parcel per year to $12.95
per parcel per year.

The increased special tax would provide funds for the
express purpose of operating and maintaining the recreation
and park facilities within the Western Gateway Regional
Recreation and Park District. The increased special tax
would be levied only on those parcels of taxable real
property within the boundaries of the District. If approved by
the voters, the increased special tax will be levied annually
upon all taxable real property in the amount of $12.95 per
parcel per year.

The special tax may be collected by the County of Nevada
as other taxes are normally collected, and the County would
be authorized to retain an administrative fee for such
collection.

Requirement for Adoption:

Pursuant to Government Code Sections 50075-50077, this
measure requires the approval by a two-thirds majority of
those voting on the measure before the proposed increase
to the existing special tax will become effective. Failure of
this measure to pass would result in the special tax
remaining at $7.95 per parcel per year.

A "yes" vote on this measure means that the voter is in favor
of increasing the existing special tax to $12.95 per parcel
per year. A "no" vote means that the voter is not in favor of
increasing the existing special tax. If approved, the
increased special tax will become effective on November 6.
1996.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE J

Measure J is proposed for voter approval because Measure
E, a like proposal, did not get the required 2/3 majority
approval last March.

The current annual parcel charge to support Western
Gateway Park is $7.94, approved by voters in 1986—ten
years ago.

During those ten years, costs for operation and
maintenance of the Park have increased to the point where
the $7.94 parcel charge plus use fees are insufficient to
cover expenses.

Western Gateway Park is an 80-acre prized asset which
provides facilities for: organized sports activities for Little
Leaguers through Seniors; receptions; parties; memorial
services; group meetings; arts and crafts; graduation
ceremonies; weddings; concerts; children’s theater; picnics;
walking/hiking; flea markets; annual Easter egg hunt; and
many other community activities either by groups or
individuals.

Unless we voters approve the proposed $5.00 increase in
the annual parcel charge by the required 2/3 majority,
operations and maintenance will have to be severely cut
back.

After the failure of Measure E last March, one Little Leaguer
wrote that he wanted to donate his allowance so that the
park would remain open!!

The amount of money—$5.00 a year per parcel—is such a
small request versus the advantages of having such a
beautiful park for the recreational enjoyment of our
community.

Please join the concerned voters of the Western Gateway
Park District who have organized in the support of this
Western Gateway Park measure, and VOTE YES ON
MEASURE J. LET’S GET THE JOB DONE THIS TIME!!
