SAMPLE BALLOT

Measure I
May 3, 2005

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF

Property owners in the Nashville Trail Community Service District are assessed a
yearly fee of $200. The only exclusion goes to landowners that have more than
one parcel of land - they do not pay for additional parcels that have no dwelling.
The total collected is $12,000 per year. The assessment has not changed since the
road district was established in 1991. The costs today far exceed our budget.

For example: In 2004 we used funds accumulated over several years to repair
blacktop on Nashville Trail and put an overlay on half of it. That work took all
accumulated funds plus an advance from the County that we will pay back in 2005.
Then we will begin accumulating funds for several more years to overlay the rest
of Nashville Trail that is blacktop.

But Nashville Trail is not the only road in the District. We must continue to
maintain all the gravel and blacktop roads. In spite of donated work by many
landowners, the shortfall has become critical.

Over the past two years the Board developed and approved a plan to change the
fee, mailed the plan to landowners and invited them to a meeting to express views.
The Board will distribute the plan again this year before the vote in May.

Landowners will be asked to vote on three measures: 1) raise the basic assessment
fee from $200 to $300 per year, 2) remove the exclusion for landowners who own
more than one parcel, and 3) charge a $700 road impact fee for District businesses
that significantly impact roads. The Board unanimously recommends a vote of
"yes" on all three measures and thanks the many District members who have given
their support to its efforts.
