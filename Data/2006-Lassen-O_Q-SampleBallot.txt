IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE “O”

BY COUNTY COUNSEL

WEST PATTON VILLAGE
COMMUNITY SERVICES DISTRICT

This measure would authorize the West Patton Village
Community Services District (“the District”) to levy a special
parcel tax on real property located within the District in the
amounts of $213 per parcel containing one or more residential
structures and $319 per parcel containing one or more
commercial structures beginning in fiscal year 2006-2007
for the purposes of providing fire suppression, prevention,
rescue and emergency medical services within the District
or outside the District under mutual aid agreements with
other fire suppression agencies. Vacant parcels will not be
subject to the tax. The taxes will be collected either (1) on
the Lassen County property tax bill in the same manner and
subject to the same penalty as county property taxes or (2)
by individual billing to the property owner in which case the
bill will be payable in 45 days or be subject to a ten percent
(10%) penalty, accrue interest at the rate of one percent (1 %)
per month, and become a lien against the property if not
timely paid. This measure would also increase the District’s
spending limit as established by Article XIII B of the California
Constitution by an amount equal to the revenue from the
special tax beginning in fiscal year 2006-2007. This measure
will pass if two-thirds of the votes cast vote “Yes.”

NO ARGUMENTS FILED FOR OR AGAINST MEASURE “O”
