You have a $340,000,000 tax refund coming. Don’t let the politicians grab it! Vote NO on
Proposition G!

This proposition is misleading. First it says your tax money will be “refunded to San Diego’s
citizens.” That's a cleverly worded lie. Look closely - your money would really go to the politicians
in city government.

In 1988 the politicians asked the voters for permission to raise your taxes. The voters refused to
pass Proposition A by the majority required by law. Did the politicians care? No! They simply went
ahead and collected the tax anyway.

Dick Rider took the politicians to court demanding that they obey the law. The California Supreme
court ruled that Dick Rider was right, that the tax was illegal.

Assuming the court now accepts Dick Rider's remedy, the sales tax will drop to 6-1/4% until county
taxpayers have saved $340,000,000 in lower taxes. Our depressed economy desperately needs
this financial shot in the arm!

This rebate averages $135.00 for each man, woman, and child in the county. Could this tax savings
help you through this recession?

When someone takes your money unlawfully, we call that stealing. When those who steal are
caught red-handed, we do not let them keep the money. They have to give it back.

But politicians think they're above the law. They want to keep and spend the money they unlawfully
took from you.

Politicians are supposed to be lawmakers, not lawbreakers! if we reward their illegal action, they'll
just rob us again next year.

The politicians say they have good intentions for your money. But this is not about good intentions.
This is about breaking the law. No one may break the law, not even politicians.

Vote NO on Proposition G. Tell the politicians they can't keep your unlawfully taken tax money.

and, for those purposes, shall the tax rate increase (not to exceed 9.575 cents per $100.00 assessed
valuation) authorized on November 5,1974, be used solely and exclusively for those purposes In
addition to those approved by the majority of electors at the election held pursuant to Section 15708
of the Education Code of 1959 on November 5,1974, the District reserving the right to lease less
than all of the proposed facilities if circumstances shall so require?

COUNTY COUNSEL IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

On November 5,1974, a majority of electors voting at an election held in the district approved
a tax rate increase of the District of not to exceed 9,575 cents for each One Hundred Dollars
($100.00) of assessed valuation to be used for the purchase of sites, the preparation of plans and
specifications and the lease of buildings to be constructed, all at certain specified sites.

A “yes” vote on this proposition is a vote to use the previously authorized tax rate increase for
additions to existing facilities, reconstruction of existing facilities, the purchase of sites (not
presently owned by the district), the preparation of plans and specifications and the lease of
buildings to be constructed for use by the District consisting of fully furnished, equipped and
landscaped facilities as described in the proposition. This use of the tax rate increase for these
purposes would be in addition to the use approved at the November 5,1974, election and at the
June 7,1988, election. A “yes” vote does not increase the tax rate.

A "no” vote is a vote not to use the previously authorized tax rate increase for these purposes.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION O

SCHOOLS FOR SAN DIEGO’S CHILDREN

VOTE YES ON PROPOSITION 0

The School Improvement and Modernization Measure

-	In many neighborhoods, children are attending classes in overcrowded, deteriorating school
buildings.

-	Portable classrooms, year-round school schedules and double-session kindergartens have not
eliminated over-crowded classrooms.

-	Students do not have access to modern technology.

-	Lottery money by law cannot be used for school construction.

PROPOSITION O would provide funding to:

-	Remodel and modernize 27 schools, including all middle schools and junior highs.

-	Build 3 new elementary schools and 1 middle school.

-	Build 6 additions to existing schools.

-	Give our children access to modern technology that will prepare them for the workforce of the
21st century.

PROPOSITION O would cost each homeowner approximately $38.70 a year (on an assessed
valuation of $100,000.) for just 11 years.

That’s about 10 cents a day.

PROPOSITION O is the only bond measure that will provide construction money for San Diego City
Schools.

Our children are our future.

Vote for our children. They can't vote for themselves.

VOTE YES ON PROPOSITION O!

How much will this tax increase cost you? Don't take our word for it - or theirs!

Their estimate claims to be based on a $100,000 house. Most houses in San Diego cost much
more!

Multiply the value of your residence by the tax rate increase they want. If you rent, remember
landlords will increase rents to pay for this tax. Will you be paying $38.70 a year? Or a whole lot
more?

Regardless of the exact amount, is any tax increase justified? Have they wisely spent the money
they're getting already? Is this the last time they will ask you to pay more? Of course not.

California voters have recently been asked to approve the following tax and spending increases
for education:

Proposition	Year	Spendinq Requested
53	1986	$800,000,000
56	1986	$400,000,000
75	1988	$800,000,000
78	1988	$600,000,000
79	1988	$800,000,000
98	1988	$215,000,000
121	1990	$450,000,000
123	1990	$800,000,000

Add it up and see for yourself if the politicians will really be content with "about ten cents a day"
... or are they trying to “nickel and dime us to death"?

This tax increase is unnecessary. The future of education is parental choice. Under the voucher
system, parents can choose the superior education available at private schools.

Parental choice will make public schools less crowded. Why should we build new schools that
won't be needed?

Don't reward the wasteful politicians by giving them more moneyl Vote NO on Proposition O.

ARGUMENT AGAINST PROPOSITION O

The government spends about $5000 per student per year on public schools. For $5000 per year
you can send your child to a top-notch private elementary schooll The politicians are asking you
to pay for premium quality education, but that's not what they're delivering!

Now they say $5000 per year still isn’t enough. Now they want another $200 per year from the
average homeowner. Renters will pay too.

This tax increase is unnecessary. If they can't do the job for $5000 per student per year, there’s
something desperately wrong. How long will they keep coming to us for more tax money?

You and I have to live on a budget. If we can’t afford everything we want, we have to figure out a
way to do more with less. Why should politicians just keep taxing and spending? They should
figure out an alternative.

There are alternatives. Government schools have five times as many non-teaching personnel as
private schools. They should reduce this overhead before raising taxes any higher. But the
politicians won't do it.

What wil] the politicians do? They’ll just keep raising your taxes, over and over again, higher and
higher, until you say you've had enough!

Property taxes go up. Sales taxes go up. Income tax goes up. Then property taxes go up again!
They just keep piling it on! It’s time to call a foul on the politicians for piling on!

They'don’t need any more of your money. They’re already getting as much as better private
schools get.

Vote NO on vet another tax increase. Vote NO on Proposition O.

REBUTTAL TO THE ARGUMENT AGAINST PROPOSITION O

VOTE YES ON PROPOSITION O!

The School Improvement and Modernization Measure

Proposition O will cost each San Diego homeowner an average of $38.70 a year (on an assessed
valuation of $100,000.) for just 11 years, or about 10 cents a day.

That’s a small investment in our children's future.

Proposition O will provide money to modernize outdated schools and build new facilities in
communities where they are desperately needed.

Our children will have access to modern technology and a safe, healthy environment.

And schools in every community in San Diego will benefit.

Proposition O Is the only school bond measure on the ballot that will provide money for San
Diego City Schools.

A Yes vote on Proposition O will also provide almost 4,600 new jobs and will add $457 million to
San Diego's economy.

Our children are our future.

Vote for our children. They can’t vote for themselves.

Vote Yes on Proposition O!

POLL WORKERS AND FACILITIES NEEDED
MEET YOUR NEIGHBORS!

SERVE YOUR COMMUNITY!

There is a shortage of poll workers in many San Diego County
neighborhoods. Voters who are interested in this important work are
encouraged to apply by completing the application form. If you
apply immediately, it is possible that you could be assigned to work
at a polling place in the next election.

The Registrar is trying to build a permanent corps of poll workers;
therefore, homemakers and retired people, as well as others who
are interested in community service are particularly urged to apply.
The department also pays for the use of facilities to be used as a
polling place; i.e., home, clubhouse, business. Since the county
continues to grow and population centers shift, new polling places
are constantly needed.

You will receive a fee for your services.

Once this application is received you will be contacted by the
Registrar of Voters Office.
