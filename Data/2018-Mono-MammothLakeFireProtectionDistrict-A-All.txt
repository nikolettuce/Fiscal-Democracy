IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL
MEASURE A
MAMMOTH LAKES FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT

California Government Code section 53978 authorizes any local agency
providing fire protection services to propose, by ordinance, a special tax for
fire protection services provided by the local agency. Pursuant to this authority,
the governing body of the Mammoth Lakes fire Protection District proposes,
through “Measure A,” to impose a special tax on real property located within
the Mammoth Lakes Fire Protection District. The tax will take effect only if it is
approved by two-thirds of the District voters voting on the matter.

Measure A would impose a flat parcel tax of $79.00 on all taxable parcels
located within the Mammoth Lakes Fire Protection District.

The special tax would be levied once during the 2018-19 fiscal year at flat
rates based on the use of each taxable parcel of real-property, and then levied
once during each fiscal year thereafter with percentage adjustments (either
increasing or decreasing the amount of the tax) based on the percentage
change (if any) during the preceding 12-month period in the Consumer Price
Index of the Bureau ot Labor Statistics, United States Department of Labor.

A “Yes” vote on Measure A approves the proposed special tax on all taxable
parcels within the Mammoth Lakes Fire Protection District for fire protection
services.

A “No” vote on Measure A disapproves the proposed special tax on all taxable
parcels within the Mammoth Lakes Fire Protection District for fire protection
services.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure A.

“Argument in Favor of Measure A”

“A yes vote on Measure A will generate funds that shall be used for the
recruitment, retention, and training of our part-time firefighters and limited
full-time staff, and the expansion of services to create a more fire-resistant
community. The funds will support a sustainable and appropriate level of
emergency response to fires, rescues, medical emergencies, hazardous
materials, and other kinds of emergencies your Fire District is asked to respond
to. The wildfire threat is accelerating through the recent death of many trees
in and around the Fire District. The funds will support efforts to prevent, and
reduce the damages of, wildfires and structure fires in your Fire District. The
funds will also support completion of the significant training requirements
placed on firefighters (full-time and part-time). The best chance the Fire District
has to improve the outcome of an emergency is when it can respond quickly
and with enough people that have the right equipment and are well trained in
using the equipment. The funds provided through a yes vote on Measure A will
support the Fire District’s ability to improve outcomes.”
