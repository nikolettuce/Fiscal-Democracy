RESOLUTION OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OF THE COUNTY OF
SONOMA, STATE OF CALIFORNIA, ON BEHALF OF THE COAST
LIFE SUPPORT DISTRICT, PROPOSING AN ORDINANCE IMPOSING
A SPECIAL TAX FOR AMBULANCE, LIFE SUPPORT AND TRANSPORT
PURPOSES SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY TWO-THIRDS OF THE
VOTERS IN THE DISTRICT

WHEREAS, the Board of Supervisors of Sonoma County, on
behalf of the Coast Life Support District, proposes an ordinance
authorizing a special tax to be voted upon by the voters of the
District for ambulance, life support and transport purposes;

NOW, THEREFORE, the Board of Supervisors, on behalf of the
District, hereby resolves that an ordinance authorizing such a
special tax be presented to the voters of the District, which
ordinance shall be worded as follows:

Section I. PURPOSE AND INTENT

It is the purpose of this Ordinance to authorize the levy of
a special tax on parcels of real property that are within the
Coast Life Support District, established by Chapter 375, Statutes
of 1986, in order to augment funding for furnishing, operating
and maintaining emergency medical services, ambulance, life
support, and transport equipment and services.

This is a special tax within the meaning of Section 4 of
Article XIII A of the California Constitution, and is being
enacted pursuant to the authority and procedures of Chapter 375,
Statutes of 1986 and Government Code Section 50077. This tax is
a property tax, but the amount of tax is not determined according
to nor is it in any manner based upon the value of the property.
It is based, to the extent practical, upon the costs of providing
ambulance and life support and transportation services associated
with each parcel, its use and the improvements thereon. Since
this tax is not an ad valorem tax, the exemptions contained in or
authorized by Article XIII of the California Constitution shall
not apply.

The taxes imposed by this Ordinance may be collected by the
Counties on behalf of the District in the same manner and subject
to the same penalty as other charges and taxes fixed and
collected by the Counties.

1

The revenues raised by this tax are to be used solely for
the purposes of obtaining, furnishing, operating and maintaining
emergency medical services, ambulance, life support and transport
equipment or apparatus and services, and for other necessary
operating expenses of the District, consistent with Section 40 of
Chapter 375, Statutes of 1986. (Coast Life Support District
Act) .

SECTION II. SPECIAL TAX

The District's Board of Directors is authorized to levy a
special tax within the boundaries of the Coast Life Support
District each year, for the purposes stated in Section I, on each
parcel of land shown on the respective County Assessor's parcel
maps and carried on the County secured property tax rolls;
provided, however, that such a special tax shall not be imposed
upon a federal or state governmental agency or another local
agency. This special tax shall be imposed in accordance with the
following schedule.

The following are the special tax rates for the Coast Life

Support District:

Actual Land Use	Unit	Value

Undeveloped Land	1

Single family dwelling	3

Farm, agricultural, rural	4

Duplex	6

Other Multi-family Dwellings including

trailer parks	8

churches, hospitaIs and rest	homes	8

Service stations, stores, enterprises,

commercial, industrial, office	buildings	10

HoteIs, mote Is, restaurants, golf courses,
theatres	20

SECTION III. SPECIAL TAX LIMIT

The special tax authorized by this Ordinance shall not
exceed $12.00 per unit of benefit per year.

2

SECTION IV. REPORT AND HEARING

Each year prior to the imposition of said tax the District's
Board of Directors shall cause a report to be prepared showing
each parcel, the owner (s) thereof, and the proposed levy thereon.
Upon the receipt of such report, the Board of Directors shall set
a date for a hearing thereof and shall cause notice of such
hearing to be posted at three (3) public places within the
District, or, in lieu of posting, by mailing notice of hearing to
each property owner at the address disclosed on the latest tax
roll. At said hearing, the Board of Directors shall make such
corrections to the taxes proposed to be levied as may be required
to conform to the schedule as set forth above.

SECTION V. COLLECTION

The tax shall be collected in the same manner and subject to the
same penalty as other property taxes collected by the Counties.

SECTION VI. SEVERABILITY CLAUSE

If any section, subsection, sentence, phrase or clause of
this Ordinance is for any reason held to be invalid, such
decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions
of this Ordinance. The Directors of the District hereby declare
that they would have adopted the Ordinance and each section
thereof despite the fact that any one or more section^,
subsections, phrases or clauses be declared invalid.

SECTION VII. EFFECTIVE DATE

This Ordinance shall take effect immediately upon its
confirmation by two-thirds of the voters in the District voting
in an election to be held on November 4, 1986.

SECTION VIII. LANGUAGE OF PROPOSITION

The proposition to appear on the ballot shall be as follows:

Ord. #3600R

"Shall the Coast Life Support District adopt an ordinance
authorizing imposition of a special tax not to exceed $12.00
per unit of benefit per year for emergency medical services,
ambulance, life support and transport equipment and
services, and for necessary operating expenses of the
District, which charges shall be established by the Board of
Directors of the District according to the units of benefit
for the different categories of land use as set forth in the
ord inance?"

Recommended appointees, COAST LIFE SUPPORT DISTRICT

AB 4227 Sec. 21 states "The first board of directors shall be appointed,
upon the formation of the district, by the boards of supervisors of the
counties. Mendocino County shall appoint four members, Sonorna County shall
appoint three members." We designed the legislation this way mainly to
simplify voter choices in November ’86, but also to show that the counties
are "joint bodies of interest" from the outset.

It is desirable that your appointments be ready for announcement soon after
AB 4227 is signed by the Governor. We have reasonable prospects that this
can occur as early as July 8. Up to this point the planning for the dis-
trict, including for the critical hurdle of passing the benefit assessment
by 2/3 vote, has been done by our ad hoc group. The real board should take
over this responsibility at the earliest. Hence the need for your action.

The following are our recommendations for appointees. We have selected
people familiar with emergency services, usually because they have served
with a volunteer fire department. They are also community-minded and have
the standing that will build voter in the new district.

Dan Levin, residence The Sea Ranch, Dan, an architect, is Chief of the Sea
Ranch Volunteer Fire Dept. He has worked out mutual aid with neighboring
fire districts and is looked to as the regional leader.

Jane Huiskens, residence Annapolis. Jane, a housewife, is active in
community groups, including the Annapolis Volunteer Fire Dept,

Bill Platt, residence The Sea Ranch. I feel contributors will expect me to
follow through into initial operations. I plan, however, to ask for one of

the one year terms.

Tim Cooke, residence Gualala. Tim, a building contractor, is Chief of the
Gualala Volunteer Fire Dept, and has assisted in monitoring the existing
ambulance arrangement.

JoAnn Harris, residence Gualala. JoAnn, recently retired from operating a
successful small business in Gualala, played a key role in the fund-raising
that insured continuity of ambulance operations until the district can be
operational. She also helped get AB 4227 through the legislature,

Fred Morgan, residence Point Arena. Fred is Chief of the Point Arena
Volunteer Fire Dept. He also heads the Paint Arena Medical Clinic.

Dr. Reuben Balzer, residence Irish Beach. Dr. Balzer, a retired MD, will
also help our representation from the north of the district.

Let me know if you want
the above candidates.

Dear Ernie, re: COAST LIFE SUPPORT

Yesterday we got a unanimous vote in the Senate Local Government Committee
and, a recommendation of ’’consent” to the only remaining committee—Senate
Appropriations! So I really think it’s going to happen, particularly
because we also saw Bob Williams of the Governor’s Legislative Office, who
says arrangements are all in place for a Governor's approval.

This letter is partly to thank you for talking at length with Peter
Detwiler—it helped, but mainly to put you in the picture on next steps, on
some of which we need, your help.

We too are impressed with Peter, who finally turned out to be supportive.
Luke Breit of Hauser’s office had already stroked him ski 1Ifully. Peter and

Luke had agreed upon 27 amendments—most very minoi---and the Committee and

Dan Hauser, with skillful chairing by Senator Marian Bergeson, adopted them
as Committee amendments, thus saving time and obviating the need for a
clean-up bill. The hearing was no pushover, however:	Senators Marks and

Russell asked a lot of questions of Dan, me and Peter.

1.	I enclose a memo to you and Norman about appointments to the District
Board. We need your early action so as to maintain our momentum.

2.	We will need to get the elections departments of the counties geared up
for presenting the revenue issue and the appropriations limit on the
November ballot. We are preparing a draft of the arguments that will
accompany the sample ballot. Is there anything else we or you need to do on

this matter before the bill is passed and signed?

3.	We need to get closure on the design of the benefit assessment. I have
proposed such a design to Donna and to Ernie Dickens. I—got back general
acceptance from Ernie. I believe Donna needs concurrence by Marian Moe and
possibly the Assessor’s office. Ideally this item should be settled jointly

between the two counties, because we want equal treatment of parcel owners
on both sides of the county boundary. This is not easy with the non-
identical land-use classification schemes of the two counties. What I would

appreciate from you is your calling Donna to ask her to set up a meeting in
either Santa Rosa or Ukiah to finalize this matter, based on my preliminary
design. Present should be Ernie and Donna, legal people and assessors from
both counties. Your and Norman’s presence would be helpf-ul, but not
mandatory. I suggest we aim at sometime between July 9-31.

The above would benefit from your counsel. Meanwhile we are proceding with
planning on a number of things that will face the new district’s board.

BALLOT ARGUMENT:	SUPPORT	FOR	SPECIAL TAX MEASURE _f___

COAST LIFE SUPPORT DISTRICT

The nearest hospital emergency room is two hours away from most
of the population in this district. The continued availability
of ambulance service with trained emergency personnel is crucial
for the life of our community. The approval of this special tax
will enable the newly formed Coast Life Support District to
continue to provide such service.

The need for comnranity-wide support for ambulance service became
apparent when the existing private ambulance company faced
bankruptcy. Patient fees and modest subventions from Mendocino
and Sonoma Counties cannot provide sufficient funding. Current
demand for ambulance service averages around three runs per week,
whereas to break-even from patient fees alone, it is generally
recognized that an ambulance company needs four runs per day■

To assure continuity of ambulance service while a permanent
solution was developed, . the community organized a massive fund-
raising effort, At the same time the community asked the State
legislature to establish a permanent cross-county district under
local control, This was done with the passage and signing of
AB 4227. That bill authorizes the two Counties to give District
voters the opportunity to approve revenue measures necessary'to
fund the District.

The assessment authorized by this measure, togetheriwith existing
user fees and county subventions, will provide *^®?®revenue1

^	.	Z	"r"	’V	i	cr	a.	1	:	Le

,._/r	. , V ■ This measure authorizes a benefit assessment; upon

properties within the district, The assessment will vary
according to uSe of the land. Hence a parcel with a single
family dwelling^ fdr example, will be assessed less than a
commercial parcel with a multiple-unit hotel. The vote on this
revenue measure must pass by a two-thirds majority if the
district is to become operational,

Approval of this Measure and the accompanying measure on an

appropriation limit (Measure _____), will guarantee ambulance and

emergency services you can depend on.

COUNTY COUNSEL’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE
AUTHORIZING A SPECIAL TAX FOR THE COAST LIFE SUPPORT DISTRICT

The State Legislature has created a new taxing district
in the coastal area of northern Sonoma County and southern
Mendocino County called the Coast Life Support District. The
purpose of the District is to provide ambulance and related
emergency medical service programs.

A YES vote on Measure f_ by two-thirds of the voters of
the district voting on this measure would allow the Coast Life
Support District's Board of Directors to impose a special tax for
furnishing, operating and maintaining emergency medical,
ambulance, life support and transport equipment and services.

The rate of this tax would be set by the Board of
Directors of the Coast Life Support District at a rate not to
exceed $12.00 per unit of benefit. A unit of benefit is a
measure of the estimated benefit to each parcel based on the
actual land use. Before imposing this tax, the District's Board
of Directors would consider a report on the proposed tax for each
parcel. In addition, the District's Board of Directors would
hold a public hearing on the proposed tax, at which time
individuals could protest the amount of the tax on their parcel.

The tax would apply to any person who owns real
property within the boundaries of the district. The special tax

analy.mm

would be collected in the same manner as property taxes.
