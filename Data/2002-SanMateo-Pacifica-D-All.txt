ORDINANCE NO. C-02

AN ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF PACIFICA
VALIDATING AND RE-ENACTING CERTAIN AMENDMENTS TO
THE CITY’S UTILITY USERS TAX

THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY OF PACIFICA DO ORDAIN AS FOLLOWS:

Section 1. Validation of Existing Ordinance. Ordinance Nos. 570-C.S.
and 601-C.S. of the City of Pacifica, which increased the ceiling on utility
users tax paid by businesses in the City from $175 to $500 per year, are
hereby validated and re-approved or approved to the fullest extent
permitted by law.

Section 2. Readoption of Existing Ordinance. Ordinance Nos. 570-C.S.
and 601-C.S. of the City of Pacifica are hereby re-enacted.

Section 3. Amendment or Repeal. Section 3-11.08 of the Pacifica
Municipal Code amended by Sections 1 and 2 of this Ordinance may be
repealed or amended by the City Council without a vote of the people
except as follows: as required by Propositions 62 and 218, any amendment
to Section 3-11.08 that increases the amount of tax beyond the levels
authorized by this Ordinance may not take effect unless approved by a vote
of the people.

Section 4. Findings. The people of the City of Pacifica find as follows:

(a)	On June 10, 1991, the City Council adopted Ordinance
No. 570-C.S. to increase the ceiling on utility users taxes payable by
businesses from $175 to $500 per year. On February 22, 1993 the City
Council adopted Ordinance No. 601-C.S. to reaffirm that increase. In the
early 1990’s the Legislature balanced the State budget by taking property
taxes away from cities. From 1991 through 1997, the State took $3,035,400
in property taxes from Pacifica. The portion of the utility users tax paid by
businesses by virtue of the increase in the annual tax ceiling contributes to
the City’s General Fund and is used to pay for general City services,
primarily police and fire services.

(b)	In 1986 the State’s voters approved Proposition 62 to
require voter approval of local general taxes. The City Council did not seek
voter approval of Ordinance Nos. 570-C.S. and 601-C.S. because a number
of appeals courts, including the court which ruled in the case of City of
Woodlake v. Logan, 230 Cal.App.3d 1058 (1991), had previously decided
that Proposition 62’s requirement that general taxes be submitted to a
referendum violated the California Constitution and was therefore
unenforceable. On December 14, 1995, the California Supreme Court
disapproved the Woodlake decision in the case of Santa Clara County
Local Transportation Authority v. Guardino, 11 Cal.4th 220 (1995). On
June 4, 2001, that Court decided Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association
v. City of La Habra, 26 Cal.4th 236 (2001), which further suggested that the
City should seek voter approval of Ordinance Nos. 570-C.S. and
601-C.S. The City Council thereafter proposed this Ordinance to the
voters to validate the ordinances.

(c)	Following terrorist attacks against the United States on
September 11, 2001, all governmental units, including the City, have
incurred increased demands for police, fire and other emergency services.
The utility users tax on business provides a substantial portion of the City’s
General Fund and is used to pay for general City services, primarily police
and fire services. In addition, the slowing state and national economy,

together with the effects of the energy crisis, have placed the state in a
fiscal deficit, a deficit that will likely lead to further reductions in state
funding for City services. Maintaining the current level of the utility users
tax payable by businesses is required to assist the City in maintaining
general governmental services to the community in light of these fiscal
threats.

(d)	This Ordinance was proposed by the City Council of the
City of Pacifica by the adoption of Resolution No. 31-02 by the affirmative
votes of not less than four of its five members as required by Government
Code Section 53724(b).

Section 5. Intent. Section 1 of this Ordinance is intended to
authorize the continued collection of the utility users tax, to validate the
amendment of that tax, and to validate taxes previously collected pursuant
to Ordinance Nos. 570-C.S. and 601-C.S. Section 2 of this Ordinance is
intended to re-enact Ordinance Nos. 570-C.S. and 601-C.S. to
authorize future collection of the tax on businesses up to an annual ceiling
of $500 in the event it is determined that Section 1 is not sufficient to do so.

Section 6. Effective Date. This ordinance shall take effect ten
days after the result of election is declared by the City Council of the
City of Pacifica.

Section 7. Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence,
clause, phrase, or portion of this Ordinance or Ordinance Nos. 570-C.S.
and 601-C.S. validated or reenacted by it, is for any reason held to be
invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
remaining portions of this Ordinance and Ordinance Nos. 570-C.S. and
601-C.S. shall nonetheless remain in full force and effect. The
City Council hereby declares that it would have adopted each section,
subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this Ordinance and
Ordinance Nos. 570-C.S. and 601-C.S., irrespective of the fact that any one
or more sections, subsections, sentences, clauses, phrases, or portions of
this Ordinance and Ordinance Nos. 570-C.S. and 601-C.S. be declared
invalid or unenforceable.

Section 8. Execution. The Mayor is hereby authorized to attest
to the adoption of this Ordinance by the voters of the City by signing where
indicated below.

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE D

Background. In 1986 the State’s voters approved Proposition 62 to
require voter approval of local general taxes. California courts found
Proposition 62 unconstitutional and the City therefore did not seek voter
approval of a 1991 amendment to its utility users tax ordinance to increase
the maximum tax for business taxpayers from $175 per year to $500. The
California Supreme Court recently overturned those earlier decisions and
upheld Proposition 62. Accordingly, the City Council now proposes this
measure to allow the voters to validate the 1991 amendment. The
ordinance states that doing so will allow the City to maintain current tax
revenues and assist the City in funding general governmental services in
light of increased demands for City services following the terrorist
incidents of September 11, 2001 and further reductions in state funding for
City services expected to result from the state’s current budget deficit.

In the early 1990’s the Legislature balanced the State budget by
taking property taxes away from cities and counties. From 1991 through
2001, the State took $5,980,656 in property taxes from Pacifica. To
partially replace this revenue, the City increased the annual ceiling on
utility taxes paid by businesses in the City. No change was made to the
utility tax paid by City residents. The increased ceiling on business utility
taxes contributes approximately $165,000 per year to the City’s General
Fund, which pays for general City services, primarily police and fire
services.

The Measure. The measure would validate and readopt the 1991
ordinance mentioned above, as well as a 1993 ordinance which reaffirmed
that earlier action, and validate taxes previously collected under that
ordinance. The measure could protect the City from refund claims from
businesses based on arguments that the recent court decisions upholding
Proposition 62 should retroactively invalidate taxes imposed before that
court decision was made. The ordinance authorizes the City Council to
repeal or reduce the utility users tax or to amend the ordinance in other
ways that do not increase tax rates. However, any tax increase would
require voter approval.
