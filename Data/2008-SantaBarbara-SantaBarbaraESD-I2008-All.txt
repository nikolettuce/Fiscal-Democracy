ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE 12008
SANTA BARBARA ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT

The Santa Barbara Elementary School District has provided
high-quality educational programs since 1866. Due to
substantial state budget cuts, local schools need supplemental
local tax dollars to fund programs that provide our students with
the highest quality education. Measure 12006 will provide a
stable, consistent, locally controlled funding source.

Measure 12008 will allow the Santa Barbara Elementary School
District to:

•	Supplement math and science education;

•	Hire fulltime classroom music teachers, purchase musical
instruments, and repair instruments for the music program;

•	Enhance computer and educational technology.

Measure 12008 will improve the Santa Barbara Elementary
School District by:

•	Maintaining critical school programs, such as music and
performing arts programs, which bring together students
with diverse backgrounds and offer positive opportunities
for at-risk youth.

•	Enhancing rigorous standards-based instruction and best
teaching practices for student achievement

•	Providing support to alt elementary schools, including
charter schools, proportional to the enrollment of students
from the Santa Barbara Elementary School District.

Measure 12006 protects taxpayers by:

•	Requiring that all funds be used locally to improve the
Santa Barbara Elementary School District.

•	Creating an independent citizen oversight committee.

•	Requiring annual reporting on expenditures and annual
independent financial audit.

•	Requiring compliance with accountability measures as
determined by law.

•	Expires In four years unless reauthorized by voters.

•	Senior citizens may request exemption from the measure.

Measure 12006 is a smart investment in quality public education
and in our community; there is a strong correlation between
quality schools and property values.

Please join us in investing in the future of our children.

The undersigned proponent(s) of the primary argument in favor
of ballot Measure 12008 at the Presidential General Election to
be held on November 4,2008, hereby state(s) that such
argument is true and correct to the best of his/her/their
knowledge and belief.
