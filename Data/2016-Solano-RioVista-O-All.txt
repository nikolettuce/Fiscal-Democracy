Measure O - Rio Vista General City Services Tax Measure
Impartial Analysis by City Attorney, City of Rio Vista

The City Council of the City of Rio Vista has placed Measure O on the November 8, 2016 ballot.
California Revenue and Taxation Code section 7285.9 authorizes the City Council to levy a
transactions and use tax via ordinance, provided the ordinance establishing the tax is ultimately
approved by the voters.

If approved by Rio Vista voters, Measure O will extend the three-quarters (0.75%) transactions and
use tax which was previously approved by the voters in 2012, for an additional period of five years.

A transactions and use tax is administered by the State Board of Equalization and is commonly
referred to as a sales tax. Once established, this tax is allocated to the city where any goods are
delivered or placed into use. The transactions and use tax that would be established by Measure O is
also considered to be a “general tax.”

As a “general tax,” the revenue generated by Measure O will be deposited in the City’s general fund.
Further, the ballot question for Measure O states that the 0.75 percent transactions and use tax is to
be used for funding City services “including police, fire, parks and other city services.” Because this
transactions and use tax would be a “general tax,” the City of Rio Vista would be able to use tax
proceeds for any legal governmental purpose without restriction. The City of Rio Vista would not be
legally bound in any way to use the tax monies for any special purpose or for any particular program
or service.

The tax derived from Measure O would be paid in addition to current sales taxes and would be
collected at the same time and in the same manner as existing sales taxes. All revenues raised by the
tax would belong to the City and would not be shared with the State or any other agency.

Also, because Measure O is a “general tax,” it will be approved if a simple majority (50% + 1) of
voters vote in favor of it. If approved, Measure O would become effective in 2017 and remain in
effect until 2022. The tax would expire at the end of the five-year period unless it is reauthorized by
a majority of the voters at a future election that occurs prior to the expiration of the tax.

A “YES” vote is a vote to approve the ordinance extending the 0.75 percent transactions and use tax
for a period of five years. A “NO” vote is a vote against the extension of the tax.

Rio Vista City Attorney

Argument in Favor of Measure O - November 8, 2016 Ballot

On November 6, 2012, Rio Vista voters approved Measure O, a %-cent sales tax, with
69.05% voter support. The revenues from Measure O were used to support continued
operations of Rio Vista general services; collection began on April 1, 2013, and (unless
renewed by Rio Vista voters) will expire March 31, 2018.

Leading the list of services presently being provided through Measure O are paramedic
services to Rio Vista residents, along with such other critical services as police, fire, land-
use planning, and-the-like. Especially given the fact that there is no hospital, medical
center, nor even a medical doctor in the city, keeping adequate paramedic services in place
is vital for all Rio Vista residents, especially local seniors and youth. Since this is a renewal,
keeping this sales tax in place will NOT increase local taxes, and all funds will remain within
the city.

The City of Rio Vista continues to suffer the effects of the Great Recession; yet, the city’s
population continues to grow. Public Safety costs have increased from 52% to 58% of
the General Fund budget since 2007; yet, General Fund revenues (excluding Measure
O) have decreased 37%. Thanks in part to Measure O funding, the City has been able
to add five Public Safety positions; however, in order to maintain police, fire, and
paramedic services at the current levels, the existing %-cent sales tax must remain in
place. If this tax is not renewed, Rio Vista will have an approximate $215,000 deficit for
Fiscal Year 2017-18, increasing to an approximate $800,000 deficit in FY 2018-19. As a
result, critical Police, Fire, and paramedic services may have to be cut. Additional cuts
can include street maintenance and closure of the City’s youth center and swimming pool.

City Council urges voters to renew the 3/4-cent sales tax for five years.

and provides a measure therefore that can be administered and collected by the State

Measure O - Rio Vista General City Services Tax Measure
Impartial Analysis by City Attorney, City of Rio Vista

The City Council of the City of Rio Vista has placed Measure O on the November 8, 2016 ballot.
California Revenue and Taxation Code section 7285.9 authorizes the City Council to levy a
transactions and use tax via ordinance, provided the ordinance establishing the tax is ultimately
approved by the voters.

If approved by Rio Vista voters, Measure O will extend the three-quarters (0.75%) transactions and
use tax which was previously approved by the voters in 2012, for an additional period of five years.

A transactions and use tax is administered by the State Board of Equalization and is commonly
referred to as a sales tax. Once established, this tax is allocated to the city where any goods are
delivered or placed into use. The transactions and use tax that would be established by Measure O is
also considered to be a “general tax.”

As a “general tax,” the revenue generated by Measure O will be deposited in the City’s general fund.
Further, the ballot question for Measure O states that the 0.75 percent transactions and use tax is to
be used for funding City services “including police, fire, parks and other city services.” Because this
transactions and use tax would be a “general tax,” the City of Rio Vista would be able to use tax
proceeds for any legal governmental puipose without restriction. The City of Rio Vista would not be
legally bound in any way to use the tax monies for any special purpose or for any particular program
or service.

The tax derived from Measure O would be paid in addition to current sales taxes and would be
collected at the same time and in the same manner as existing sales taxes. All revenues raised by the
tax would belong to the City and would not be shared with the State or any other agency.

Also, because Measure O is a “general tax,” it will be approved if a simple majority (50% + 1) of
voters vote in favor of it. If approved, Measure O would become effective in 2017 and remain in
effect until 2022. The tax would expire at the end of the five-year period unless it is reauthorized by
a majority of the voters at a future election that occurs prior to the expiration of the tax.

A “YES” vote is a vote to approve the ordinance extending the 0.75 percent transactions and use tax
for a period of five years. A “NO” vote is a vote against the extension of the tax.

Argument in Favor of Measure O - November 8, 2016 Ballot

On November 6, 2012, Rio Vista voters approved Measure O, a %-cent sales tax, with
69.05% voter support. The revenues from Measure O were used to support continued
operations of Rio Vista general services; collection began on April 1, 2013, and (unless
renewed by Rio Vista voters) will expire March 31, 2018.

Leading the list of services presently being provided through Measure O are paramedic
services to Rio Vista residents, along with such other critical services as police, fire, land-
use planning, and-the-like. Especially given the fact that there is no hospital, medical
center, nor even a medical doctor in the city, keeping adequate paramedic services in
place is vital for all Rio Vista residents, especially local seniors and youth. Since this is a
renewal, keeping this sales tax in place will NOT increase local taxes, and all funds will
remain within the city.

The City of Rio Vista continues to suffer the effects of the Great Recession; yet, the
city’s population continues to grow. Public Safety costs have increased from 52% to
58% of the General Fund budget since 2007; yet, General Fund revenues (excluding
Measure O) have decreased 37%. Thanks in part to Measure O funding, the City has
been able to add five Public Safety positions; however, in order to maintain police, fire,
and paramedic services at the current levels, the existing %-cent sales tax must remain
in place. If this tax is not renewed, Rio Vista will have an approximate $215,000 deficit
for Fiscal Year 2017-18, increasing to an approximate $800,000 deficit in FY 2018-19.
As a result, critical Police, Fire, and paramedic services may have to be cut. Additional
cuts can include street maintenance and closure of the City’s youth center and
swimming pool.

City Council urges voters to renew the %-cent sales tax for five years.

Taxation Code and Section 7285.9 of Part 1.7 of Division 2 which authorizes the City to
adopt this tax ordinance which shall be operative if a majority of the electors voting on
the measure vote to approve the imposition of the tax at an election called for that
purpose.

B.	To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that incorporates
provisions identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the State of California
insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and limitations
contained in Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.

C.	To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that imposes a tax
and provides a measure therefore that can be administered and collected by the State
Board of Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as practicable to, and
requires the least possible deviation from, the existing statutory and administrative
procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in administering and collecting
the California State Sales and Use Taxes.

D.	To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that can be
administered in a manner that will be, to the greatest degree possible, consistent with

cost of collecting the transactions and use taxes, and at the same time, minimize the
burden of record keeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this
ordinance.
