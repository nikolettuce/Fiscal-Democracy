FORESTVILLE FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT
MEASURE V

Shall Forestville Fire Protection District Ordinance No.

V 09/10-01 be approved, authorizing the District to impose
and levy a new special tax having a flat rate of $75 per
improved parcel of real property within the Fire Protection
District, to assist in meeting the costs of providing authorized
services and exercising other rights and powers of the District?

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE V

Forestville firefighters need you. Vote Yes on Measure V.

It has been 28 years since the Forestville Firefighters have asked for a tax in-
crease. The financial crisis during the past two years has taken its toll. The Fire
Chiefs pay has been cut 50%. There is nothing left to cut that will not impact their
ability to serve the community.

The Fire District is surviving because of the dedication of both the paid and volun-
teer firefighters. Future budget cuts will reduce current staffing levels which will
cause longer response times and reduce the number of personnel on the District’s
engines. Measure V prevents that from happening. The best part is Measure V will
only cost property owners an additional 20.5 cents per day.

96% of you are satisfied with the performance of the Forestville Firefighters accord-
ing to a recent survey, and for good reason. Forestville Firefighters respond to
nearly 700 emergencies each year. Maintaining response times is crucial. Last
year, over 385 of those responses were medical related. That's over one medical
emergency each and every day,

In addition to structural fires and medical emergencies, the Forestville Firefighters
respond to vehicle accidents, vegetation fires, storm and flood related emergen-
cies as well as providing special assistance to the elderly.

The Forestville Fire Protection District's current parcel tax has not been increased
since it was passed by the voters in 1982. The tax only has 56% of its worth in to-
day's dollars.

Measure V will allow the Forestville Firefighters to purchase essential safety equip-
ment. It will make needed repairs to their 35 year-old fire station and replace aging
apparatus.

Measure V ensures quick response times and adequate staffing when you need
them. Remember, Measure V will only cost property owners an additional 20.5
cents per day,

Protect Forestville and vote Yes on Measure V.
