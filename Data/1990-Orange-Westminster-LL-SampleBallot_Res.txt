This Ordinance if adopted would increase the business license tax rate
: assessed certain specified typesof businesses doing business within the City
; of Westminster. The types of businesses and.the specific amount,to.be
I assessed such' businesses are specifically set forth within the Ordinance.

. In addition, the Ordinance provides that the business license tax rate
\ assessed against businesses doing business within the City of Westminster
| shall,..commencing January 1, 1992, be adjusted annually to reflect any
I increase or decrease in the consumer price index.'

' The Ordinance also creates a hew classification and rate for businesses
i which lease or rent commercial and/or industrial buildings to third parties.
The Ordinance provides a definition of,full and part-time employees.

The fiscal impact of this'Ordinarice is to increase revenues.for the general
fund'of the City of Westminster The proposed increase is projected by the
Finance Director for the City of Westminster to generate an increase in general
■' revenue funds in an approximate amount in excess of "THREE HUNDRED
; THOUSAND DOLLARS ($300,000.00) annually.

ARGullWT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE LL :

THE BUSINESS'LICENSE TAX RATE’HAS NOT BEEN INCREASED SINCE
1978.	' " '	:	’

*	As a homeowner and taxpayer, you pay your fair share for city services. .
This increase will insure that businesses also pay their fair share.

*	Currently large business pay the same rate as small.“mom and pop”'
type businesses. This increase will bring this inequity^more into balance.

■ * The current business license fee is substantially lower than the current
business license fee in our neighboring cities. ■

The business license tax helps.support many of the public services that make
Westminster a desirable place to live, shop, work and locate a- business.
Those services include police, fire and paramedics; an anti-graffiti program;
maintenance of public grounds, parks and street sweeping; general commu-
nity services; and code enforcement activities designed to insure that busi-1
nesses are good neighbors to Westminster’s over 70,000 residents. 1

The business license program provides local businesses with emergency
services. It also provides the city with.a central source of data about the type,;
ownership, and locations of businesses throughout the community. . ...

The business license tax will be a revenue measure based mainly uponNa flat,
rate plus the number of employees. These rates must be increased in order to'
restore-the buying power to approximately what it was in 1978, .when the
rates were last increased.	.

Recognizing the need for the business community to pay a fair share of the!
increased cost of government services, the Westminster Chamber of Com-"
merce took official action to support and work for passage of this increase.
VOTE FOR FAIRNESS!

VOTE YES!

ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE LL .

' 1

This tax should not be passed!!

It will be paid by the already overtaxed citizens of Westminster; because if
enacted; the businesses in our city will have to raise the cost of thegoods that
they sell, and the consumer, you and I, will pay the bill.	-	,	>

An alternative to raising taxes is to cut spending, but the controlled Majority\
on our council apparently does not have the intestinal fortitude to say no to)
increased spending. Therefore, they want to add yet another tax on their;
constituents, in addition to the 5% Utility tax and user fees on everything!
. except the grass in our parks. Maybe that will be next if we taxpayers don’t;
put a stop to an additional tax burden by voting “NO” on this ordinance. \

Do yourselves a service, and let the weak politicians know that enough is*
enough. Force them to be more prudent with your tax money and spend only
what you, the taxpayer, allow. Let them know that they must live within thej
limits you set.

This is not the time to,.tax and spend more arid more. Jobs are being
eliminated in many of our businesses and this affects what people have to'
spend on goods and services. Additional taxes only cause a deeper recession)
and create a hardship on the families in Westminster. VOTE NO.ON MORE
TAXES!

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL^ ^  MEASURE M  Measure M is being submitted to the voters of Orange County according to the requirements of the Local Transportation Authority and Improvement Act enacted by the Legislature in 1987. Measure M is a proposal to'supplement existing local revenues for public transportation purposes. The revenues proposed to be raised by this measure will be allocated by the Orange County Local Transportation Authority for the construction and improvement of State highways, the construction, maintenance, improvement and operation of local streets, roads and highways, and the construction, improvement and operation of public transit systems (including bus, light rail, rapid transit and commuter rail services and facilities), all within the County of Orange, described in the Revised Traffic Improvement and Growth Management Plan.. .  Currently Orange County residents are paying a 6 1/4% retail transactions and use tax for purchases subject to such tax throughout Orange County. Those taxes are allocated in the amount of 51/4% to the State of California and 1% to the County of Orange and the cities within Orange County. (The amount of 1/4% to the State of California is authorized from December 31,1989, to December 31,1990, for earthquake relief.)  Measure M would provide that there would be, for a period of 20 years, a 1/2 of 1% retail transactions and use tax above the existing 6 1/4% tax. Measure M would provide that the proceeds of such 1/2 of 1% tax would be placed in a trust fund to be used solely for the transportation projects and programs detailed in the Revised Traffic Improvement and Growth Management Plan. The Plan was adopted by the Local Transportation Authority after receiving approval by the' Orange County Board of Supervisors and the city councils of a majority of the cities in the County as required by law. Measure M would authorize the Local Transportation Authority to issue bonds payable solely from the proceeds of the tax, with the proceeds of such bonds being used to finance capital outlay expenditures for those transportation projects. •  This measure required an affirmative vote of a majority of the electors voting on the measure.  The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure M. If you desire a copy of the measure, please call the Registrar of Voters office at (714) 567-7600 and a copy will be mailed at no cost to you.	
ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE M  VOTE YES ON REVISED MEASURE M...WE HEARD YOU.  We heard you. The new, Revised Measure M, Orange County Traffic and Growth Management Program, incorporates not only a balanced traffic im- provement plan but includes increased safeguards and legal guarantees to insure that when you vote for Revised Measure M, you will receive its benefits.  Any change in the overall expenditure plan regarding the types of projects NOW legally requires a new vote of the people..  The funds are safeguarded in a legally designated trust fund for use only.on the specific programs required by Revised Measure M.  An independent auditor-controller must annually certify that the Revised Measure M funds have been used only for Revised Measure M projects.  ; Revised Measure M guarantees;-  -	a new commuter rail system;  -	up to three new lanes in each direction of the Santa Ana Freeway (1-5) from Los Angeles to San Clemente;  -	a new El Toro “Y" interchange at the junction of 1-5/1-405;  -	a new lane in each direction, and major interchange improvements on the Riverside Freeway (State Route 91);  -	a new lane in each direction on the Costa Mesa Freeway (State Route 55) between the Riverside and Santa Ana freeways;  -	synchronized traffic signals on all major streets throughout the county;  -	improved streets and roads;  -	a growth management program that requires new development generat- ing any new traffic to pay for additional streets and roads as development occurs;  -	expanded transit service;  -	discount fares for senior citizens and the disabled.  An independent Citizens Oversight Committee, chosen through an indepen- dent Grand Jury type selection process, is empowered to oversee the expen- diture of all funds generated by this measure.  VOTE “YES" ON REVISED MEASURE M, A NO NONSENSE APPROACH THAT GUARANTEES TRAFFIC RELIEF NOW!!!!  s/ John Kumbera President, Brea Chapter, American Association of Retired Persons s/ Reed Royalty President, Orange County Taxpayers Association s/ Clarice Blamer Chairwoman, 20-Year Master Plan Citizens Committee s/ A. E. Shaffer Captain (ret.), California Highway Patrol s/ Leland Oliver Chairman, Orange County Chamber of Commerce	REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE M DON'T BE FOOLED!  Tax M is the identical plan that voters defeated last year.  Its supporters are still trying to use Orange County’s very real traffic problems to create a political empire. This 20 year sales tax increase would' cost taxpayers over $3 billion dollars, to be wasted by the same bungling bureau- crats who have mismanaged the county's transportation during the last decade. .  Now they're running a deceptive campaign. They spent millions of dollars of developer money last year in a losing campaign, and plan to spend even more this year to nriislead you into taxing yourself to pay for their mistakes. WHAT THEY’RE NOT TELLING YOU  •	Their “new rail system” is a SHAM - neither the technology nor the costs have been identified. This is a blank check for financial disaster.  •	The “new freeway lanes" will virtually all be dangerous diamond lanes.  Freeways will become even more congested.  . • The “growth management plan" actually encourages high density growth by punishing cities who resist development. This benefit to developers will generate even more traffic bn our local roads.  •	The citizens oversight committee would be dominated by a bureaucrat whose budget is controlled by the Board of Supervisors.  If they really wanted to listen to us, the appointed Orange County Transpor- tation Commissioners would resign and allow DIRECT ELECTION of compe- tent and accountable commissioners. Responsible commissioners would listen to taxpayers, not taxspenders, and wouldn’t insult voters by submitting the same sorry tax year after’year.
