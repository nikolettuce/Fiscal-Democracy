TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX (B^E5 TAX) IS NOT PAID BY THE CITIZENS OP MOUNT SHASTA
IT IS PAID BY PERSONS STAYING IN MOUNT SHASTA MOTELS, EXACTLY AS WE PAY WHE
WE STAY IN MOTELS IN OTHER CITIES.

PROPOSAL

Bed tax is paid by persons in local motels. With the current bed tax of six
percent we are among the lowest cities in the state. Many cities, including
Redding and Yreka, are collecting eight percent. With this extra revenue, an
intensive-program can be instituted to bring more meetings and tourism to the
Mount Shasta area, thereby bringing thousands of dollars into our economy froi
outside the area.

GOALS AND OBJECTIVES

Tourism is now one of the largest industries in our nation and the number one
industry in Mount Shasta and Siskiyou County. For years, progressive cities
throughout the United States have realized the financial benefits of active
visitor's bureaus. The solicitation of meetings and tour groups has been ver;
active over the last five years and has met with outstanding and gratifying
success. The City of Mount Shasta is fast becoming a major destination resorl
city, mainly through an intensive "selling" program throughout the state. It
is now felt that with a concentrated effort to "sell" individuals, travel
agents and tour brokers by advertising and personal contact, we can motivate
them to use Mount Shasta as- a destination point, thereby enjoying this
infusion of income.

The entire community benefits from the visitor dollars, either directly (such
as motels, restaurants, gas stations, beauty salons, retail stores, grocery
stores, etc.) or indirectly (by lower unemployment, less taxes, etc.)

VOTE YES — MOUNT SHASTA NEEDS TOURISM DOLLARS NOW!

PROPOSAL 7

Transient .Occupancy Tax is paid by people staying in motels and R.V. sites. With a .
current tax of six percent we are one of the lowest cities in the State. Many cities
collect eight percent with some collecting ten percent or more. These funds are used
to offset costs of the General Fund in providing Police, Fire protection and other .
city provided services such as snow plowing, street lighting, street repair, street
signing & library to mention a few services also used by visitors.

Some of the funds in the past and probably in the future, have been utilized in
promoting tourism which is becoming one of our major industries.
