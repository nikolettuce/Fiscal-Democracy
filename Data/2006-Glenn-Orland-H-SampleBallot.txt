IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE H
City of Orland

Chapter 3.12 Section 3.12,020 of the City of Orland Municipal Code
currently imposes an eight percent (8%) “Hotel Users Tax”, on persons
occupying “Hotels" in the City of Orland. The City Council of the
City of Orland is submitting the following question to the voters at
the general municipal election to be held in the City of Orland on
Tuesday, November 7, 2006:

“Shall the ordinance increasing the Hotel Users Tax from
eight percent (8%) to ten percent (10%) be adopted?”

The tax is normally paid to the operator of the hotel at the time
payment for the room rental is made. The hotel operator is required
to collect the tax, and the operator remits the tax to the City of
Orland. The estimated amount of money to be received by the City
of Orland’s General Fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2006,
as a result of the current Hotel Users Tax is approximately Forty-
Five Thousand Dollars ($45,000).

As a result of the passage of Proposition 218 by the voters of the
State of California on November 6, 1996, Article XIII C and D of
the California Constitution was amended to include the requirement
that “No local government may impose, extend or increase any
general tax unless and until that tax is submitted to the electorate
and approved by a majority vote.”This measure is therefore submitted
to the electorate for their approval or rejection.

A “Yes” vote would approve the adoption by ordinance of a ten
percent (10%) “Hotel Users Tax” and would increase the City’s General
Fund revenues by approximately $11,250.

A “No” vote would reject the measure and would mean that the City's
revenues from the “Hotel Users Tax” would remain at eight percent
(8%).
