KINDERGARTEN-UNIVERSITY PUBLIC EDUCATION
FACILITIES BOND ACT OF 2004. This twelve billion three
hundred million dollar ($12,300,000,000) bond issue will provide
funding for necessary education facilities to relieve overcrowding
and to repair older schools. Funds will be targeted to areas of the
greatest need and must be spent according to strict accountability
measures. Funds will also be used to upgrade and build new
classrooms in the California Community Colleges, the California
State University, and the University of California, to provide
adequate higher education facilities to accommodate the growing
student enrollment. These bonds may be used only for eligible
projects. Fiscal Impact: State costs of about $24.7
billion to pay off both the principal ($12.3 billion) and
interest ($12.4 billion) costs on the bonds.

Payments of about $823 million per year.

THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY BOND ACT. One time
bond of up to fifteen billion dollars ($15,000,000,000) to
retire deficit. Fiscal Impact: One-time increase, compared to
previously authorized bond, of up to $4 billion to reduce the state’s
budget shortfall and annual debt-service savings over the next few
years. These effects would be offset by higher
annual debt-service costs in subsequent years due
to this bond’s longer term and larger size.

THE CALIFORNIA BALANCED BUDGET ACT. Requires
the enactment of a balanced budget, addresses fiscal
emergencies, and establishes a budget reserve. Fiscal Impact: Net
state fiscal effects unknown and will vary by year, depending in
part on actions of future legislatures. Reserve provisions may
smooth state spending, with reductions during economic
expansions and increases during downturns.

Provisions requiring balanced budgets and limiting
deficit borrowing could result in more immediate
actions to correct budgetary shortfalls.

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL
HAMILTON CITY FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT MEASURE D

Background of the Measure

Currently, the Hamilton City Fire Protection District is authorized
by state law to provide fire protection services, rescue services,
emergency medical services, hazardous material emergency
response services, ambulance services, and any other services
relating to the protection of lives and property.

Pursuant to Statewide Proposition 218 adopted in 1996, the
Hamilton City Fire Protection District is supported by a special tax
collected from property owners within the District to fund fire
suppression services.

The increased revenue received by the District from the special
tax may only be used for fire protection services, rescue services,
emergency medical services, hazardous material emergency
response services, ambulance services, and any other services
relating to the protection of lives and property.

A YES vote on Measure D means that the special tax will be
increased within the Hamilton City Fire Protection District as follows:

(a)	Single family dwelling units and mobile homes: increase from
$55 per year to $250 per year.

(b)	Multi-family dwelling units: increase from $43 per year to
$250 per year per dwelling unit.

(c)	Commercial and industrial buildings over 999 sq. ft.: increase
from $70 per year to $320 per year.

(d)	Commercial and industrial buildings under 999 sq.ft.: increase
from $50 per year to $250 per year.

(e)	All other parcels: increase from $.10 per acre to $.20 per
acre per year.

The rates for the proposed tax are set forth more fully in the
attachments to the Board of Supervisors' Resolution No. 2003-128.

A NO vote on Measure D means that the special tax, as
described above, will not be increased.

The Hamilton City Fire Protection District Board has stated that
the Fire District cannot continue to operate without this increase in
the special tax.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE D

For the past 15 years, the Hamilton City Volunteer Fire Department
(HCVFD) has experienced a sharp decline in the number of local
residents who actively participate in HCVFD operations. Over this
same time period the number of response "calls' has dramatically
increased as the population of Hamilton City has grown. Add to that,
the fire fighting "job* today has become more complicated with much
more training now being required.

Almost four years ago, at a Community meeting, the Fire
Commissioners listened to your concerns about the viability of the
fire department. Since then, our efforts to make things better have
shown intermittent success. Last July, fire fighters went door-to-door
and handed out flyers advising of the dire situation and asking for
Community involvement. No one from our Community called to help!
Today we are at a crossroads. With volunteer participation at a
critically low level we need to do something to save the fire department
and we need to do it now! Make no mistake about it; the ability of
the HCVFD to continue operations in its present state is in serious
jeopardy.

To help bring stability to the HCVFD, we need people who we
can rely upon to recruit and train volunteers, to plan, coordinate
and supervise the day-to-day operations and to seek out grants
to further improve operations. To be sure, the mainstay of our
fire department undoubtedly rests with volunteers, however, please
realize that we are beyond the era where an all-volunteer fire
department is practical. The choice is simple: Pay a couple of
hundred dollars a year per house for a partially paid fire department,
or a few hundred dollars a year more for fire insurance if the fire
department closes. Please help us “Save Our Fire Department."
