POLL WORKERS AND FACILITIES NEEDED
=	MEET YOUR NEIGHBORS!	=

r	SERVE YOUR COMMUNITY!	®

There is a shortage of poll workers in many San Diego County
neighborhoods. Voters who are interested in this important work are
encouraged to apply by completing the application form. If you
apply immediately, it is possible that you could be assigned to work
at a polling place in the next election.

The Registrar is trying to build a permanent corps of poll workers;
therefore, homemakers and retired people, as well as others who
are interested in community service are particularly urged to apply.
The department also pays for the use of facilities to be used as a
polling place; i.e., home, clubhouse, business. Since the county
continues to grow and population centers shift, new polling places
are constantly needed.

You will receive a fee for your services.

Once this application is received you will be' contacted by the
Registrar of Voters Office.
