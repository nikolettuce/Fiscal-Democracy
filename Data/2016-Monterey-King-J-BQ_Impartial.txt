Impartial analysis

The following impartial analysis of the measure was prepared by the office
of the King City Attorney:

The City Council of City of King has placed Measure J on the Novembe
8th 2016 ballot to ask the voters to approve an ordinance that would en
a tax on commercial cannabis businesses which may establish in the C
of King. If approved by majority of the voters, the tax would apply to bot
medical and non-medical cannabis businesses, if those are allowed un<
State and local laws. The passage of the tax would not have any effect
legalization or land use regulations of commercial cannabis activities in
the City.

The tax would if approved would tax cultivation at a rate of $25.00 per
square foot for the first 5000 square feet of canopy and $10.00 per squ;
foot for any additional area. Nurseries would be taxed at $5.00 per squj
foot for the first 5000 square feet and $2.50 per square foot for any
additional area. The tax for both cultivation and nurseries would be paic
based on the maximum canopy area under State laws and City
regulations, whether or not the grower utilizes the entire area.

be taxed at a flat annual rate of $30,000 per business, payable quarterly

The full amount of the revenue generated by this Measure would go to i
City’s general fund and be available to support the full range of municip
services including police and fire departments, streets repair, parks and
