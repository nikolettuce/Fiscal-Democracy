PROPOSED ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF FARMERSVILLE ENACTING A ONE-HALF PERCENT	s/ Moses Diaz
(0.5%, OR ONE-HALF PENNY PER DOLLAR) GENERAL SALES TAX.	Michael L. Farley, City Attorney Moses Diaz, Deputy City Attorney
Upon voter approval, section 7285.9 of the Revenue and Taxation Code authorizes a city to levy a general purpose retail transactions and use tax (“sales tax”) on tangible personal property. In order for the sales tax to be approved, a majority vote of the qualified voters of the city voting on this measure must vote in favor of the measure.  If this measure is approved, Ordinance No. 483 of the City of Farmersville (“City”) will be implemented, imposing a transactions and use tax upon all retailers within the incorporated territory of the City at the rate of one-half (1/2) percent (or one-half of a penny per dollar). The authority to levy the tax will be effective until repealed by a duly enacted ordinance. However, the City Council would have authority to temporarily suspend collection of the tax by resolution unanimously approved by all members of the entire City Council.  The revenues derived from the sales tax must be placed in the City’s General Fund and may be used for any general city purpose, including but not limited to maintaining and/or improving: 9-1-1 emergency response and neighborhood police patrols; fire protection services; streets and roads repairs; support of senior and youth services; city parks; recreation programs; and any other city services for Farmersville residents and the public.  If this measure is approved, the ordinance will become operative but the retail transactions and use tax cannot be levied earlier than first day of the first calendar quarter commencing more than one hundred ten (110) days after the adoption of the ordinance by the voters.  All amendments subsequent to voter approval to Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code relating to sales and use taxes and which are not inconsistent with Part 1.6 and Part 1.7 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, and all amendments to Part 1.6 and Part 1.7 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, shall automatically become a part of the ordinance implementing this measure. The proposed ordinance contains certain exemptions and exclusions from the computation of the amount of the transactions and use tax on certain transactions, including those exemptions already applicable under state law.  This measure was added to the ballot by the City Council and makes no change to existing laws but will add to existing laws a citywide ordinance imposing a one-half (1/2) percent transactions and use tax within the City of Farmersville. The electors entitled to vote on this measure are the registered voters within City of Farmersville. If the measure is not approved by a majority vote of the votes cast on the measure, the measure will fail and the tax will not be imposed.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE P

CIUDAD DE FARMERSVILLE____

ARGUMENTO A FAVOR DE LA MEDIDA P

ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF FARMERSVILLE
ENACTING A ONE-HALF PERCENT (0.5%, OR
ONE-HALF PENNY PER DOLLAR) GENERAL
SALES TAX.

This is a general tax to pay for basic city services. It
will pay for police, fire, street and sidewalk repair,
senior and youth recreation and other essential city
services.

The Great Recession left us with reduced property tax
revenues. This has made it a difficult challenge to
provide the most basic of services. We have had to
leave city staff positions unfilled, use old, unreliable
equipment to maintain critical municipal services and
cut funding for other essential city services. We have
delayed maintenance on our streets, city buildings
and storm drains. Farmersville maintains only the
most basic city services. Now those are at risk too.

We have had to leave police officer positions unfilled.
We may have to make drastic cuts in all departments
(police, fire, and public works).

Many City improvements have been made using
grants without a cost to the city, but core services
depend on general fund revenue that this tax measure
would help support. The State and County keep most
of the sales tax collected in Farmersville with only
roughly one and a half pennies of every dollar paid to
Farmersville. The passage of this measure will
provide an estimated $280,000 in new funds. While
this additional revenue will not entirely solve our
financial situation, it will certainly help! Importantly,
this local tax cannot be taken away by the State.
These funds will be accounted for in our audit and the
audit report will be available to the public.

Please approve this measure and help Farmersville
move toward a better future for everyone who resides
here.

Please join us in voting Yes on Measure P.

ORDENANZA DE LA CIUDAD DE FARMERSVILLE EN
LA QUE SE PROMULGA UN IMPUESTO GENERAL DE
MEDIO PUNTO PORCENTUAL (0.5 %, O MEDIO
CENTAVO POR DOLAR) SOBRE LAS VENTAS.

Este es un impuesto general para pagar los servicios
basicos de la ciudad. Pagara los servicios de policfa y
bomberos, reparaciones de banquetas, entretenimiento
para jovenes y personas de la tercera edad, y otros
servicios indispensables en la ciudad.

La Gran Recesion redujo las recaudaciones del impuesto
a la propiedad. Como consecuencia, proporcionar los
servicios mas basicos se ha vuelto un reto dificil. Tuvimos
que dejar vacantes puestos del personal de la ciudad,
usar equipo obsoleto y poco fiable para mantener
servicios municipales fundamentales y recortar los fondos
para dedicarlos a otros servicios indispensables de la
ciudad. Retrasamos el mantenimiento de nuestras calles,
de los edificios de la ciudad y del alcantarillado pluvial.
Farmersville solamente conserva los servicios mas
basicos de la ciudad. Y ahora, tambien esos estan en
riesgo. Hemos tenido que dejar vacantes puestos de
agentes de policla. Es probable que tengamos que hacer
recortes drasticos en todos los departamentos (policia,
bomberos y obras publicas).

Se han hecho muchas mejoras usando subsidios que no
cuestan nada a la ciudad, pero los servicios
fundamentales dependen de los ingresos del fondo
general, a los que apoyaria esta medida de impuestos. El
estado y el condado conservan la mayorfa de los
impuestos sobre las ventas que se recaudan en
Farmersville; solamente alrededor de un centavo y medio
por cada dolar se paga a Farmersville. La aprobacion de
esta medida proporcionara aproximadamente $280,000
de nuevos fondos. Si bien este ingreso adicional no
resolver^ por completo nuestra situacibn financiera, jsin
duda ayudara! Es importante mencionar que el estado no
puede tomar el dinero proveniente de este impuesto local.
Estos fondos se contabilizaran en nuestra auditoria y el
informe de auditoria estara disponible al publico.

Apruebe esta medida y ayude a Farmersville a avanzar
hacia un mejor future para todos sus residentes.

MEASURE Q

PROPOSED ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF
FARMERSVILLE ENACTING A COMMERCIAL
CANNABIS BUSINESS TAX.

In November 2016, California voters approved
Proposition 64 which, among other things, decriminalized
the use, sale and cultivation of non-medicinal cannabis
by adults and set a maximum cultivation allowance for
non-medicinal cannabis. Proposition 64 also authorized
local control over land uses involving non-medicinal
cannabis. The City anticipates enactment of zoning
standards and regulations, which would govern those
types of land uses, prior to January 1, 2018.

Upon voter approval of Measure Q, Ordinance No. 484
would authorize the City of Farmersville (“City”) to levy an
excise tax on the privilege of conducting a commercial
cannabis business within the City. In order for the tax to
be approved, a majority vote of the qualified voters of the
City voting on this measure must vote in favor of the
measure.

Measure Q would impose a business tax on every person
engaged in a commercial cannabis business within the
City, without regard to whether it is medicinal or non-
medicinal cannabis. The maximum tax rate would be up
to the greater of either: (i) $25.00 per square foot of
business areas, annually adjusted upward based upon
the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”) for all urban
consumers in the San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose
areas; or (ii) 10% of gross receipts per fiscal year. The
City Council would be authorized to adopt a resolution
implementing a tax rate which is lower than the maximum
tax rate and may, by unanimous resolution of the entire
Council, temporarily suspend collection of the tax.

Measure Q is a general tax under state law and, if
enacted by the voters, the revenues received from the
tax must be placed in the City’s general fund and may be
used in any lawful purpose, as directed by the City
Council, including but not limited to addressing cannabis
industry impacts and/or maintaining and/or improving: 9-
1-1 emergency response and neighborhood police
patrols; fire protection services; streets and roads repairs;
support of senior and youth services; city parks;
recreation programs; and any other city services for
Farmersville residents and the public.

If this measure is approved by the voters, Ordinance No.
484 shall be adopted by the City Council on the date the
City Council declares the election results. The ordinance
will become effective (10) ten days thereafter but the tax
shall not be levied until the City Council has adopted a
resolution setting an effective tax rate and implementing
the tax.

This measure was added to the ballot by the City Council

Farmersville. The electors entitled to vote on this
measure are the registered voters within City of
Farmersville. If the measure is not approved by a majority
vote of the votes cast on the measure, the measure will

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE Q

CIUDAD DE FARMERSVILLE
ARGUMENTO A FAVOR DE LA MEDIDA Q

Vote Yes on Measure Q, the City of Farmersville
Cannabis Business Tax.

You, the taxpayer, have borne the cost of addressing
the negative impacts of illegal cannabis operations for
far too long. Taxpayers have had to fully fund the
rising costs of police, fire, emergency medical, code
enforcement and other public services, without
contributions from cannabis businesses. It’s time for
the cannabis industry to pay its fair share of taxes to
mitigate these and other adverse secondary impacts.

Measure Q is simple: If an authorized commercial
cannabis business operates within the City limits, that
business would contribute its fair share to the funding
of vital public services such as police, fire, roads and
parks and recreation.

Measure Q would provide funds to implement strict
standards, regulations and location requirements for
cannabis businesses. Too many unregulated
cannabis operations have burdened vital public
resources and increased crime. Revenue from this tax
will protect our vital public services and finally help put
an end to these illegal operations.

The children of our City are our most important asset.
Implementing this tax will fund recreation activities for
them and contribute to clean, healthy and safe
neighborhoods throughout our community

Since there is no guarantee that State tax revenue
from cannabis sales will fund any local services, it is
necessary to secure our own funding through this tax
measure. All revenue collected from Measure Q will
stay local to maintain important and essential City
services.

Help eliminate illegal cannabis operations and ensure
the cannabis industry operates legally and contributes
positively to the quality of life in the City of
Farmersville.

Please join us in voting Yes on Measure Q.

Vote a favor de la medida Q, Ciudad de Farmersville el
impuesto comercial al cannabis.

Usted, el contribuyente, ha soportado durante mucho
tiempo el costo de hacer frente a los efectos negativos del
negocio ilegal del cannabis. Los contribuyentes han tenido
que financiar por completo el aumento de los costos de
los servicios de policia, bomberos, medicina de
emergencia, cumplimiento de los reglamentos y otros
servicios publicos, sin contar con las contribuciones del
comercio del cannabis. Es tiempo de que la industria del
cannabis pague su parte justa de impuestos para mitigar
estos y otros efectos secundarios adversos.

La medida Q es simple: si se realiza de forma autorizada
el comercio del cannabis dentro de los llmites de la
ciudad, ese comercio aportarla su parte correspondiente
para financiar servicios publicos vitales, como la policia,
bomberos, caminos y parques, y recreacion.

La medida Q proporcionaria fondos para implementar
estandares, regulaciones y requisitos de ubicacidn
estrictos para el comercio del cannabis. Muchas
operaciones de cannabis no reguladas suponen una
carga para los recursos publicos mas importantes, y el
crimen ha aumentado. Los ingresos de este impuesto
protegeran nuestros servicios publicos mas importantes, y
finalmente ayudaran a poner fin a estas operaciones
ilegales.

Los nifios de nuestra ciudad son nuestro bien mas
preciado. Al implementar este impuesto se financial
actividades recreativas para ellos y se contribuira a crear
vecindarios limpios, sanos y seguros en toda nuestra
comunidad.

Debido a que no hay garantia de que los ingresos de
impuestos estatales de la venta de cannabis financiaran
los servicios locales, es necesario asegurar nuestro
propio financiamiento a traves de esta medida de
impuestos. Todos los ingresos recaudados con la medida
Q permaneceran a nivel local para mantener los servicios
importantes e indispensables de la ciudad.

Ayude a eliminar las operaciones ilegales de cannabis y a
asegurar que la industria de cannabis funcione legalmente
y contribuya de forma positiva a la calidad de vida de la
ciudad de Farmersville.

or local law, if any amount required to be paid to the County under this
Chapter is not paid when due, the Collector may, within three (3) years
after the amount is due, record a certificate of lien specifying the amount of
taxes, fees and penalties due, and the name and address of the Person as it
appears on the records of the Collector. The lien shall also specify that the
Collector has complied with all provisions of this Chapter in the
determination of the amount required to be paid. From the time of the filing
of the record, the amount required to be paid, together with penalties
thereon, constitutes a lien upon all real property in the County owned by the
Person, or subsequently acquired by the Person before the lien expires. The
lien has the force, effect and priority of a judgment lien and shall continue
for ten (10) years from the filing of the certificate unless sooner released or
otherwise discharged. A fee may be adopted by the City Council and
collected by the Collector to pay for the cost of recording and administering
the lien.

C.	At any time within three (3) years after any Person is delinquent
in the payment of any amount herein required to be paid or within three (3)
years after the last recording of a certificate of lien under Subsection B of
this Section, the Collector may issue a warrant for the enforcement of any
liens and for the collection of any amount required to be paid to the City
under this Chapter. The warrant shall be directed to the Chief of Police and

asset or property, or a sufficient part of it to pay the amount due together

assets or property which is exempt from execution under the provisions of
the California Code of Civil Procedure.

5.30.170: APPORTIONMENT.

If a Commercial Cannabis Business subject to a Commercial
Cannabis Business Tax is operating both within and outside the City, it is
the intent of the City to apply the Commercial Cannabis Business Tax so
that the measure of the tax fairly reflects the proportion of the taxed activity
actually carried on in the City. For purposes of apportionment as may be
required by law, the Collector may promulgate administrative procedures
for apportionment in accordance with state law.

5.30.180: CONSTITUTIONALITY AND LEGALITY.

This tax is intended to be applied in a manner consistent with the
United States and California Constitutions and state law. None of the tax
provided for in this Chapter shall be applied in a manner that causes an

and due process clauses of the Constitutions of the United States or the
State of California, or a violation of any other provisions of the California
Constitution or state law.

Persons engaged in Commercial Cannabis Businesses, and, where
necessary, all equipment of any Person engaged in Commercial Cannabis
Businesses in the City, for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of
Commercial Cannabis Business Tax, if any, required to be paid under this
Chapter, and for the purpose of verifying any statements or any item
thereof when filed by any Person pursuant to this Chapter. If such Person,
after written demand by the Collector, refuses to make available for audit,
examination or verification such books, records or equipment as the
Collector requests, the Collector may, after full consideration of all
information within his or her knowledge concerning the Commercial
Cannabis Businesses and activities of the Person so refusing, make an
assessment against the Commercial Cannabis Business of the taxes
estimated to be due under this Chapter. The Collector may collect a fee
adopted by the City Council to pay for the cost of examination and audit

should the books and records be provided in a form insufficient to allow the
Collector to make a determination of tax due.

B.	It shall be the duty of every Person liable for the collection and
payment to the City of any tax imposed by this Chapter to keep and
preserve, for a period of at least three (3) years, all records as may be
necessary to determine the amount of such tax as he or she may have been
liable for the collection of and payment to the City, which records the
Collector shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times.

5.30.200: OTHER LICENSES, PERMITS, TAXES, FEES, OR
CHARGES.

Nothing contained in this Chapter shall be deemed to repeal, amend,
be in lieu of, replace, or in any way affect any requirements for any permit
or license required by, under or by virtue of any provision of any other title
or chapter of this code or any other Ordinance or resolution of the City, nor

resolution by the City. Any references made or contained in any other title
or chapter of this code to any licenses, license taxes, fees, or charges, or to
any schedule of license fees, shall be deemed to refer to the licenses, license
taxes, fees or charges, or schedule of license fees, provided for in other
titles or chapters of this code.

5.30.210: CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP.

A.	If any Person, while liable for any amount under this Chapter, sells,
assigns or otherwise transfers the Commercial Cannabis Business, whether
voluntarily or involuntarily, the Person’s successor, assignee or other
transferee, or other Person or entity obtaining ownership or control of the
business (“Transferee”), shall satisfy any tax liability owed to the City
associated with the business when due hereunder. Failure to do so for the
benefit of the City will result in being personally liable to the City for the
full amount of the unpaid tax liability, interest and penalties. The
Transferee shall notify the Collector of the date of transfer at least 30 days
before the transfer date; or if the agreement to sell, transfer, or otherwise
dispose of the business was made less than 30 days before the date of
transfer, notice shall be provided immediately upon the existence of the
agreement. All Transferees are required to meet each and every condition
outlined in this Ordinance and have prior written approval of the City prior
to the transfer.

B.	The Transferee shall be deemed to have complied with the
requirement of this section to satisfy the unpaid tax liability if the

Transferee complied with the requirements of California Revenue and
Taxation Code Section 7283.5 by withholding from the purchase price, for
the benefit of the City, an amount sufficient to cover the tax liability, or by
otherwise paying the tax liability and obtaining from the Collector a “Tax
Clearance Certificate” showing that all outstanding tax liability has been
paid and stating that no amount is due through the date of transfer.

C.	The Collector, within 90 days of receiving a written request from the
Transferee, may issue a “Tax Clearance Certificate” stating either
the amount of tax liability due and owing for the business, or stating that
there is no tax liability due and owing for the business through a stated
date. The Collector may also request financial records from the current or
former owner or operator of a Commercial Cannabis Business to audit the
tax that may be due and owing. The Collector shall issue a “Tax Clearance
Certificate” within 30 days of completing the audit, state the amount of the
tax liability owed, if any, unless the Collector determines that the records
provided in connection with the audit are insufficient to determine whether
taxes are due and owed or in what amount. If the Collector determines that
the records are insufficient, the Collector may rely on the facts and
information available to estimate any tax liability. The Collector may issue
a “Tax Clearance Certificate” stating the amount of the tax liability, if any,
based on such facts and information available. Unless an appeal is filed in
accordance with Section 5.30.270, the “Tax Clearance Certificate” shall
serve as conclusive evidence of the tax liability associated with the property
through the date stated on the “Tax Clearance Certificate.”

5.30.220: PAYMENT OF TAXES DOES NOT AUTHORIZE
UNLAWFUL BUSINESS.

A.	The payment of a tax required by this Chapter, and its acceptance
by the City, shall not entitle any Person to carry on any Commercial
Cannabis Business unless the Person has complied with all of the
requirements of this Code and all other applicable state laws.

as authorizing the conduct or continuance of any illegal or unlawful
business, or any business in violation of any local or state law.

required under this Chapter is correct, or that the amount of tax is correctly
computed, he or she may compute and determine the amount to be paid and make
a deficiency determination upon the facts contained in the tax return or statement
or any information in his or her possession or that may come into his or her
possession within three (3) years of the date the tax was originally due and
payable, or such later date as allowable by law. One or more deficiency

determinations of the amount of tax due for a period or periods may be made.
When a Person discontinues engaging in a business, a deficiency determination
may be made at any time within three (3) years thereafter, or such later date as
allowable by law, as to any liability arising from engaging in such business
whether or not a deficiency determination is issued prior to the date the tax would
otherwise be due. Whenever a deficiency determination is made, a notice shall be
given to the Person concerned in the same manner as notices of assessment are
given under Section 5.30.250.

5.30.240: FAILURE TO REPORT.

A.	Under any of the following circumstances and at any time, the
Collector may make and give notice of an assessment of the amount
of tax owed by a Person under this Chapter.

1.	If the Person has not filed a complete return or statement
required under this Chapter; or

2.	If the Person has not timely paid any tax, fee, interest
and/or penalty due under this Chapter; or

3.	If the Person has not, after demand by the Collector, filed
a corrected return or statement, or furnished to the
Collector adequate substantiation of the information
contained in a return or statement filed previously; or

4.	If the Collector determines that the nonpayment of any
business tax due under this Chapter is due to fraud, a
penalty of twenty-five percent (25%) of the amount of the
tax shall be added thereto in addition to penalties and
interest otherwise stated in this Chapter and any other
penalties allowed by law.

B.	The notice of assessment shall separately set forth the amount of
any tax known by the Collector to be due or estimated by the
Collector, after consideration of all information within the
Collector’s knowledge concerning the business and activities of the
Person assessed, to be due under each applicable section of this
Chapter, and shall include the amount of any penalties or interest
accrued on each amount to the date of the notice of assessment.

5.30.250: TAX ASSESSMENT - NOTICE REQUIREMENTS.

The notice of assessment shall be served upon the Person either by
Personal delivery, or by a deposit of the notice in the United States mail, postage
prepaid thereon, addressed to the Person at the address of the location of the
business or to such other address as he, she or it shall register with the Collector
for the purpose of receiving notices provided under this Chapter, or, should the
Person have no address registered with the Collector for such purpose, then to

such Person’s last known address. For the purposes of this Section, a service by
mail is complete at the time of deposit in the United States mail.

5.30.260: TAX ASSESSMENT - HEARING, APPLICATION, AND

Within ten (10) calendar days from the date of service, the Person
may apply in writing to the Collector for a hearing on the assessment. If

prescribed, the tax assessed by the Collector shall become final and conclusive.
Within thirty (30) business days of the receipt of any such application for hearing,
the Collector shall cause the matter to be set for hearing before him or her not later
than thirty-five (35) business days after the receipt of the application, unless a later
date is agreed to by the Collector and the Person requesting the hearing. Notice of
such hearing shall be given by the Collector to the Person requesting such hearing
not later than five (5) business days prior to such hearing. At such hearing said
applicant may appear and offer evidence why the assessment as made by the
Collector should not be confirmed and fixed as the tax due. After such hearing, the
Collector shall determine and reassess the proper tax to be charged and shall give
written notice to the Person in the manner prescribed in Section 5.30.250 for
giving notice of assessment. The amount determined to be due shall be payable
after thirty (30) calendar days of written notice unless it is appealed to the City
Council.

5.30.270: APPEAL PROCEDURE.

Any taxpayer aggrieved by any decision of the Collector with respect to the
amount of tax, fee, interest and penalties, if any, due under this Chapter may

Farmersville City Council within fifteen (15) calendar days of the mailing of the
decision or determination. The Clerk shall schedule the appeal and give fifteen
(15) days written notice to the appellant of the time and place of hearing by
serving the notice Personally or by depositing in the United States Post Office in
the City, postage prepaid, addressed as shown on the appeal papers or, if none,
such other address as is known to the City or, absent any address, by publication in
a newspaper of general circulation in the City. The City Manager shall have
authority to determine all questions raised on such appeal. No such determination
shall conflict with any substantive provision of this Chapter.

5.30.280: CONVICTION FOR CHAPTER VIOLATION - TAXES

NOT WAIVED.

The conviction and punishment of any Person for failure to pay a required
tax, fee, penalty and/or interest under this Chapter shall not excuse or exempt such
Person from any civil action for the amounts due under this Chapter. No civil

action shall prevent a criminal prosecution for any violation of the provisions of
this Chapter or of any State law requiring the payment of all taxes.

5.30.290: VIOLATION DEEMED MISDEMEANOR.

Any Person who violates any provision of this Chapter or who other than
by a sworn statement, knowingly or intentionally misrepresents to any officer or
employee of the City any material fact herein required to be provided is guilty of a
misdemeanor punishable as provided in Section 1.12.010 of this Code. A Person
who on a sworn statement states as true a material fact that he or she knows to be
false is guilty of perjury.

5.30.300: REMEDIES CUMULATIVE.

All remedies prescribed under this Chapter shall be cumulative and the use
of one or more remedies by the City shall not bar the use of any other remedy for
the purpose of enforcing the provisions hereof.

This Chapter may be repealed or amended by Ordinance of the Farmersville
City Council without a vote of the People except that, as required by Article XIIIC
of the California Constitution, voter approval is required for any amendment that
would increase the rate of any tax levied pursuant to this Chapter above the
maximum rates established by this Chapter. The people of the City of Farmersville
affirm that the following actions shall not constitute an increase of the rate of a
tax:

A.	The restoration of the rate of the tax to a rate that is no higher
than that set by this Chapter, if the City Council has acted to
reduce the rate of the tax;

B.	An action that interprets or clarifies the methodology of the tax,
or any definition applicable to the tax, so long as interpretation or
clarification (even if contrary to some prior interpretation or
clarification) is not inconsistent with the language of this
Chapter; or

C.	The collection of the tax imposed by this Chapter, even if the
City had, for some period of time, failed to collect the tax; or

The City Council shall have authority to temporarily suspend collection of
the tax imposed by this chapter by resolution unanimously approved by all
members of the entire City Council, subject to the restrictions in the City
agreement with the State Board of Equalization. However, the authority to levy the
tax imposed by this chapter shall not expire or otherwise terminate, unless
terminated by a duly enacted Ordinance which is approved at a regular meeting of,
and by unanimous vote of all of the seats on, the City Council.

IN THE MATTER OF:

Resolution Calling City Election for Voter
Approval of Commercial Cannabis Business
Tax; add Chapter 5.30 to the Farmersville
Municipal Code; and Specifications of the
Election Order.

RESOLUTION 2017- 026

WHEREAS, approval of an excise tax on cannabis business ensures that the City
of Farmersville (“City”) has more local funding for vital City services which cannot be
taken by the State, ensuring our tax dollars are spent locally for the benefit of residents of
Farmersville;

WHEREAS, when a City seeks voter approval of a new local excise tax, Article
XIIIC § 2(b) of the California Constitution requires the election to be consolidated with
the general municipal election for City Council members, except in cases in which a City
Council has unanimously declared that there is a fiscal emergency;

WHEREAS, in recent years the City has experienced insufficient growth in sales
tax revenues and other State revenues while the scope and cost of providing essential City
services has increased;

WHEREAS, projected deficits in the General Fund and other operating funds
threatens a reduction in staffing and services in all departments including public safety
personnel and other essential City services potentially placing Farmersville residents at
risk in emergency situations;

WHEREAS, the City’s expenditure trends, and reduction of federal funding of
public safety positions, point to a potential deficit in the General Fund and/or other
operating funds in the upcoming fiscal years which will limit the City’s ability to meet
public safety standards, fund recreational programs and facilities, maintain and improve
parks, repair and improve streets, and provide other general and essential services;

WHEREAS, the City Council received information during the budget review
process for the last couple of years which demonstrated that the City will be operating at
a significant General Fund and/or other operating fund deficits commencing in fiscal year
2017 and said deficit is estimated to continue in current and subsequent fiscal years even
with significant cuts to expenditures;

Page 1 of 6

WHEREAS, in light of the projected significant General Fund and/or other
operating fund deficits over the next several fiscal years the City Council has this day
unanimously declared a fiscal emergency under Article XIIIC § 2(b) of the California
Constitution;

WHEREAS, on November 8, 2016, the voters of California adopted Proposition
64 which legalized the use of cannabis for adult use and established maximum cultivation
allowance of six (6) plants for personal use. The “Control, Regulate and Tax Adult Use
of Marijuana Act,” approved by the State’s voters, allows for local control of adult use
cannabis land uses, and reasonable regulation of personal cultivation of up to six (6)
plants within a residence;

WHEREAS, the City Council published a notice of a public hearing, to be held on
July 17, 2017 to consider calling a special election to seek voter approval of a proposed
commercial cannabis business tax as authorized by California Government Code §
37100.5;

WHEREAS, the statutory deadline to authorize submittal of said commercial
cannabis business tax measure to the County of Tulare’s elections office is scheduled to
expire on or about August 11, 2017 for the November 7, 2017 regular election date and
the County’s administrative deadline for submittal of relevant documentation is August
11,2017;

WHEREAS, the new business tax would be imposed on commercial cannabis
businesses. The tax rate would be $25 per square foot of commercial cannabis business
area or ten percent (10%) of annual gross receipts per fiscal year) of the sales price of the
property, whichever is greater. The business tax revenue would be collected by city clerk,
or other city official charged by the city manager with the administration of the
provisions of Chapter 5.30 of the Farmersville Municipal Code. Collection of all or any
portion of the tax could be temporarily suspended by a unanimous vote of the City
Council. The tax would require approval of at least a majority of voters voting on the
measure and approval of this resolution by at least two-thirds vote of all members of the
City Council;

WHEREAS, based upon all of the information presented to the City Council as of
the date of this resolution, both written and oral, including the staff reports, minutes and
other relevant materials, the commercial cannabis business tax does not constitute a
project under CEQA Guidelines 15060(c)(2), 15061(b)(3) and 15378(b)(2) and (4) and
therefore review under CEQA is not required; and

WHEREAS, on July 17, 2017, the City Council opened and held a public hearing
to consider placing a commercial cannabis business tax ordinance before the voters of the
City of Farmersville at an election to be held on November 7, 2017, and said hearing was
continued to July 24th, 2017.
