The Top Two Candidates Open Primary Act, which took effect January 1, 2011, requires that all candidates for a voter-nominated
office be listed on the same ballot. Voter-nominated offices are state legislative offices, U.S. congressional offices, and state
constitutional offices.

In both the open primary and general elections, you can vote for any candidate, regardless of what party preference you indicated
on your voter registration form. In the primary election, the two candidates receiving the most votes—regardless of party
preference—move on to the general election regardless of vote totals. If a candidate receives a majority of the vote (50 percent +
1), a general election still must be held. Even if there are only two candidates for an office in the open primary, a general election
for that office is still required.

California’s open primary system does not apply to candidates running for local offices.

Voter-Nominated Offices

Political parties are not entitled to formally nominate candidates for voter-nominated offices at the primary election. A
candidate nominated for a voter-nominated office at the primary election is the nominee of the people and not the official nominee
of any party at the general election. A candidate for nomination to a voter-nominated office shall have his or her party preference,
or lack of party preference, stated on the ballot, but the party preference designation is selected solely by the candidate and is
shown for the information of the voters only. It does not mean the candidate is nominated or endorsed by the party designated,
or that there is an affiliation between the party and candidate, and no candidate nominated by the voters shall be deemed to be
the officially nominated candidate of any political party. In the county sample ballot booklet, parties may list the candidates for
voter-nominated offices who have received the party’s official endorsement.

Any voter may vote for any candidate for a voter-nominated office, if they meet the other qualifications required to vote
for that office. The top two vote-getters at the primary election move on to the general election for the voter-nominated office even
if both candidates have specified the same party preference designation. No party is entitled to have a candidate with its party
preference designation move on to the general election, unless the candidate is one of the two highest vote-getters at the primary
election.

Nonpartisan State Offices

Political parties are not entitled to nominate candidates for nonpartisan offices at the primary election, and a candidate
at the primary election is not the official nominee of any party for the specific office at the general election. A candidate for
nomination to a nonpartisan office may not designate his or her party preference, or lack of party preference, on the ballot. The
top two vote-getters at the primary election move on to the general election for the nonpartisan office.

New electoral district boundaries are drawn every 10 years in order to equalize district populations. Boundaries for the
congressional, state legislative, and county supervisorial districts are now different. Boundary changes also apply to any city,
school district, or special district that votes by trustee areas or divisions. To see the new district maps, visit the Registrar of
Voters website at www.voteinfo.net.

California law requires that the following information be printed in this pamphlet.

CANDIDATE STATEMENT FOR
UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE,

42ND CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT

TIM SHERIDAN, Democratic	AGE:	48

OCCUPATION:	National Field Representative

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

My name is Tim Sheridan. With your vote, we can make a positive
change in Congress!

Right now, Congress is broken. It simply does not work. There is too
much fighting among the professional politicians who have been in
office for a long time. Instead of working together to achieve a result,
they blame others.

The only way to change Washington is to change the people we send
to Washington. We’ve all heard the saying, “Throw the bums out!”
Now is the time!

I’m not a professional politician and I have never run for public office.
I’m a hard worker who believes in putting the needs of people first.

Regular citizens, like you, are helping me. They want someone in
Congress who will be responsive to voters - someone who will work
on behalf of everyday Americans.

I have traveled around California’s 42nd District extensively this past
year, meeting people and listening to their concerns. I pledge that
when I’m elected to Congress, I will continue to do this. Listening to
you will be a priority - especially to those who disagree with me.

My focus will be on bringing good paying jobs to Riverside County,
improving public education, and protecting Social Security for
seniors. I will support women’s rights, fair wages, and increased pay
and benefits for our military personnel, veterans and their families.

This time let’s take a break from the professional politicians! I would
appreciate your vote.

Thank you!

CANDIDATE STATEMENT FOR
UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE,

42ND CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT

KEN CALVERT, Republican	AGE:	61

OCCUPATION:	U.S.	Representative

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

It’s an honor to represent Riverside County in Congress and I
stand ready to continue serving as your voice for a more effective,
accountable government in Washington.

I’m running because President Obama continues to lead our country
down the wrong path.

Instead of enacting policies that will create jobs, President Obama
burdens small businesses with unnecessary red tape and regulations
that raise the cost to hire more employees.

Instead of stopping our immigration crisis, President Obama invites
more illegal immigrants with his pro-amnesty policies.

Instead of ensuring Americans receive patient-centered healthcare,
President Obama is imposing a healthcare system controlled by
Washington bureaucrats.

I’m a lifelong Riverside County resident who believes that people
know what’s best for them and they, not the government, should be
left to make their own decisions.

As a former small business owner, I know what it’s like to sign the
front of a paycheck and how much those paychecks mean to hard
working families.

I oppose amnesty, want to send our National Guard to secure the
border and make the use of E-Verify mandatory.

I’m committed to finding economic solutions that will help improve
the quality of life for middle-class American families today and in the
future.

My priorities include: improving our economy; addressing our
immigration crisis, supporting the military; and tackling our energy
and water challenges.

I humbly ask for your vote and thank you for the opportunity to
represent you.

CANDIDATE STATEMENT FOR
STATE SENATOR,

28TH SENATORIAL DISTRICT

JEFF STONE, Republican

OCCUPATION:	Riverside County Supervisor / Small Business

Owner

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

As a Riverside County Supervisor and longtime small business
owner, I’m proud to be running for the Senate with the support of
local taxpayers, seniors, veterans, small business owners and over
45 city council members and elected officials from the Coachella
Valley and Riverside County. Councilman Glenn Miller, who ran a
strong campaign in June, has now endorsed me.

I’m also honored to be the choice of Riverside Countv Sheriff Stan Sniff
and the Riverside Sheriffs Association. Over 3,200 law enforcement
officers and investigators in Riverside County endorse me because
they know I will OPPOSE EARLY RELEASE of dangerous prisoners
and work to keep our neighborhoods, schools and homes safe.

I signed the NO NEW TAXES pledge. As a local official, I successfully
lowered taxes without cutting vital services. I’ll work to do the same
in Sacramento.

I strongly oppose the federal government’s policy of moving illegal
immigrants from the Texas border to Riverside County communities.
The Feds need to enforce the law and control the border.

My priorities are: JOB CREATION and Improving the Business
Climate; No New Taxes, Cut Waste and Balance the Budget.

Special interests in Sacramento are spending massive sums of
money to influence your vote and defeat me. Ask yourself: do you
want a Senator who will be a voice for the special interests; or one
who will be a voice for you and Riverside County?

I’d be honored to receive your vote. Please visit www.JeffStone2014.com
to read more. Thank you.

CANDIDATE STATEMENT FOR
STATE SENATOR,

28TH SENATORIAL DISTRICT

BONNIE GARCIA, Republican
OCCUPATION:	Small Business Woman

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

California is broken and in dire need of commonsense solutions.

During the six years I served in the Assembly, I kept my promise
and refused to support tax increases and reckless spending. My
commitment to California’s hardworking taxpayers earned me the
support of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association and local elected
officials from across the county.

A strong workforce is more important than senseless regulations. The
California Small Business Association supports me because I created
thousands of jobs, expanded opportunities for veterans and secured
funding for small businesses.

I’m from a law enforcement and military family, value freedom
and understand personal sacrifice. The California Police Chief’s
Association and Crime Victims United have endorsed me due to my
strong support of public safety and fervent opposition toward the
Governor’s early release program for hardened criminals.

We must focus on issues that directly affect the future of our state and
its industries: namely, our dwindling water supply. As your Senator, I
will fight to ensure that California’s water supply is readily available for
those who need it most: families and small businesses that depend
on this critical resource to create jobs and sustain our high standard
of living.

With your support I will continue to use my experience and degree in
Workforce Development and Education to promote a broad array of
conservative priorities - sound fiscal policies, quality schools, safer
communities and protecting the value of every life.

Experience and ethics matter.

CANDIDATE STATEMENT FOR
MEMBER OF THE STATE ASSEMBLY,

67TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT

CONRAD MELTON, Democratic
OCCUPATION:	Retired	Firefighter

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

Are you concerned about the excessive influence corporations
have over government?

They spend millions hiring lobbyists who “support” legislators who
then write new laws and loopholes for greater profits. The people pay
and pay.

I say corporations are NOT PEOPLE and money is NOT SPEECH.
That’s why election reform is at the top of my agenda!

Giant agriculture now grows food with Genetically Modified
Organisms. They oppose even labeling those foods. 46 European
nations and I agree: accurate, honest labels on food is manditory.

Factory farms put unnecessary antibiotics into food animals. They
get bigger chickens, heavier hogs, and higher profits, but the people
get antibiotic-resistant staph infections that kill 99,000 every year.

Oil companies are spending millions to keep “fracking” legal even
though it has caused earthquakes and poisoned drinking water. We
must safeguard our water and NOT agitate the seismic plates!

Government’s priorities should value PEOPLE BEFORE
CORPORATIONS!

Minimum wage should be raised significantly!

Military families should not need to apply for food stamps.

New infrastructure construction and timely repairs will create jobs.
Women’s health issues should be between the woman and her
Doctor.

We need a sensible immigration program and a reasonable path
to citizenship.

It’s time to provide “Medicare for All.”

Families don’t need anti-tank guns and hunters don’t need 50 shot
clips.

Think my positions should be our State’s laws?

60,000	voters in AD-67 will not vote because they think it won’t
matter.

Please don’t be one of them.

MT. SAN JACINTO COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT, TRUSTEE AREA 4

VIRNIECIA GREEN-JORDAN	AGE:	60

OCCUPATION:	Educator

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

Economic vitality and sustainability depends on future generations’
prosperity. Presently, a serious concern impacting Riverside County’s
destiny is that MSJC has one of the lowest attendance rate in California
indicating community lack of interest/irrelevant course options.

In addition to MSJC primary mission of academic, vocational and
remedial instruction, it should prepare students for local productivity
and global competitiveness. Thus, MSJC as an extension of the
community it serves must be actively involved by continually
educating, training, and contributing to workforce growth. It is
essential that 21st century educational and vocational offerings be
relevant partnering with universities, trades, governmental, local and
community collaborations that promote economic development, e.g.,
economic clusters, entrepreneurship programs, and businesses.

Therefore, make “The Right Choice” through helping me to
increase student enrollment thereby ensuring community economic
viability.

Background: Special Education Educator (34 years); Perris
Elementary School Board Member (1985-Present): building STEM
magnet, fine arts charter school, Rob Reiner Family Center; assisted
establishing: Riverside County Family Resource Centers (Perris,
Jurupa and Mecca, 2000) and Perris Valley Red Team with UCR

MARY ANN MOTTE	AGE:	63

OCCUPATION:	Incumbent

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

The community college is the lowest cost higher education opportunity
for students, parents and taxpayers. Education levels impact local
employers, economic wealth, and employment opportunity. The
critical issue for MSJC is to increase the college going rate for strong
economic growth.

As trustee, I will continue to be your voice at the board table
representing the student/taxpayerfor policies which increase access,
maximize facilities, improve completion rates, increase full time
faculty and control administrative expense.

As board president, I authored and passed a resolution requiring
MSJC to serve +5% enrollments above state funding resulting in
access for +500 additional full time students and maximized tax
dollars. Currently, I am lobbying for an added metric to the state
funding formula to increase growth apportionment for MSJC.

I worked hard to complete a recent purchase of property in Wildomar
for a future STEM campus for Technology, Science, Engineering
and Mathematics to increase employment and earning potential for
students.

I am a property owner, businesswoman, parent of six college
graduates, attended Colorado State University and support
academics, scholarships and sports at MSJC.

I am not a bureaucrat.

CANDIDATE STATEMENT FOR CITY COUNCIL MEMBER,  CITY OF CANYON LAKE  DAWN HAGGERTY OCCUPATION: Director, C.L. POA EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:  My career as a consultant to major companies, involved finding ways to increase productivity and/or reduce costs.  1 am currently completing my sixth year serving as Director on the Canyon Lake POA. While President, 1 worked with City Representatives and the City Manager in round table discussions regarding mutual concerns.  Past City Councils have seriously neglected addressing financial issues. Now we face a potential heavy tax burden to provide city services. They have not provided us any information regarding the choices we have or the consequences of tax versus declaring bankruptcy.  1 support cityhood, if there’s any reasonable means to sustain it, however, 1 won’t support a burdensome escalating tax, that will continue to rise, so the city can continue its non transparent path with no planning for resolution of the problem.  The vague threats of consequences, if this tax isn’t approved, do not provide any “facts” to voters regarding what will happen to Canyon Lake if the tax isn’t approved. This tax is just another quick fix pot of spending money for a less than frugal council.  We must know what our choices are, to make a good decision. 1 pledge to provide this information to all.	CANDIDATE STATEMENT FOR CITY COUNCIL MEMBER,  CITY OF CANYON LAKE  RANDALL P. BONNER OCCUPATION: Incumbent EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:  1 am proud to have been a member of your Canyon Lake Council, including the Mayor.  Results are the operative word. Integrity is the foundation of absolute transparency.  Established a monthly Roundtable meeting with the POA, Chief of Police, and City Manager. We discuss common goals for operational efficiencies and a coordinated public safety effort.  A new Roundtable was founded with the Chamber of Commerce, Merchant Owners Association, prominent Town Center owners, POA, and City Manager. This group includes a Marketing executive with IBM and a developer of market centers. Our mission is to raise the exposure level of our community. Our citizens and neighboring communities want a positive shopping experience in Canyon Lake.  This City Council is diligently working toward a sound financial future. Our goal is to accomplish this expeditiously.  Experience with the Riverside Conservative Agency for 2 years and now on the Riverside Transit Agency Board of Directors.  Chair of City Finance Committee 3 years and now the Chair of the City Public Safety Committee.  1 am a retired USMCR veteran and from the computer industry.  This City Council needs to find positive solutions. We live in a unique community — A Bit of Paradise.  Let’s preserve what we have!
CANDIDATE STATEMENT FOR CITY COUNCIL MEMBER,  CITY OF CANYON LAKE  JOHN ZAITZ  EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:  Canyon Lake is a great place to live and play, however without strong leadership at the council level, all of this can change.  Since 2008, the reserves have dropped by 70%, twice residents have - appropriately - rejected new taxes, and our fire station - with the paramedics 1 helped ensure - is in danger of closing.  Now the council has decided that a third attempt at taxing city residents is the solution. This tax effort does nothing to ensure the permanent future viability of the city and at best delays the inevitable.  These tactics have jeopardized Canyon Lake’s future. It may be that the municipal status of Canyon Lake changes, but our private gated community will remain intact no matter what and will remain our “little bit of paradise.”  What we need now is a serious, experienced and knowledgeable person to navigate the legal and political challenges and act in the best interests of the residents of Canyon Lake  1 have the necessary experience and knowledge to make sure that no matter what the future holds the residents of Canyon Lake will be safe, secure, and prosperous.  1 would appreciate your vote Zaitz.john@verizon.net	CANDIDATE STATEMENT FOR CITY COUNCIL MEMBER,  CITY OF CANYON LAKE  VICKI WARREN  OCCUPATION: Legal Administrative Professional EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:  Canyon Lake is a small city facing big city problems. Strong leadership, dedication and clear thinking are needed to preserve and defend this city, to help it prosper, and to protect its citizens.  My name is Vicki Warren and 1 bring with me over 14 years of experience working on State and Federal advisory boards and roundtables. 1 know what it takes to get the job done.  This is the first time 1 have been moved to run for an elective office. 1 am not a “professional politician.” 1 am a real person and 1 believe in complete transparency in government.  Protecting Canyon Lake is my goal and 1 gladly give my heart and loyalty to this city and its people. 1 am running for City Council because 1 cannot stand idly by as our resources continue to dwindle and our citizens are left vulnerable.  The time for action is now, before we lose more ground in this fight for our lifestyle, our homes and the future of Canyon Lake.  1 am humbled to have the opportunity to offer my passion, integrity, knowledge and strength in this fight for our little bit of Paradise. Vote for Vicki Warren on November 4th!

HORTON  OCCUPATION: Retired / Canyon Lake City Council Member EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:  Your water district board must be well informed and dedicated to solving the problems of water supply, price, and quality. 1 am well prepared to represent Division 1.  For the past six years, 1 have devoted considerable time to Canyon Lake, Lake Elsinore, and Quail Valley, on compliance, funding, and water agencies. With the continuous drought throughout the state and the threat of water rationing, it is essential to have solid representation on EVMWD fighting for reliable, clean, and affordable water.  1 am Immediate Past President of the LESJWA; Member of the TMDL Task Force; Director for the San Jacinto River Watershed Council; Secretary-Treasurer of the Quail Valley Environmental Coalition; Canyon Lake City Council member; and coordinator of water education events & workshops.

At 22 years old it was a huge challenge to establish myself and my company in a region that 1 had not grown up in. Being in business for the past 12 years, 1 know first hand the kind of red tape one has to navigate to open a business or establish service at an address. Once elected, 1 will be your advocate and your voice.  As your water board director 1 will ensure that:  •	Water and sewer rates remain reasonable and affordable.  •	We will always have access to clean drinking water.  •	Businesses are not driven away due to unreasonable fees and burdensome processes.  Since moving to Lake Elsinore Valley, 1 have been involved in many community organizations including Rotary, Lake Elsinore Public Safety Commission and the Lake Elsinore Valley Chamber of Commerce.

MT. SAN JACINTO COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT
BOND MEASURE ELECTION NOVEMBER 4, 2014

MT. SAN JACINTO COLLEGE AFFORDABLE EDUCATION AND JOB TRAINING MEASURE. “To expand college buildings serving four-year
university transfer, veterans’ education, and career training, by expanding career/support facilities for veterans/military, ensuring buildings are
accessible for the disabled, upgrading nursing, emergency responder, criminal justice, vocational job training classrooms, updating science labs,
electrical systems, technology infrastructure, acquiring, constructing, and repairing classrooms, facilities, sites/equipment, shall Mt. San Jacinto
Community College District issue $295,000,000 in bonds at legal rates with annual financial audits, citizens’ oversight of funds, all funds remaining

Bonds - Yes

Bonds - No

PROJECTS

The Board of Trustees of the Mt. San Jacinto Community College District, to be responsive to the needs of its community, evaluated Mt. San
Jacinto College’s urgent and critical facility needs, and its capacity to provide students, active military and Veterans with support facilities, an
affordable education and prepare them for success in college and careers. Safety issues, enrollmentgrowth, class size reduction and class offerings,
and information and computer technology infrastructure were each considered, in developing the scope of projects to be funded, as outlined in the
District’s Master Facility Plan, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety (the “Master Plan”), and available for review on the District’s website
(www.msi.edu1. In developing the scope of projects, the faculty, staff, students and community have prioritized providing essential job training
and workforce preparation skills students need to succeed in today’s competitive job market, and ensuring buildings are accessible for the
disabled, and facilities available to support an affordable education, so that the most critical needs that will make the Mt. San Jacinto College an
effective place for learning, would be addressed. In the course of developing the Master Plan, public input was received from hundreds of constituents.
It was concluded that if these facility needs were not addressed now, the Mt. San Jacinto College would be unable to remain competitive in preparing
students for jobs in high demand industries and university transfer. The Board concluded that the longer they waited to repair and upgrade Mt. San
Jacinto College, the more expensive it would be. In implementing the Master Plan the Board of Trustees determines that Mt. San Jacinto
College MUST:

(i)	Expand career and SUPPORT FACILITIES FOR VETERANS and military personnel;

(ii)	Increase workforce preparation skills students need to succeed in today’s job market;

(iii)	Ensure BUILDINGS are ACCESSIBLE FOR THE DISABLED;

(iv)	Provide AFFORDABLE, LOW-COST, HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION in San Jacinto, Menifee Valley, San Gorgonio and

Temecula, needed to successfully transfer to four-year universities; and

(v)	Qualify the College for any available State matching funds; and

(vi)	Ensure that the College has the capacity and high quality classrooms and facilities to meet academic needs and

demands of its regional students; and

(vii)	Adhere to stringent FISCAL ACCOUNTABILITY safeguards including:

(a)	REQUIRE ANNUAL FINANCIAL AUDITS,

(b)	Require citizens’ oversight of all funds,

(c)	No funds will be used for administrators’ salaries and pensions,

(d)	ALL FUNDS WILL BE SUBJECT TO LOCAL CONTROL AND WILL REMAIN LOCAL IN MT. SAN JACINTO COLLEGE.

The Master Plan is available for review at the Superintendent/President’s office and at www.msi.edu. The following types of projects are
authorized to be undertaken at Mt. San Jacinto College facilities in Menifee, Temecula, San Jacinto, San Gorgonio, as well as at a to be constructed
technology campus in the Interstate 15 corridor:

Academic Facility and Technology Upgrade Projects to Help Students
and Veterans be Trained for Good Jobs

Goal and Purpose: Because it is extremely hard to get a job in today’s economy, Mt. San Jacinto College must provide the essential
job training and workforce preparation skills students need to succeed in to today’s highly competitive job market. This measure will
expand local education in nursing, science, technology, engineering and math to meet the needs of our local, regional employers and
help attract more high paying jobs and businesses to our region.

33-9008-M5

RV 050-018

Mt. San Jacinto College has served thousands of military veterans, many who have recently returned from war zones and face
challenges including post-traumatic stress disorder and permanent disabilities. The College is a national leader in helping returning
veterans reintegrate with their education and careers, and this measure will upgrade and expand veteran services and job training so
returning service members receive the support they need to complete their education and enter the civilian workforce.

Thus the District requires FUNDS that ARE LOCALLY CONTROLLED to improve academic facilities and technology implementations
which will allow them to continue providing ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE, HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION to local students, active military
and veterans, including:

•	Upgrade and expand facilities for career training in well-paying careers and transfer to universities.

•	Expand course opportunities to increase enrollment, classrooms and instructional facilities in nursing, emergency responder, criminal
justice, vocational job training classrooms, and other core academic classes.

•	Expand facilities for veterans to provide career training and support services to returning veterans seeking training or
retraining to reenter the workforce.

•	Upgrade outdated science, math and computer labs and expand College facilities providing instruction in Science, Technology,
Engineering and Math (STEM).

•	Install additional technology infrastructure to improve computer technology and Internet access.

•	Upgrade outdated job-training classrooms, labs and equipment to provide all students with opportunities to learn job skills.

•	Upgrade support facilities for currently active military personnel.

•	Upgrade and replace existing information technology infrastructure and network systems to improve efficiency and increase capacity.

•	Upgrade and expand telecommunications, Internet and network connections.

•	Upgrade and build academic buildings to expand classrooms for career training in science, medical, public safety and other in-demand
jobs.

•	Upgrade and replace technology, computers, hardware and systems used for job training and retraining programs.

Repair and Construction Projects to
Provide Greater Access to an Affordable Education

Goal and Purpose:	Since the cost of attending a public university has risen to as much as six (6) times that of attending Mt. San

Jacinto College, students rely on Mt. San Jacinto to save as much as $35,000 in tuition on their way to a four-year degree. Therefore,
keeping Mt. San Jacinto’s facilities upgraded will best serve all local students, military and veterans who can earn college credits,
certificates and job skills at a reasonable price:

♦	ENSURE BUILDINGS ARE ACCESSIBLE FOR THE DISABLED.

♦	Upgrade aging roofs, bathrooms and disabled accessibility, repair floors, walkways, lighting and electrical systems.

♦	Construct more classroom space.

♦	Remove asbestos.

♦	Upgrade campus facilities to provide improved access, including road and parking upgrades to improve safety, access and traffic flow.

♦	Improve heating, ventilation, insulation, doors, lighting, and windows to increase energy efficiency and save money.

♦	Upgrade outdated electrical systems and wiring for computer technology and Internet access.

♦	Renovate, repair or replace outdated laboratories, classrooms, training centers and support facilities.

♦	Upgrade and replace classroom instructional equipment.

♦	Improve student safety, emergency preparedness, and security systems, including lighting, fencing, smoke detectors, fire alarms and
sprinklers, gas and sewer lines.

absence of State matching funds, which the District will aggressively pursue to reduce the District’s share of the costs of the projects, the District
will not be able to complete some of the projects listed above. Some projects, such as physical education facilities, may be undertaken as joint use
projects in cooperation with other local public or non-profit agencies. The budget for each project is an estimate and may be affected by factors
beyond the District’s control. The final cost of each project will be determined as plans and construction documents are finalized, construction
bids are received, construction contracts are awarded and projects are completed. Based on the final costs of each project, certain of the projects
described above may be delayed or may not be completed. Demolition of existing facilities and reconstruction of facilities scheduled for repair and
upgrade may occur, if the Board determines that such an approach would be more cost-effective in creating more enhanced and operationally
efficient campuses. Necessary site preparation/restoration may occur in connection with new construction, renovation or remodeling, or installation
or removal of relocatable classrooms, including ingress and egress, removing, replacing, or installing irrigation, utility lines, trees and landscaping,
relocating fire access roads, and acquiring any necessary easements, licenses, or rights of way to the property. Proceeds of the bonds may be
used to pay or reimburse the District for the cost of District staff when performing work on or necessary and incidental to bond projects. Bond
proceeds shall only be expended for the specific purposes identified herein. The District shall create an account into which proceeds of the bonds
shall be deposited and comply with the reporting requirements of Government Code § 53410.

MEASURE “AA” - MT. SAN JACINTO COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT

Mt. San Jacinto Community College District
2014 Bond Election
Tax Rate Statement

An election will be held in the Mt. San Jacinto Community District (the “District”) on November 4,2014, to authorize the sale of up to $295,000,000
in bonds of the District to finance facilities as described in the proposition. If the bonds are approved, the District expects to issue the Bonds in
multiple series over time. Principal and interest on the bonds will be payable from the proceeds of tax levies made upon the taxable property in the
District. The following information is provided in compliance with Sections 9400 through 9404 of the California Elections Code.

1.	The best estimate of the tax which would be required to be levied to fund this bond issue during the first fiscal year after the sale of the first series
of bonds, based on estimated assessed valuations available at the time of filing of this statement, is $0.01320 per $100 ($13.20 per $100,000) of
assessed valuation in fiscal year 2015-16.

2.	The best estimate of the tax rate which would be required to be levied to fund this bond issue during the first fiscal year after the sale of the
last series of bonds, based on estimated assessed valuations available at the time of filing of this statement, is $0.01320 per $100 ($13.20 per
$100,000) of assessed valuation in fiscal year 2024-25.

3.	The best estimate of the highest tax rate which would be required to be levied to fund this bond issue, based on estimated assessed valuations
available at the time of filing of this statement, is $0.01320 per $100 ($13.20 per $100,000) of assessed valuation, which is projected to be the same
in every fiscal year that the bonds remain outstanding.

Voters should note that estimated tax rates are based on the ASSESSED VALUE of taxable property on the County’s official tax rolls, not on the
property’s market value, which could be more or less than the assessed value. In addition, taxpayers eligible for a property tax exemption, such as
the homeowner's exemption, will be taxed at a lower effective tax rate than described above. Certain taxpayers may also be eligible to postpone
payment of taxes. Property owners should consult their own property tax bills and tax advisors to determine their property's assessed value and
any applicable tax exemptions.

Attention of all voters is directed to the fact that the foregoing information is based upon the District’s projections and estimates only, which are not
binding upon the District. The actual tax rates and the years in which they will apply may vary from those presently estimated, due to variations
from these estimates in the timing of bond sales, the amount of bonds sold and market interest rates at the time of each sale, and actual assessed
valuations over the term of repayment of the bonds. The dates of sale and the amount of bonds sold at any given time will be determined by the
District based on need for construction funds and other factors. The actual interest rates at which the bonds will be sold will depend on the bond
market at the time of each sale. Actual future assessed valuation will depend upon the amount and value of taxable property within the District as
determined by the County Assessor in the annual assessment and the equalization process.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE “AA”

In the last four years, the state has cut millions of dollars from Mt. San
Jacinto Community College. We won’t stand for this, and can’t rely on
Sacramento politicians to help our local colleges—vote YES on “AA”!

Do you think it’s difficult to get a job in today’s slowly recovering
economy? We sure do! Vote YES on “AA” to expand essential
job training and workforce preparation skills in nursing, science,
technology, engineering and math to meet the needs of our local,
regional employers. A skilled workforce helps attract more high paying
jobs and businesses to our region.

YES on “AA” ensures that our tax dollars stay local to address our
area’s educational and job training needs. Sacramento is legally
prohibited from taking Measure “AA” funds!

YES on “AA” helps provide job training and education for our returning
military veterans. It is shameful how the federal government is treating
our war veterans. Mt. San Jacinto College is a national leader in helping
returning veterans reintegrate with their education and careers. It
upgrades and expands veteran services and job training so returning
veterans receive the support they need to complete their education and
enter the civilian workforce.

YES on “AA” will:

•	Improve our nationally-recognized, award-winning education
by expanding our transfer preparation and career training
opportunities/increasing partnerships with area employers to
fill local job training needs

•	Benefit students from EVERY region in the District

•	Double the college's student capacity

•	Upgrade leaky roofs and bathrooms

•	Upgrade outdated nursing labs, paramedic, 9-1-1, law enforcement
and job training classrooms

•	Ensure disabled accessibility

YES on “AA”'s strict Fiscal Accountability requirements include an
expanded Independent Citizens’ Oversight Committee and annual
financial audits ensuring money is spent as promised. No money will go
towards salaries or pensions and ALL money will stay local to address
our region’s education and job training needs.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE “AA”

While StateFunding was curtailed following the “Great Recession,”
Bond Proponents Falsely Argue that MSJC received only cuts during
the past 4 years. Rather, the 2014-15 State Budget increases Funding
by almost $1 Billion, or about 11 Percent over the previous year. “I’m
calling it a Grand Slam,” said Scott Lay, President of the Community
College League of California, a Nonprofit Association for Community
College Districts Statewide. “It freezes tuition and brings us back to the
Funding Levels of 2007-2008.” Budget Increases Include:

•	$155.2	Million	to fund a 3 percent restoration of access allowing

Colleges to add approximately 70,000 students.

•	$48.5	Million	to	fund a Cost of Living Adjustment of 0.86 percent.

•	$175	Million	for deferred maintenance and instructional

equipment.

•	$235.6 Million reduction in payment deferrals, combined with
$356.8 million proposed in one-time funds for this purpose.

•	$39	Million	in	Proposition 39 funds for energy efficiency and

workforce development projects.

•	$2.5	Million	for local technical assistance supporting

implementation of effective student success practices, with
priority placed on underperforming districts.

•	$1.1	Million	and nine new Chancellor’s Office positions to

develop student success indicators and monitor College/District
performance.

•	$50	Million	in	one-time	funding for incentive awards recognizing

models of innovation in Higher Education.

•	NO student fee increase for the 2014-15 Academic Year.

State Funding is Rebounding to Pre-Recession Levels. It’s the WRONG
time to Burden Locals with More Debt and Higher Taxes. Please Vote
NO on Measure “AA”

A vote in favor of this Controversial Bond Measure means Higher
Taxes. Measure “AA” means that WE Assume the Obligation to
Repay $Millions of Dollars in Debt issued on behalf of Mt. San Jacinto
Community College - in addition to Interest and Debt Servicing - which
makes Payback on Bonds as high as VA to 2 times the Original Debt.
So although MSJC will have roughly $300 $Million to Spend, the Money
WE are Obligated to Repay could reach nearly $600 $Million - which
Bottom Line remains Unknown because MSJC Neglects to Disclose
specifics of this ‘Minor’ detail. Bond issuers and Wall Street types are
Salivating over Stuffing their pockets full of Your Cash.

Measure “AA” also means OUR Homes become Collateral for
Repayment of these Bonds. Bond Holders gain a legal Right to
Foreclose and Auction off OUR Homes to Secure Debt Payments
in event of Default. So if You become short on Funds and choose
“Extravagances” such as food, clothing, health care, rent, car payments
or gasoline over Repaying MSJC’s Bond, You will risk Foreclosure

Measure “AA” is swirling in Controversy even before ink dries on the
ballots. The MSJC Board of Trustees could Not even reach a consensus
on their Decision to load You Down with more Debt. The vote was 4-1,
with Trustee Eugene Kadow voting NO on Bonds.

MSJC is among the Lowest performing Junior Colleges Statewide.

Measure "DD” was placed on the ballot by the City Council by action at
its August 6, 2014 meeting. If approved by majority vote of the voters
voting on the measure, Measure “DD” would approve an ordinance
adopting a Utility User Tax (“UUT”). Based upon an analysis from an
independent financial adviser, the revenues from the UUT would have
been sufficient to eliminate the City budget shortfall identified in the
2013-14 fiscal year.

A UUT is a tax on utility services used by City residents within the
City. The ordinance broadly defines received “utility services” as
those for electricity, natural gas, water and sewer, telephone and solid
waste/refuse collection. The ordinance presumes that billings received
by Canyon Lake residents are for such services used within the City.
The ordinance provides details regarding the levy and collection of
the tax; however, state and federal laws will supersede the ordinance
provisions. For example, certain internet services and solar electrical
energy generated only for personal use are exempt from taxation
pursuant to the provisions of state law and the proposed ordinance.
Propane tanks purchased for use within the City are exempted from tax
by the ordinance. There is an appeal process to dispute the imposition
or amount of the tax.

The tax rate proposed is 3.95% with no increase allowed. The tax would
be levied on the amount of each separate utility bill, so the amount
of tax would vary with the cost of the utility services provided for that
billing period. The tax would be collected by each utility provider and
paid to the City. There are penalties for non-collection as well as for
non-payment. The ordinance requires an annual, independent audit of
the collection and use of funds.

If approved, the collection of the tax will begin as soon as possible after
such approval, but no later than January 1,2015. The tax will terminate
by its terms on December 31, 2020.

If Measure “DD” is not approved by a majority vote of the voters voting
on the Measure, then the UUT will not be approved and will not go into
effect.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure “DD”. If
you desire a copy of the measure, and the ordinance, please call the
election official’s office at (951) 246-2024 and a copy will be provided
to you at no cost to you.

Vote YES on “DP”-SAVE OUR CITY, MAINTAIN LOCAL CONTROL!

YES on “DD” maintains Canyon Lake as an independent, self-
governing City to protect our interests from County bureaucrats,
developers and politicians.

YES on “DD” maintains our local control and authority over land use
issues.

YES on “DD” maintains funding for rapid 9-1-1 emergency response
times that save lives and property.

YES on “DD” maintains funding for local needs, like keeping Railroad
Canyon Road in good condition.

Without more money, Canyon Lake won’t survive beyond the next
several years. The City of Canyon Lake provides police and fire
protection at the level needed for our residents, many of whom are
seniors-YES on “DD”!

Currently, Canyon Lake paramedics and firefighters respond to your
9-1-1 calls within 3-4 minutes. Without funding from “DD”, it would be
up to County officials to determine the level of these services, not your
local elected City Council accountable to you. Closure of the City’s
only local Fire Station would extend response times to 8-10 minutes, or
longer, outside of the 5 minute safety parameter cited by the American
Medical Association—YES on “DD”!

Other services - ensuring Lake quality, conducting code enforcement
and maintaining control overourown land use decisions—also preserve
the quality of life we all value so highly. YES on “DD” ensures Canyon
Lake has the financial resources to continue providing these services.

YES on “DD” is Fiscally Accountable, requiring independent annual
audits, NO tax increase without voter approval, and expiration in six
years.

We incorporated in the early 1990’s to ensure Local Control over our
own destiny and services. YES on “DD” preserves our local authority
so we aren’t subject to the whims of County politicians who don't live in
our City. Vote YES on “DD” for the future of Canyon Lake!

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE “DD”

Canyon Lake City Council tried twice to convince you to vote for a tax
to fund the fire station, each time the tax measured failed because it
did not receive the required 2/3 majority to pass. So they call this tax a
utility tax for the City General fund (not the Fire Station) so it can pass
with 50% +1 vote.

The City published their budget and all expenses are accounted for,
except one. That one is Fire, which is $750,000 short. The proponents
claim (no independent certification) this tax will raise $775,000 annually.
Amazing that amount is the same that’s needed to fund the Fire Station.
But if they told you the truth then passing vote would be 2/3 and they
know you will not, and have not, passed a tax like that.

The council has refused to discuss any alternatives to the tax. The City
Council refuses to provide financial projections, the council cannot
insure that this tax will even take care of the immediate problems, much
less the annual increases in services.

If this tax passes you will pay more for your utility bills every month,
forever. But you will also pay higher POA dues because the POA will
have to pay more for their water and electricity costs which then - is
passed on to us.

The alternative to taxing is leadership and planning. Taxing the citizens
doesn’t take thought, planning, discussion, or action.

Don’t double tax yourselves. Vote NO on Measure “DD”

The Canyon Lake City Council is at it again. They have decided that
asking residents twice to tax themselves and residents responding with
a resounding “No” twice is not enough. Now, they want to try it for a third
time. The first two times they needed it to keep fire station 60 open, but
the station is still open.

This time they cannot even guarantee the station will remain open if the
tax passes. This time they are trying an end run around the two-thirds
approval requirement of past efforts and trying to impose a utility tax,
the proceeds of which will go directly into the city’s general account
where the council can do anything it pleases with the funds. They are
telling us now they need it for Railroad Canyon Road, a road that was
just upgraded.

The City Council does not have any financial projections to determine
if the tax would make a difference for the long term financial stability of
Canyon Lake, who would administer it, where the money would actually
end up, exactly how it would be collected, etc. The Council and City
Staff have failed to do their jobs and are asking you to decide what to
do without even providing crucial information.

If Canyon Lake is to remain a city, we need a long-term solution to our
chronic financial problems, not another short-term tax band aid. And

if we do not remain a city, we should remember that nothing will change
our gated community. We will still have our “bit of paradise.” We can
have the same response time for emergencies even under another city.
We can get everything we have today without a Utility Tax. A NO vote
gives us what we have today - we won’t lose anything.

Vote No on “DD”

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE “DD”

Our opponent thinks it’s a myth that an independent, locally controlled
Canyon Lake isn’t in jeopardy. The fact is, YES on “DD” is the best
choice to keeping Canyon Lake a self-governing City!

FACT: YES on “DD” ensures local funding and control over OUR City
services and decision-making. Would a County bureaucrat know what’s
best for us? NO! Vote YES on “DD”!

FACT: YES on “DD” maintains critical funding to preserve rapid
emergency 9-1-1 response times that save lives and property. Without
Measure DD, emergency fire and paramedic response times would
increase to 11-14 minutes - outside of the safety parameters cited by
the American Medical Association.

FACT: By law, YES on “DD” requires strong transparency and fiscal
accountability protections - including annual independent audits, NO
future tax increase without voter approval, and expiration in six years.
Measure “DD” proceeds will be spent responsibly and as promised!

FACT: YES on “DD” preserves local decision-making power on policy
issues, including land use, Lake quality and essential public safety
services we all use. Measure “DD” maintains Railroad Canyon Road
and other City services - and won’t be subject to the whims of out-of-
town County bureaucrats.

YES on “DD” preserves Canyon Lake as an independent city with
rapid 9-1-1 emergency response services, local control over land use,
and fiscal accountability to local residents.

Join Canyon Lake City Council members, property owners, longtime
residents and longtime community members -vote YES on “DD”! We
all agree - vote YES on “DD” for the future of Canyon Lake.
