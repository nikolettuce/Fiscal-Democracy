iivir-AH liAL ANALYSIS BY Oi l Y ATTORNEY
MEASURE A ■ * '

This measure asks the voters to decide whether an ordinance to be finally adopted by the Val-
lejo City Council on August 11, 1992, to impose a special tax on all parcels of real property
located within the City limits for the exclusive purpose of maintaining and expanding police pro-
tection services shall be enacted and made operative commencing with the next fiscal year (i.e.
July 1,1993).

The ordinance establishes a tax rate of $50 per year for each residential parcel unit, and a tax
rate of from $50 to $175 per year for each commercial and industrial business unit based upon
their gross receipts. The residential tax will be collected on the property tax bills, and the com-
mercial/industrial tax will be collected with the business license fees. Vacant land is charged 50%
of the residential rate, and federal, state and local governmental agencies, as well as home occu-
pations, are exempt.

The objective of the ordinance is to raise up to $2.5 million per year to maintain and expand
police protection services in the City of Vallejo as determined by the City’s assessment of Its law
enforcement priorities. The City Council must commit 46% of the City's general fund to police
services in order to levy this tax, and if that isn’t done, then the tax cannot be levied for that
particular year. The $2.5 million figure as well as the tax rate itself will be adjusted each year for
inflation by applying the appropriate CPI indices.

The City Council is given the power to suspend all or a portion of the tax If it determines that
police protection services are being adequately met from other revenues, and the Council can
make certain amendments to the ordinance, but cannot raise the tax without voter approval.

The City Council each’ year is required to appoint a citizen's task force to review the ordinance
and the use of the tax revenues, and to make recommendations on whether the tax should be
continued and the best use of the funds in the next fiscal year. The ordinance also adjusts the
City's debt limit by the amount of the revenue derived from the tax In order to satisfy the man-
date of the State Constitution....	. .

State law (Calif. Govt. Code, §§53970-53979, inclusive) allows a city, by ordinance, to impose a
special tax for police and/or fire protection services provided the tax is approved by two-thirds of the
voters voting on the measure at a regular or special municipal election.

DATED: August 6, 1992

s/ John M. Powers, City Attorney
City of Vallejo

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure A. If you desire a copy
of the measure, please call the City Clerk’s Office at 707/648-4527 and a copy
will be mailed at no cost to you.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE A

We all pay for crime. It costs us in increased insurance rates, higher overhead in local business
which is passed on to the consumer, and home security systems. The price of personal
losses and fear cannot be calculated. In the current climate of increasing demands for police
services and dwindling resources to fund them, the citizens of Vallejo have the opportunity to
gain control of their community.

Voting yes on the police assessment will provide additional money that can only be used for
police services. It will fund more officers, buy much needed equipment, and improve the commu-
nication system. All this means the officers will have more time on the street fighting crime and
making Vallejo safer.

Voting yes on the police assessment means voting yes on community-based substations. The
two stations in North and Central Vallejo have been dramatically effective in reducing crime and
improving the quality of life in these areas. We need these neighborhood stations in all areas of
the City. .	.

Voting yes on the police assessment is a vote for the well being of our children, our elderly, our
families. Fifty dollars a year is a small price to pay for peace of mind. This amount cannot be
levied by City Council action - only two-thirds of the voters can make it happen.

Voting yes on the police assessment is a vote for the future of Vallejo. This increased revenue
for police services will give our officers the tools and time to make our City the safe community
we all desire and deserve.
