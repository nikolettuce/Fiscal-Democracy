WHAT'S NEW THIS ELECTION

This election offers a myriad of changes for our voters both due to legislative actions
and county processes.

POLLING PLACE ROOM CHANGE

Consolidated Precinct 326
Central Coast Baptist Church
153 S. 9th St
Fellowship Hall
Grover Beach, CA 93430

Due to the damage caused to the building used on Election Day at the Central Coast
Baptist Church, the polling place has been relocated to their Fellowship Hall in the
Church’s main building at the corner of 9th St. and Rockaway Avenue. Voters will find
signage directing them to the alternate poll location on Election Day.

NEW POLLING PLACES- VOTERS NEED TO CHECK POLLING PLACE LOCATION
BEFORE HEADING OUT ON ELECTION DAY- In San Luis Obispo County, we rely on
public buildings for polling places. However, the demand for these buildings is great
and although our local agencies, schools and churches are also cooperative in ensuring
we have sufficient space for Election Day activities, some polling places may change
from previous locations due to scheduling conflicts. As always, it is important that
voters check to make sure they know the polling place to which they are assigned.

THE CALIFORNIA TOP-TWO OPEN PRIMARY SYSTEM

For all voter nominated offices (U.S. Senate, U.S. Congress, State Senate and State
Assembly) only the two candidates who received the highest and second highest
number of votes in the Primary Election will be on the ballot for the General Election. In
addition, write-in candidates are not allowed for these contests so there are no write-in
lines presented to the voters. The rules for Non-Partisan (County, Cities, Schools and
other local jurisdictions) offices did not change.

SAME PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE NOMINEE FOR TWO POLITICAL PARTIES

Both the state Republican and American Independent political parties in California have
declared Donald J. Trump and Michael R. Pence for President and Vice President. As
a result, per Elections Codes 13105(c) and guidance from the Secretary of State’s
office, both political parties will be listed next to the candidates’ names: Republican,
American Independent. However, according to Elections Code 13210(b), this contest is
required to state “Vote for One Party.”

SAMPLE BALLOT/SUPPLEMENTAL VOTER INFORMATION PAMPHLET

All voters registered by October 10th (29 days before the Election) will receive a “digest-
sized” Sample Ballot in the mail (or a Vote By Mail Voter Information Guide if being sent
a ballot in the mail). Voters will also receive a full-sized Supplemental Voter Information
Pamphlet containing the information related to Measure J-16, the San Luis Obispo
County Self-Help Local Transportation Investment Plan measure. The thirty pages
containing the full text of the measure, the measure’s investment plan, impartial
analysis, and arguments/rebuttals in favor and against the measure could not fit in the
sample ballot and vote by mail voter information pamphlet, so a separate mailing
containing Measure J-16 information is beigg sent to all voters. All of these pamphlet

information is also available on the Clerk-Recorder’s website: www.slovote.com

VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS

REQUEST VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT BY PHONE: State legislation now allows a voter
to request a vote by mail ballot by calling the elections office. Each voter must request
their own ballot and the elections staff will confirm pertinent information before the
request can be filled. This change will make it easier for voters to request a ballot,
particularly when the deadline for requesting a ballot is looming.

EXTENSION OF DEADLINE FOR VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS

New legislations allows county election officials to count vote by mail ballots that are
postmarked by Election Day and received within three business days after Election Day.
As a result of this new legislation, counties are allowed to open and process vote by
mail ballots as early as ten business days before the election instead of the seven days
allowed earlier. Also, counties are allowed up to thirty days to complete the canvass of
the vote.

EXPANDED OPTION FOR MILITARY AND OVERSEAS VOTERS

It has long been a challenge to get vote by mail ballots to citizens living overseas and
military voters, particularly those serving in areas with limited mail delivery. By law,
ballots can be provided these voters 60 days before an election, but even with the extra
time to mail the ballot, voters can be disenfranchised. To help alleviate this situation and
efficiently get ballots to those serving our country, San Luis Obispo County has
partnered with Democracy Live on Live Ballot, a program which allows these voters to
securely access their ballot and sample ballot information online. Once a voter notifies
us that they wish to participate in Live Ballot, they receive an email notification that the
information is available. They can then sign in, access the information specific to their
ballot, print and mark the ballot and return it via mail (at no cost to the voter) or if
circumstances permit, return it via fax.

WEBSITE CHANGES AND NEW FEATURES

ON-LINE VOTER REGISTRATION

Thanks to a collaborative effort between county registrars, the Secretary of State and
Department of Motor Vehicles, voters can now register to vote on-line. The voter enters
his or her information in the secure system and, if a match is found with the DMV
database, the voter’s information and signature will be forwarded to the appropriate
county elections office. If there is no match found, the voter will be prompted to print the
registration form, sign it and return it to their local elections office. This new system
makes voter registration convenient and accessible to voters, especially as registration
deadlines approach. Registering online has the double benefit of being convenient for
the voter, but beneficial to the elections office since the data keyed in by the registrant
populates the county’s database, thereby reducing the manual data entry associated
with forms and the inherent errors caused by illegible information and computer entry
mistakes. Check it out at www.SLOvote.com and click on Register to Vote.

PLACEMENT ON THE BALLOT/ROTATION OF CANDIDATES

The order in which candidates' names appear on the ballot is determined by a random
drawing of the 26 letters of the alphabet. This random drawing is conducted by the
Secretary of State and the County Clerk-Recorder prior to each election. The random
drawing for this election was held on August 18, 2016.

Election law also requires the names of candidates for some offices to change
positions, such as federal, statewide and county wide offices (i.e. Governor, United
States Senator, Secretary of State, United States Representative). The purpose of the
rotation is so one candidate's name does not always appear first, or last, on all of the
ballots for the races.

As required by state law, names of candidates for certain offices are rotated on the
ballot as follows:

OFFICE	ROTATION
Statewide Offices, United States Representative, Board of Equalization member	Candidates' names are arranged in accordance with the alphabetical drawing beginning with the lowest numbered Assembly District in the State or Congressional or Board of Equalization District. Thereafter, for each succeeding Assembly District, the candidate's name appearing first is placed last; the order of the other names remains unchanged. Since San Luis Obispo County is represented by only one Assembly District, these candidates will be in the same order on every ballot in this county.
State Senate and State Assembly	For multi-county districts, such as the senate and assembly each county conducts a random drawing and the candidates' names are arranged in accordance with each county's alphabetical drawing- no other rotation.
County Supervisor, Cities	No rotation

VOTE - BY- MAIL BALLOT INFORMATION

History: Absentee ballots were first made available by the North for the soldiers and
sailors in the Civil War. California first allowed absentee voting in 1920 for those who
were ill or disabled, lived too far from the polls and other special circumstances. In
1978 legislation was passed which allowed universal absentee voting. As a result of
this change allowing any person to vote absentee (now vote-by-mail), it has become a
very popular means to cast a ballot. See the chart on page 8 to track the trend of voters
casting their ballots by mail. In 2002, permanent absentee voting was expanded to any
voter upon request. There are currently over 105,700 permanent vote-by-mail voters in

ii

San Luis Obispo County totaling more than 66.6% of the total registered voters.

How To Apply for a Vote-by-Mail Ballot:

The first day this office can issue a vote-by-mail ballot for the General Election is
October 11, 2016, (29 days before the election). Vote-by-mail ballot requests must be
received no later than November 1st in order for the ballot to be mailed to the voter.
After that date, the voter must appear in the office of the County Clerk-Recorder and
complete an application indicating the reason they cannot appear at the polls on
Election Day. Vote-by-mail ballots may be requested in one of four ways:

□	By calling the County Clerk-Recorder’s office and requesting a Vote By Mail
ballot at 805-781-5228.

□	By filling out and mailing the Vote by Mail Application on the back cover of the
sample ballot booklet. Sample ballot booklets were mailed September 29th.

□	By letter to the County Clerk-Recorder, 1055 Monterey St., D120 San Luis
Obispo CA 93408. The letter must state the voter’s name, residence address,
address to which the ballot should be sent and voter's signature.

□	In person at the County Clerk-Recorder's Office- in San Luis Obispo at the
address above or at our office in Atascadero- 5955 Capistrano Ave., Suite B.
The office hours in Atascadero are 7:30-4:00.

□	By faxing a written request to the County Clerk-Recorder's Office at 805-781-
1111.

To be counted, the voted ballot must be returned by the voter personally at any polling
place in the county no later than 8:00 p.m. or if mailed, postmarked no later than
Election Day and received by the Elections office within three business days of Election
Day. Nevertheless, it is recommended that voters mail ballots a week prior to the
election to ensure that the ballot will be received in time. The voter may also authorize
a designated family member to return the voted ballot to any polling place in the county
or to the County Clerk-Recorder's Office.

WEEKEND VOTING

The County Clerk-Recorder's Office will be open on the Saturday and Sunday before
the election from 9:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. to issue vote-by-mail ballots. Voters may vote
the ballot at the office in the voting booths or have a family member return the ballot for
them by 8:00 p.m. on Election Day.

PREPARING FOR THE ELECTION

THE READER’S DIGEST VERSION
E-120 TO ELECTION DAY

The staff of the County Clerk-Recorder’s Office begins preparation for a county wide
election at least six months prior to Election Day and after that every day is counted as
E-the number of days left. You could ask any employee in our office (and probably any
candidate) how many days until the election and we won’t even have to think twice to
answer. Some of the important dates and the activities surrounding them are:

E minus number	Date	Activity
E-126	July 5	Letters sent to polling places
E-113	July 18	Opening of the nomination period.
E-110	July 21	Initial letters sent to potential precinct workers for commitments to work on election day.
E-88	August 12	Close of the nomination period. After the close of nomination, the ballot layout and preparation begins. Proofing of the sample ballots and ballot information continues through September. The Vote-by-Mail ballots are received by mid-October and the sample ballot mailing is completed around the same time.
E-70	August 30	Assignment letters to precinct workers that have been assigned to polling places.
E-60	September 9	60 day close. This is the initial target date for ensuring that the voter rolls are as updated as possible. Any voter registration received in our office by that date is processed into the system and all changes are accomplished before officially closing our files. The 60 day close file is sent to the Secretary of State and to the printer who prepares and mails San Luis Obispo County sample ballots. These names constitute the first mailing of state ballot pamphlets and County sample ballot pamphlets. Any changes or anyone who registers between this date and the 29 day close of registration (October 10) will be mailed the voter information in the second mailing, scheduled for mailing the week of October 24.
E-57 to E-14	September 12 - October 25	Write-in candidate nomination period.
E-40	September 29	Sample Ballot booklets are mailed to voters who have not signed up to be a permanent vote-by-mail voter or do not live in a mail ballot precinct.
E-43 to E-20	September 26 -October 19	Testing of voting machines and ballot counting software. Certification to transmit election night results sent to the Secretary of

T3~

Vote-by-mail ballots are mailed to the 105,700 voters who are signed up a permanent VBM voters and to those who live in mail ballot precincts. During the week of the close of registration, staff is busy processing voter registrations. These must be completed by the end of the week so new voters can be sent their sample ballot booklets and state voter information guides in a timely manner. While this is going on the voting booths and precinct supplies are being prepared for delivery to the county’s 137 precincts and last minute changes to precinct worker assignments are made. During the month of October, staff is conducting 8 training sessions for the 700+ volunteers working at the polls.
E-15	October 24	Official close of registration. Anyone registered between October 11th and 24th is eligible to vote however, the voter will not receive the state voter information guide or the County sample ballot booklet. The voter will only receive a postcard indicating their polling place location and where they can obtain voter information.
E-14	October 25	Elections staff begins opening and preparing the vote-by-mail ballots for counting.
E-12	October 27	Elections staff begins counting the vote-by- mail ballots. No results are released until after the close of polls on Election Night.

ELECTION NIGHT PROCEDURES

After the last voter in line at 8:00 has cast their ballot, the precinct workers pack up and
return precinct materials and the voted ballots in sealed containers to either the regional
collection centers or directly to the Elections office in San Luis Obispo. Elections staff
verifies that all ballots and required materials have been received and that security
measures have been followed prior to releasing the precinct workers. All ballots and
materials are brought to the Government Center in San Luis Obispo for ballot counting
and secure storage.

SPEED OF BALLOT COUNTING ELECTION NIGHT

As in the past, results of early vote-by-mail ballots (those received by Saturday,
November 5th) will be available immediately after 8:00 pm. The ballots will be counted
centrally in the County Clerk-Recorder’s office on Election Night instead of at the polls
during the day. The ballots will be transported from our regional collection centers in
Paso Robles, Atascadero, Morro Bay and Arroyo Grande to the Government Center
and fed through the Accuvote scanners by county staff. Final election night results
should be available by 12:30 a.m.

INCOMPLETE BALLOT COUNTING ELECTION NIGHT

The public is often surprised on the day after a major election when they learn that there
are as many as 15,000 ballots county wide remaining to be counted after the election.
There are three categories of ballots which cannot be processed on Election Night:

1.	VOTE-BY-MAIL BALLOTS TURNED IN ELECTION DAY- Many vote-by-mail
voters wait until Election Day to make their voting choices and then drop off their
ballots at a polling place. These ballots are received after the polls close on
election night. All vote-by-mail ballots must be pre-processed before they are
counted- including entering that the ballot has been returned to protect against
double voting and verifying the voter's signature on every envelope against the
signature on file in our office.

2.	PROVISIONAL BALLOTS- Provisional Ballots are voted at the polls when the
precinct workers cannot determine the voter's eligibility to vote in that election.
Provisional ballots are sealed in special envelopes and must be individually
researched and verified at the County Clerk-Recorder's Office before the ballots
is counted or rejected in accordance with election laws. There are several
reasons why someone would be required to vote a provisional ballot at the
polling location:

15

□	Voter is listed as having received a vote-by-mail ballot but does not have
the ballot to surrender at the polls.

□	Voter is voting under the fail safe provisions of the National Voting Rights
Act. A fail safe voter is a registered voter in this county, who has moved
and did not re-register to vote or notify the elections office of his/her
change of address.

□	Voter insists on voting a ballot for a party other than the party indicated in
the roster.

□	Voter's name is not on the roster, but the voter insists they are eligible to
vote in that precinct.

□	Voter is required to show identification as a first time voter under the Help
America Vote Act and cannot produce the required identification.

In each of these instances, the elections staff must verify that the voter is eligible
to vote the ballot they were issued and verify the voter’s signature prior to
opening the ballot for processing.

3.	DAMAGED BALLOTS: Election Day ballots that are unable to be processed by
the ballot scanners because of stray marks, overvotes or tears and need to be
duplicated prior to counting.

The majority of the vote-by-mail ballots are counted by the Friday after the election.
Some of these ballots require additional processing and their count is completed in the
week following the election. Furthermore, the ballots postmarked by Election Day and
received within the three days following the election will be processed during the
following week as well. The provisional and damaged ballots are normally counted just
prior to certification of the results. Results are released as a count is completed and a
schedule of counting dates and times will be posted on the County Clerk-Recorder
website after the election.

WRAPPING UP THE ELECTION
WHAT IS THE OFFICIAL CANVASS?

The election canvass process is an internal audit required by state law to ensure the
accuracy of election results. California election law allows 30 days to conduct the
official canvass of final election results. The official canvass begins on Thursday,
November 10th and must be concluded within 30 days, no later than December 8th.
The County Clerk-Recorder strives to complete the official canvass before the allotted
30 day period. All aspects of the canvass are open to the public. The canvass
concludes with the certification and issuance of official election results. Listed below
are the major components of the official canvass.

Completion of count for vote-by-mail and provisional ballots- as described above.

Election Materials accounted for- Staff verifies that all elections materials have been
returned and accounted for and that precinct workers have correctly followed Election
Day procedures.

Roster Reconciliation- Following the close of the polls on Election Day, precinct
officers are responsible for completing the Official Ballot Statement shown below.

OFFICIAL BALLOT STATEMENT				
1.	TOTAL BALLOTS RECEIVED	1. 400		
2.	NUMBER OF SPOILED BALLOTS		2.	2
3.	NUMBER OF UNUSED BALLOTS		3.	294
4.	NUMBER OF PROVISIONAL BALLOTS		4.	10
5.  AV	NUMBER OF VOTED BALLOTS (do not include and Provisional Ballots)		5.	94
6.	TOTAL OF 2,3,4 &5 ( MUST AGREE WITH #1)	6. 400		
7. TOTAL SIGNATURES ON ROSTER (MUST AGREE WITH #5			7.	94

As part of the official canvass, the signatures in each roster are re-counted and the
number of signatures indicated by the inspector on the roster is compared to the
number of ballots tabulated by the computer tally system. Any discrepancies are
investigated. The balancing process normally takes 10 days to complete.

Manual Vote Tally- All voted ballots from at least 2 precincts (1% of the 137 precincts)
are manually tallied for every contests and balanced against the computer counts to
verify the accuracy of the election tally system. For any contest which is not on the
ballot in one of those two precincts, an additional precinct’s ballots are counted for that
contest only. In addition, this same procedure is completed for 1% of the vote-by-mail
ballots. The completion of the manual tally usually takes 2-4 days, depending on the
number of contests on the ballot and the voter turnout.

Apply Voting History- All voters who voted at the polls are given credit for voting.

Account for all ballots- The number of precinct and vote-by-mail ballots printed,
issued and unused are accounted for and balanced. Discrepancies are investigated.

Certify Election and report to the Secretary of State - Registrar of Voters certifies the
Election and sends the certification, statement of vote and supplemental statement of
vote to the Secretary of State. A Board item is then presented to the Board of
Supervisors.

SCHOOL BONDS. FUNDING FOR K-12 SCHOOL AND
COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACILITIES. INITIATIVE
STATUTE. Authorizes $9 billion in general obligation
bonds for new construction and modernization of K-12
public school facilities; charter schools and vocational
education facilities; and California Community Colleges
facilities. Fiscal Impact: State costs of about $17.6 billion
to pay off both the principal ($9 billion) and interest ($8.6
billion) on the bonds. Payments of about $500 million per
year for 35 years.

OYES

ON0

PROPOSITION 52

MEDI-CAL HOSPITAL FEE PROGRAM. INITIATIVE
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT AND STATUTE.

Extends indefinitely an existing statute that imposes fees
on hospitals to fund Medi-Cal health care services, care for
uninsured patients, and children’s health coverage. Fiscal
Impact: Uncertain fiscal effect, ranging from relatively little
impact to annual state General Fund savings of around $1
billion and increased funding for public hospitals in the low
hundreds of millions of dollars annually.

O YES

O N0

PROPOSITION 53

REVENUE BONDS. STATEWIDE VOTER APPROVAL.
INITIATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. Requires
statewide voter approval before any revenue bonds can be
issued or sold by the state for certain projects if the bond
amount exceeds $2 billion. Fiscal Impact: State and local
fiscal effects are unknown and would depend on which
projects are affected by the measure and what actions
government agencies and voters take in response to the
measure’s voting requirement.

PROPOSITION 55

TAX EXTENSION TO FUND EDUCATION AND
HEALTHCARE. INITIATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL
AMENDMENT. Extends by twelve years the temporary
personal income tax increases enacted in 2012 on
earnings over $250,000, with revenues allocated to K-12
schools, California Community Colleges, and, in certain
years, healthcare. Fiscal Impact: Increased state
revenues - $4 billion to $9 billion annually from 2019-2030 -
depending on economy and stock market. Increased
funding for schools, community colleges, health care for
low-income people, budget reserves, and debt payments.

O YES
O NO
PROPOSITION 56

CIGARETTE TAX TO FUND HEALTHCARE, TOBACCO
USE PREVENTION, RESEARCH, AND LAW
ENFORCEMENT. INITIATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL
AMENDMENT AND STATUTE. Increases cigarette tax by
$2.00 per pack, with equivalent increase on other tobacco
products and electronic cigarettes containing nicotine.
Fiscal Impact: Additional net state revenue of $1 billion to
$1.4 billion in 2017-18, with potentially lower revenues in
future years. Revenues would be used primarily to
augment spending on health care for low-income
Californians.

OYES

ON0

PROPOSITION 57

CRIMINAL SENTENCES. PAROLE. JUVENILE
CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS AND SENTENCING.
INITIATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT AND
STATUTE. Allows parole consideration for nonviolent
felons. Authorizes sentence credits for rehabilitation, good

U.S. REPRESENTATIVE, 24™ CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT
SALUD CARBAJAL

Occupation: Member, Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors

Education and Qualifications: I’m Salud Carbajal. I’m a proud husband, father, and Marine
Corps veteran. I was the first in my family to graduate from a university, working two jobs to pay
for my education at UCSB. I know what it’s like to struggle, and I’m committed to making sure
other families have the same opportunities I had to get ahead.

For the last 12 years as a Santa Barbara County Supervisor, I’ve strived to represent our
Central Coast values. I’m proud to have earned endorsements from Planned Parenthood and
the Sierra Club for standing up for women’s reproductive rights, fighting for marriage equality,
and protecting our environment.

I’ve worked with my Democratic and Republican colleagues to expand health insurance to

14,000	county children; invested in widening Highway 101 and other roads projects to reduce
congestion; and protected funding for public safety to keep our communities safe, even during
tough economic times. We’ve done that while using your tax dollars wisely-balancing the
budget every year, building up the largest rainy day fund in County history, and earning the
highest bond rating in the state.

In Congress, I'll bring that same bipartisan spirit to tackling big issues: bringing down the cost
of college; protecting our environment; creating new jobs by supporting small businesses and
renewable energy; defeating ISIS; passing comprehensive immigration reform; reducing gun
violence; and standing up for women’s rights and health care access.

support on November 8th. Thank you.

Occupation: Vice President of Local Small Business, Third Generation Cattle Rancher

Education and Qualifications: I'm running for Congress to get it working again for the
American people, to bring true representation for the Central Coast to Washington, and to
solve long-range issues that will affect this and future generations with new leadership and 21st
century solutions.

Born and raised on the Central Coast, I attended Santa Barbara High School and continued my
education at UCLA. After playing and coaching football at my alma mater, I worked for a senior
member of Congress where I led a staff delegation to the Syrian border in Turkey and saw first-
hand the instability in the region, helped draft several bills, built consensus among members,
and successfully moved things forward.

A third generation California cattle rancher and Vice President of my family’s manufacturing
and distribution small business, I understand the burdensome taxes and regulations coming
out of Washington, and the implications it has on businesses, our agricultural community and
job opportunities along the Central Coast. I’ve seen the dysfunction, polarization and empty
rhetoric coming out of Washington from my time spent on Capitol Hill and I know how to fix it.

As your representative, I’ll work to reduce the out of control national debt and overregulation on
Central Coast businesses, invest in infrastructure to bring long-range solutions to California’s
water crisis, improve our education, ensure economic stability and local job opportunities for
generations to come, and advocate for a concerted approach to our national security in order to
provide a better way forward for all Americans. Learn more: www.justinfareed.com

STATE SENATOR, 17™ DISTRICT

Age: 65

BILL MONNING

Occupation: CA State Senator

Education and Qualifications: Eight years ago, you sent me to Sacramento to make a
difference, and I am proud of what we have been able to accomplish together. Since joining
the State Legislature, I’ve authored over 80 bills signed into law by the Governor, including the
ground-breaking End of Life Options Act to give terminally ill patients a compassionate way to
take control of their own lives - subject to strict guidelines.

After years of hard work with many key partners, the new California Central Coast Veterans
Cemetery is scheduled to open this fall. My legislation in Sacramento and ability to secure
funding helped break the logjam to honor those who served our nation with a final resting
place, fulfilling a promise made over two decades ago.

In Sacramento, we’ve passed balanced, on-time budgets six years in a row and put the State’s
fiscal house in order. We’ve made great strides toward tackling our State’s pension obligations
while restoring critical funding to education, healthcare, and public safety. I’ve earned the
highest ratings from the California Labor Federation, the California League of Conservation
Voters, the Sierra Club, and the Consumer Federation of California.

While our economy has recovered since the Great Recession, we must continue to focus on
creating jobs by strengthening the backbones of our local economy: agriculture, tourism, and
our educational institutions.

That’s why I’m asking you to send me to the State Senate for another term. Please visit
www.billmonning.org. I’d be honored by your vote on November 8th. Thank you.

PALMER KAIN	Age:	37

Education and Qualifications: During my service in the U.S. Army stationed overseas, I
developed a powerful work ethic and was instilled with a deeper commitment to duty, honor
and justice. I have built a strong track record as a capable manager of people, resources and
logistics while proving myself as a leader who fosters unity and consensus to complete any
mission he is chosen to lead. My mission as your next State Senator is to defend the freedom,
rights, and quality of life of all citizens of the 17th District.

In more than twenty years of experience in local, state, and national politics, I have learned
how to create tangible, positive change in a system that often suppresses it. For decades, our
district and state have used short-term solutions for long-term problems. The consequences
being a rise in crime, homelessness, unemployment, tax rates, public corruption and inequality.
We cannot afford to be complacent anymore. Sacramento has no long-term sustainable action
plans, I do.

Sacramento has chosen to serve the needs of special interest groups while neglecting the
people of California. I will return the power back to the people, to usher in a new era of
transparency, accountability, and community engagement in politics. There is a new day
dawning in California. Visit palmerkain.org to see my vision and plan. Vote for Palmer Kain on
November 8, and I promise to work hard in your best interest as your next State Senator. Let’s
shatter the status quo and transform California together.

estatal, he sido el autor de mas de 80 proyectos de ley que fueron promulgados por el Gobernador,

Despues de anos de trabajo arduo con muchos socios claves, esta programada para el otono
la apertura del nuevo Cementerio para Veteranos de la Costa Central de California. Mi
legislation en Sacramento y mi habilidad para asegurar financiamiento ayudaron a romper el
bloqueo para honrar a aquellos que sirvieron a la nation con un lugar en el que pueden
descansarfinalmente, cumpliendo con la promesa que se hizo hace mas de dos decadas.

En Sacramento, aprobamos presupuestos equilibrados y a tiempo por seis anos consecutivos

JORDAN CUNNINGHAM
Occupation: Businessman, School Trustee

Education and Qualifications: It’s no secret that Sacramento can do better. I am a policy-
oriented small businessman, a school trustee, and a former prosecutor. I am running to bring
common sense back to our state government and make it work better for families on the
Central Coast.

Each year, businesses leave California for more business-friendly states, taking good jobs with
them. It’s time to turn the tide. The California Small Business Association supports my vision for
a growing economy. They know that I will use my experience as past President of the Central
Coast Taxpayers Association to fight the tax increases and regulatory burdens that are costing
us jobs.

Failed policies from Sacramento have endangered our neighborhoods. As a former prosecutor,
I know what we need to make our community safer. District Attorney Dan Dow and Sheriff Ian
Parkinson have endorsed me because of my dedication to public safety.

California’s future workforce is a direct product of our education system. We must do
everything we can to support our schools, and to make our public colleges affordable for
working families. I have worked with students, parents, and teachers as a school trustee. This
election cycle I am one of the only candidates in the state endorsed by both the California
Teachers Association and the California Charter School Association because of my pragmatic
vision for improving our schools.

I will be accountable to you, providing common-sense leadership and a voice for the Central
Coast and our values. I hope to earn your vote.

To repair, improve and equip Lillian Larsen and Cappy Culver Schools

security fencing for improved student safety, and upgraded heating/air
conditioning systems, shall San Miguel Joint Union School District be
authorized to issue $5.9 million of bonds with interest rates below legal
limits, annual audits, independent citizens’ oversight, all funds spent locally
and no money used for administrative salaries or taken by the State and
spent elsewhere?

Bonds—Yes	Bonds—No

BOND AUTHORIZATION

By approval of this proposition by at least 55 percent of the registered voters voting on the
measure, the San Miguel Joint Union School District (the "District") will be authorized to issue
and sell bonds of up to $5,900,000 in aggregated principal at interest rates not in excess of the
legal limit and to provide financing for the specific projects listed in the Bond Project List
described below, subject to all the accountability requirements specified below.

The Bonds may be issued under the provisions of the California Education Code (starting at
Section 15100), under the provisions of the California Government Code (starting at Section
53506), or under any other provision of law authorizing the issuance of general obligation
bonds by school districts. The Bonds may be issued in series by the District from time to time,
and each series of Bonds shall mature within the legal limitations set forth in the applicable law
under which the Bonds are issued.

FINANCING PLAN

The District intends to use the Bonds to modernize, replace, renovate, construct, equip, acquire
and rebuild the District facilities on the Bond Project List.

All Bonds will be sold as current interest bonds and the use of capital appreciation bonds will
not be permitted. No series of Bonds will be issued if such issuance would cause the tax rate
levied to pay debt service on all of the outstanding Bonds to exceed $30 per year per $100,000
of taxable property, based on projections made by the District at the time of issuance of such
series of Bonds.

The provisions in this section are specifically included in this proposition in order that the voters
and taxpayers in the District may be assured that their money will be spent wisely.
Expenditures to address specific facilities needs of the District will be in compliance with the

performance audit to ensure that the bond proceeds have been expended only on the school

with the Governing Board, the first report to be filed not later than one year after the issuance

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE D-16

This measure will determine whether the San Miguel Joint Union School District ("the
District”) shall issue $5.9 million in bonds for the purpose of improving school facilities within
the District. The measure, placed on the ballot by the District’s governing board ("the Board”),
will become effective only if fifty-five percent (55%) of the voters vote “yes” on the measure.

On November 7, 2000, California voters passed “Proposition 39,” amending Article
XIIIA, section 1(b)(3) of the California Constitution. That amendment authorizes the District to
incur bonded indebtedness for the purpose of financing the construction, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, or replacement of school facilities, in accordance with certain accountability
requirements. To implement the requirements of Proposition 39, the Legislature enacted the
“Strict Accountability in Local School Construction Bond Act of 2000” (Educ. Code, § 15264, et
seq.; “the Act”). This measure is proposed in accordance with the Act.

If approved, the measure will authorize the District to issue up to $5.9 million in
general obligation bonds, to bear interest at a rate not to exceed the maximum permitted by
law. School facility improvement projects to be funded by bond proceeds are included in the
Bond Project List (in the full-text of the measure). In accordance with the Act, the Board has
certified that it has evaluated safety, class size reduction, enrollment growth and information
technology needs in developing the Bond Project List.

Revenue from bond sales will be used only to modernize, replace, renovate,
construct, equip, acquire and rebuild District facilities, and not for any other purpose, including
teacher and employee salaries and other school operating expenses. Approval of the bond
measure does not guarantee that particular projects will be funded.

Principal and interest on the bonds will be payable from the proceeds of ad valorem
taxes levied annually on taxable real property within the District. These taxes would be in
addition to the property taxes currently levied on taxpayers owning real property within the
District. The amount of the increased taxes each year would depend upon the amount needed
to pay the principal and interest on the bonds. The District’s Tax Rate Statement, which
accompanies this analysis, reflects an estimate of the maximum property tax levies required to
service the bonds. The actual tax rates may vary depending on the timing of sales, number of
bonds sold, and increases in assessed valuations.

Performance and financial audits must be performed annually to ensure that bond
proceeds are spent only as specified in the measure. An independent citizens’ oversight
committee will monitor expenditures and provide oversight. Bond proceeds will be deposited in
a separate account. As long as any bond proceeds remain unexpended, annual reports will be
filed with the Board stating the amount of funds collected and expended, and the status of the
projects authorized by the measure.

A “yes” vote on this measure is a vote in favor of the District issuing $5.9 million in
bonds for the purposes set forth in the full-text of the measure.

A “no” vote on this measure is a vote against the District issuing $5.9 million in bonds
for the purposes set forth in the full-text of the measure.

TAX RATE STATEMENT FOR MEASURE D-16

An election will be held in the San Miguel Joint Union School District (the “District”)
on November 8, 2016, to authorize the sale of up to $5,900,000 in bonds of the District to
continue improving the quality of education in local schools of the District. Specifically, bond
proceeds shall be utilized for the purposes of replacing, renovating, constructing, equipping,
acquiring, and rebuilding school facilities.

If the bonds are authorized and sold, debt service thereon will be payable from the
proceeds of tax levies made upon the taxable property in the District. The following information
is provided in compliance with Sections 9400-9404 of the Elections Code of the State of
California.

1.	The best estimate of the tax which would be required to be levied to fund
this bond issue during the first fiscal year after the sale of the first series of bonds, based on
estimated assessed valuations available at the time of filing of this statement, is $0.02855 per
$100 ($28.55 per $100,000) of assessed valuation in fiscal year 2017 - 2018.

2.	The best estimate of the tax which would be required to be levied to fund
this bond issue during the first fiscal year after the sale of the last series of bonds, based on
estimated assessed valuations available at the time of filing of this statement, is $0.02855 per
$100 ($28.55 per $100,000) of assessed valuation in fiscal year 2017 - 2018.

3.	The best estimate of the highest tax rate which would be required to be
levied to fund this bond issue, based on estimated assessed valuations available at the time of
filing of this statement, is $0.02855 per $100 ($28.55 per $100,000) of assessed valuation in
fiscal years 2017-2018.

4.	The best estimate of the average tax rate which would be required to be
levied to fund this bond issue during the life of the bonds, based on estimated assessed
valuations available at the time of filing of this statement, is $0.02855 per $100 ($28.55 per
$100,000) of assessed valuation.

5.	The best estimate of the total debt service, including principal and interest,
that would be required to be repaid if all the bonds are issued and sold is $10,530,000.

Voters should note that the estimated tax rates are based on the ASSESSED VALUE
of taxable property on the County’s official tax rolls, not on the property’s market value.
Property owners should consult their own property tax bills to determine their property’s
assessed value and any applicable tax exemptions.

Attention of all voters is directed to the fact that the foregoing information is based
upon the District’s projections and estimates only, which are not binding upon the District. The
actual tax rates and the years in which they will apply may vary from those presently estimated,
due to variations from these estimates in the timing of bond sales, the amount of bonds sold
and market interest rates at the time of each sale, and actual assessed valuations over the
term of repayment of the bonds.

The dates of sale and the amount of bonds sold at any given time will be determined
by the District based on the need for construction funds and other factors, including the legal
limitations on bonds approved by a 55% vote. The actual interest rates at which the bonds will
be sold will depend on the bond market at the time of each sale. Actual future assessed
valuation will depend upon the amount and value of taxable property within the District as
determined by the County Assessor in the annual assessment and the equalization process.

up to $114,000,000 in bonds of the District to finance school facilities
as described in the proposition. If the bonds are approved, the District
expects to issue the Bonds in multiple series over time. Principal and
interest on the bonds will be payable from the proceeds of tax levies
made upon the taxable property in the District. The following information
is provided in compliance with Sections 9400 through 9404 of the

the first series of bonds, based on estimated assessed valuations

to be levied to fund this bond issue, based on estimated assessed
valuations available at the time of filing of this statement, is 3.00
cents per $100 ($30.00 per $100,000) of assessed valuation and is
expected to remain approximately the same in each year during the
term of repayment of the bonds.

4.	The best estimate of the total debt service, including the principal
and interest, that would be required to be repaid if all of the bonds
are issued and sold is approximately $193,000,000.

Voters should note that estimated tax rates are based on the ASSESSED
VALUE of taxable property on the County’s official tax rolls, not on the
property’s market value, which could be more or less than the assessed
value. In addition, taxpayers eligible for a property tax exemption, such
as the homeowner's exemption, will be taxed at a lower effective tax rate
than described above. Certain taxpayers may also be eligible to postpone
payment of taxes. Property owners should consult their own property tax
bills and tax advisors to determine their property’s assessed value and
any applicable tax exemptions.

Attention of all voters is directed to the fact that the foregoing information
is based upon the District’s projections and estimates only, which are
not binding upon the District. The actual tax rates and the years in which
they will apply, and the actual total debt service, may vary from those
presently estimated, due to variations from these estimates in the timing
of bond sales, the amount of bonds sold and market interest rates at
the time of each sale, and actual assessed valuations over the term of
repayment of the bonds. The dates of sale and the amount of bonds sold
at any given time will be determined by the District based on need for
construction funds and other factors, including the legal limitations on
bonds approved by a 55% affirmative vote. The actual interest rates at
which the bonds will be sold will depend on the bond market at the time of
each sale. Actual future assessed valuation will depend upon the amount
and value of taxable property within the District as determined by the
County Assessor in the annual assessment and the equalization process.

This Proposition may be known and referred to as the “Santa Maria Joint Union High School District High School Facilities Improvement Initiative”
or as “Measure H2016”.

BOND AUTHORIZATION

By approval of this proposition by at least 55% of the registered voters voting on the proposition, the Santa Maria Joint Union High School District (the
“District”) shall be authorized to issue and sell bonds of up to $114,000,000 in aggregate principal amount to provide financing for the specific school
facilities projects listed under the heading entitled “BOND PROJECT LIST” below (the “Bond Project List”), and qualify to receive State of California
matching grant funds, subject to all of the accountability safeguards specified below.

ACCOUNTABILITY SAFEGUARDS

The provisions in this section are specifically included in this proposition in order that the voters and taxpayers of the District may be assured that
their money will be spent to address specific facilities needs of the District, all in compliance with the requirements of Article XIIIA, Section 1(b)(3) of

the California Education Code (the “Education Code”)).

Evaluation of Needs. The Board of Education of the District (the “Board”) has prepared a master schools improvement plan in order to evaluate and
address all of the facilities needs of the District at each campus and facility, and to determine which projects to finance from a local bond at this time.
The Board hereby certifies that it has evaluated safety, class size reduction and information technology needs in developing the Bond Project List.

Section 15282 of the Education Code, the citizens’ oversight committee shall consist of at least seven members and shall include a member active
in a business organization representing the business community located within the District, a member active in a senior citizens’ organization, a
member active in a bona fide taxpayers’ organization, a member that is a parent or guardian of a child enrolled in the District, and a member that is
both a parent or guardian of a child enrolled in the District and active in a parent-teacher organization. No employee or official of the District and no
vendor, contractor or consultant of the District shall be appointed to the citizens’ oversight committee.

Annual Performance Audits. The Board shall conduct an annual, independent performance audit to ensure that the bond proceeds have been
expended only on the school facilities projects listed in the Bond Project List. These audits shall be conducted in accordance with the Government
Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States for performance audits. The results of these audits shall be made publicly
available and shall be submitted to the citizens' oversight committee in accordance with Section 15286 of the Education Code.

Annual Financial Audits. The Board shall conduct an annual, independent financial audit of the bond proceeds until all of those proceeds have been
spent for the school facilities projects listed in the Bond Project List. These audits shall be conducted in accordance with the Government Auditing
Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States for financial audits. The results of these audits shall be made publicly available
and shall be submitted to the citizens’ oversight committee in accordance with Section 15286 of the Education Code.

Special Bond Proceeds Account: Annual Report to Board. Upon approval of this proposition and the sale of any bonds approved, the Board shall
take actions necessary to establish an account in which proceeds of the sale of bonds will be deposited. As long as any proceeds of the bonds remain
unexpended, the Superintendent of the District shall cause a report to be filed with the Board no later than January 1 of each year, commencing
January 1,2018, stating (a) the amount of bond proceeds received and expended in that year, and (b) the status of any project funded or to be funded
from bond proceeds. The report may relate to the calendar year, fiscal year, or other appropriate annual period as the Superintendent of the District
shall determine, and may be incorporated into the annual budget, audit, or other appropriate routine report to the Board.

FURTHER SPECIFICATIONS

Joint-Use Projects. The District may enter into agreements with other public agencies or nonprofit organizations for joint use of school facilities
financed with the proceeds of the bonds in accordance with Education Code Section 17077.42 (or any successor provision). The District may seek
State grant funds for eligible joint-use projects as permitted by law, and this proposition hereby specifies and acknowledges that bond funds will or
may be used to fund all or a portion of the local share for any eligible joint-use projects identified in the Bond Project List or as otherwise permitted
by California State regulations, as the Board shall determine.

Single Purpose. All of the purposes enumerated in this proposition shall be united and voted upon as one single proposition, pursuant to Education
Code Section 15100, and all the enumerated purposes shall constitute the specific single purpose of the bonds, and proceeds of the bonds shall be
spent only for such purpose, pursuant to California Government Code Section 53410.

84

Bonds may be Issued in Excess of Statutory Bonding Limit. Issuance of all of the authorized bonds might require the outstanding debt of the
District to exceed its statutory bonding limit of 1.25% of the total assessed valuation of taxable property in the District. In that event, the District intends
to seek a waiver of its bonding limit from the State Board of Education, which has the power to waive certain requirements of the Education Code
applicable to the District. By approval of this proposition, the voters have authorized the District to seek such a waiver, and to issue authorized bonds
in excess of the 1.25% limit as the State Board of Education may approve. No such waiver has yet been sought or granted.

Other Terms of the Bonds. When sold, the bonds shall bear interest at an annual rate not exceeding the statutory maximum, and that interest shall
be made payable at the time or times permitted by law. The bonds may be issued and sold in several series, and no bond shall be made to mature
more than the statutory maximum number of years from the date borne by that bond.

BOND PROJECT LIST

The Bond Project List below lists the specific projects the District proposes to finance with proceeds of the bonds. The Bond Project List shall
be considered a part of the bond proposition and shall be reproduced in any official document required to contain the full statement of the bond
proposition. Listed projects will be completed as needed at a particular school or facility site according to Board-established priorities, and the order
in which such projects appear on the Bond Project List is not an indication of priority for funding or completion. Any authorized repairs shall be capital
expenditures. The project list does not authorize non-capital expenditures. Each project is assumed to include its share of costs of the election and
bond issuance, construction-related costs, such as project and construction management, architectural, engineering, inspection and similar planning
and testing costs, demolition and interim housing costs, legal, accounting and similar fees, costs related to the independent annual financial and
performance audits, a contingency for unforeseen design and construction costs, and other costs incidental to and necessary for completion of
the listed projects (whether the related work is performed by the District or third parties). The final cost of each project will be determined as plans
are finalized, construction bids are awarded, and projects are completed. In addition, certain construction funds expected from non-bond sources,
including State of California grant funds for eligible projects, have not yet been secured. Therefore, the Board cannot guarantee that the bonds will
provide sufficient funds to allow completion of all listed projects. Alternatively, if the District obtains unexpected funds from non-bond sources with
respect to listed projects, such projects may be enhanced, supplemented or expanded to the extent of such funds. Some projects may be subject
to further government approvals, including by State officials and boards and/or local environmental or agency approval. Inclusion of a project on the
Bond Project List is not a guarantee that the project will be completed (regardless of whether bond funds are available).

PROJECT LIST

The Board of Education of the Lucia Mar Unified School District is committed to
maintaining the quality of education in local schools with safe, secure, upgraded classrooms
and labs for career and technology education to keep pace with 21st century technologies and
learning standards. To that end, the Board evaluated the District’s urgent and critical facility
needs, including safety issues, class size, computer and information technology, enrollment
trends and prepared a Facilities Master Plan, in developing the scope of projects to be funded.
The District conducted a facilities evaluation and received public input in developing this
Project List. Teachers, staff, community members and the Board have prioritized the key
health and safety needs so that the most critical facility needs are addressed. The Board
concluded that protecting the quality of our schools, the quality of life in our community,
and the value of our homes is a wise investment. Therefore, in approving this Project List,
the Board of Education determines that the District must:

(i)	Retain all funds to support local students and ensure that money
cannot be taken away by the State; and

(ii)	Upgrade classrooms, science labs, computer systems to keep pace
with technology; and

The listed projects will be completed as needed. Each project is assumed to include
its share of furniture, equipment, architectural, engineering, and similar planning costs,
program/project management, staff training expenses and a customary contingency for
unforeseen design and construction costs. In addition to the listed projects stated above, the
Project List also includes the acquisition of a variety of instructional, maintenance and
operational equipment, including the reduction or retirement of outstanding lease obligations
and interim funding incurred to advance fund projects from the Project List; installation of
signage and fencing; payment of the costs of preparation of all facility planning, facility studies,

equipment and other miscellaneous equipment. The allocation of bond proceeds will be
affected by the District’s receipt of State matching funds and the final costs of each project. In
the absence of State matching funds, which the District will aggressively pursue to reduce the
District’s share of the costs of the projects, the District may not be able to complete some of the
projects listed above. The budget for each project is an estimate and may be affected by
factors beyond the District’s control. Some projects throughout the District may be undertaken
as joint use projects in cooperation with other local public or non-profit agencies. The final cost
of each project will be determined as plans and construction documents are finalized,
construction bids are received, construction contracts are awarded and projects are completed.
Based on the final costs of each project, certain of the projects described above may be
delayed or may not be completed. Demolition of existing facilities and reconstruction of
facilities scheduled for repair and upgrade may occur, if the Board determines that such an
approach would be more cost-effective in creating more enhanced and operationally efficient
campuses. Necessary site preparation/restoration may occur in connection with new
construction, renovation or remodeling, or installation or removal of relocatable classrooms,
including ingress and egress, removing, replacing, or installing irrigation, utility lines, trees and
landscaping, relocating fire access roads, and acquiring any necessary easements, licenses, or
rights of way to the property. Proceeds of the bonds may be used to pay or reimburse the
District for the cost of District staff when performing work on or necessary and incidental to
bond projects. Bond proceeds shall only be expended for the specific purposes identified
herein. The District shall create an account into which proceeds of the bonds shall be
deposited and comply with the reporting requirements of Government Code § 53410.

NO ADMINISTRATOR SALARIES: PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THE BONDS
AUTHORIZED BY THIS PROPOSITION SHALL BE USED ONLY FOR THE ACQUISITION,
CONSTRUCTION, RECONSTRUCTION, REHABILITATION, OR REPLACEMENT OF
SCHOOL FACILITIES, INCLUDING THE FURNISHING AND EQUIPPING OF SCHOOL
FACILITIES, AND NOT FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE, INCLUDING TEACHER AND SCHOOL
ADMINISTRATOR SALARIES AND OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES.

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE 1-16

This measure will determine whether the Lucia Mar Unified School District (“the District”) may
issue $170 million in bonds for the purpose of improving school facilities within the District. The
measure is placed on the ballot by the Board of Education of the District (“the Board”) and will
become effective if fifty-five percent (55%) of the voters vote “yes” on the measure.

On November 7, 2000, California voters passed “Proposition 39,” amending Article XIIIA,
section 1(b)(3) of the California Constitution. That amendment authorizes the District to incur
bonded indebtedness for the purpose of financing the construction, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, or replacement of school facilities, in accordance with certain accountability
requirements. To implement the requirements of Proposition 39, the Legislature enacted the
“Strict Accountability in Local School Construction Bond Act of 2000” (Educ. Code, § 15264, et
seq.; “the Act”). This measure is proposed in accordance with the Act.

If approved, the measure will authorize the District to issue up to $170 million in general
obligation bonds, to bear interest at a rate not to exceed the maximum permitted by law. The
types of school facility improvement projects to be funded by bond proceeds are included in the
Project List (included in the full-text of the measure). In accordance with the Act, the Board has
certified that it has evaluated safety, class size reduction, enrollment growth and information
technology needs in developing the Project List.

Revenue from bond sales will be used only for the acquisition, construction, reconstruction,
repair, or replacement of school facilities within the District, and not for any other purpose,
including teacher and employee salaries and other school operating expenses. Approval of the
bond measure does not guarantee that particular projects will be funded.

Principal and interest on the bonds will be payable from the proceeds of ad valorem taxes
levied annually on taxable real property within the District. These taxes would be in addition to
the property taxes currently levied on taxpayers within the District. The amount of the increased
taxes each year would depend upon the amount needed to pay the principal and interest on
the bonds. The District’s Tax Rate Statement, which accompanies this analysis, reflects an
estimate of the maximum property tax levies required to service the bonds. The actual tax rates
may vary depending on the timing of sales, number of bonds sold, and increases in assessed
valuations.

Performance and financial audits must be completed annually to ensure that bond proceeds
are spent only as specified in the measure. An independent citizens’ oversight committee will
monitor expenditures and provide oversight. Bond proceeds will be deposited in a separate
account. As long as any bond proceeds remain unexpended, annual reports will be filed with
the Board stating the amount of funds collected and expended, and the status of projects
authorized by the measure.

A “yes” vote on this measure is a vote in favor of the District issuing $170 million in bonds for
the purposes set forth in the full-text of the measure.

A “no” vote on this measure is a vote against the District issuing $170 million in bonds for the
purposes set forth in the full-text of the measure.

TAX RATE STATEMENT FOR MEASURE 1-16

An election will be held in the Lucia Mar Unified School District (the
“District’) on November 8, 2016, to authorize the sale of up to $170,000,000 in
bonds of the District to finance school facilities as described in the proposition. If
the bonds are approved, the District expects to issue the bonds in several series
over time. Principal and interest on the bonds will be payable from the proceeds
of tax levies made upon the taxable property in the District. The following
information is provided in compliance with Sections 9400 through 9404 of the
California Elections Code.

1.	The best estimate of the tax which would be required to be levied to
fund this bond issue during the first fiscal year after the sale of the first
series of bonds, based on estimated assessed valuations available at the
time of filing of this statement, is $0.04242 per $100 (or $42.42 per
$100,000) of assessed valuation in fiscal year 2017-18.

2.	The best estimate of the tax rate which would be required to be
levied to fund this bond issue during the first fiscal year after the sale of the
last series of bonds, based on estimated assessed valuations available at
the time of filing of this statement, is $0.04243 per $100 (or $42.43 per
$100,000) of assessed valuation in fiscal year 2024-25.

3.	The best estimate of the highest tax rate which would be required to
be levied to fund this bond issue, based on estimated assessed valuations
available at the time of filing of this statement, is $0.04245 per $100 (or
$42.45 per $100,000) of assessed valuation in fiscal year 2019-20.

4.	These estimates would result in an average annual tax of $0.04101
per $100 (or $41.01 per $100,000) of assessed valuation over the life of the
bonds.

5.	The best estimate of the total debt service required to be paid if all the
bonds are issued and sold, including principal and interest, is approximately
three-hundred ninety-six million dollars.

Voters should note that estimated tax rates are based on the assessed value of
taxable property in the District on the official tax roll of San Luis Obispo County, not
on the property's market value, which could be more or less than the assessed
value. Taxpayers eligible for a property tax exemption, such as the homeowner's
exemption, will be taxed at a lower effective tax rate than described above, and
certain taxpayers may be eligible for a postponement of their property taxes. Property
owners should consult their own property tax bills and tax advisors to determine their
property's assessed value and any applicable tax exemptions.

The actual tax rates and the years in which they will apply may vary from those
presently estimated, due to variations from these estimates in the timing of bond
sales, the amount of bonds sold, market interest rates at the time of each sale,
and actual assessed valuations over the term of repayment of the bonds. The
estimates are based on the District’s projections and are not binding upon the District.
The dates of sale and the amount of bonds sold at any given time will be determined
by the District based on the need for construction funds and other factors. The actual
interest rates at which the bonds would be sold will depend on the bond market at the
time of each sale. Actual future assessed valuation will depend upon the amount and
value of taxable property within the District as determined by the County Assessor of
San Luis Obispo County in the annual assessment and equalization process.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE 1-16

VOTE YES on Measure I to protect and improve the outstanding quality of education that
local children receive attending schools in the Lucia Mar Unified School District (LMUSD).

Our community faces a serious educational challenge: Lucia Mar schools have educated
generations of local children but our schools have grown old - really old. As academic
standards rise, our kids deserve a competitive edge preparing for college and 21st Century
careers. LMUSD’s 18 schools are aging and in constant use, serving nearly 11,000 students
each day. Some schools are now over 60 years old, and all need continuing repairs and
upgrades.

Spanning two years, parents, staff and community members have helped build Measure I’s
prudent, responsible plan to meet LMUSD’s most critical needs. NO other funding currently
exists to properly upgrade these facilities.

SHANDON JOINT UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT
FULL TEXT OF MEASURE K-16

To repair leaky pipes, deteriorating septic systems, aging roofs and
inefficient heating/air-conditioning; upgrade portable classrooms; install
emergency communication systems and remove asbestos; and qualify for
State matching funds at Shandon Elementary, Parkfield Elementary and
Shandon High Schools; shall Shandon Joint Unified School District issue
$3.15 million of bonds with interest rates below legal limits, annual audits,
independent citizens’ oversight, all funds spent locally and no money used
for administrative salaries or taken by the State and spent elsewhere?”

Bonds—Yes	Bonds—No

BOND AUTHORIZATION

By approval of this proposition by at least 55 percent of the registered voters voting on the
measure, the Shandon Joint Unified School District (the "District") will be authorized to issue
and sell bonds of up to $3.15 million in aggregated principal at interest rates not in excess of
the legal limit and to provide financing for the specific projects listed in the Bond Project List
described below, subject to all the accountability requirements specified below.

The Bonds may be issued under the provisions of the California Education Code (starting at
Section 15100), under the provisions of the California Government Code (starting at Section
53506), or under any other provision of law authorizing the issuance of general obligation
bonds by school districts. The Bonds may be issued in series by the District from time to time,
and each series of Bonds shall mature within the legal limitations set forth in the applicable law
under which the Bonds are issued.

FINANCING PLAN

The District intends to use the Bonds to modernize, replace, renovate, equip, acquire and
rebuild the District facilities on the Bond Project List. No series of Bonds will be issued if such
issuance would cause the tax rate levied to pay debt service on all of the outstanding Bonds to
exceed $60 per year per $100,000 of taxable property, based on projections made by the
District at the time of issuance of such series of Bonds.

ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIREMENTS

requirements of Article XIIIA, Section 1(b)(3), of the State Constitution and the Strict
Accountability in Local School Construction Bonds Act of 2000 (codified at Education Code
Sections 15264 and following).

Evaluation of Needs. The Board of Trustees of the District (the “Board of Trustees”) has
identified detailed facilities needs of the District and has determined which projects to finance
from a local bond at this time. The Board of Trustees hereby certifies that it has evaluated
safety, class size reduction, enrollment growth, and information technology needs in
developing the Bond Project List shown below.

Independent Citizens’ Oversight Committee. The Board of Trustees shall establish an
Independent Citizens’ Oversight Committee under Education Code Section 15278 and
following to ensure that bond proceeds are expended only on the school facilities projects
PR-0650-1	95	N	SL	020-011

described in the Bond Project List below. The committee will be established within 60 days of
the date when the results of the election appear in the minutes of the Board of Trustees.

Performance Audits. The Board of Trustees shall conduct an annual, independent
performance audit to ensure that the bond proceeds have been expended only on the school
facilities projects described in the Bond Project List below.

of the bond proceeds until all of those proceeds have been spent for the school facilities
projects described in the Bond Project List below.

with the Board of Trustees, the first report to be filed not later than one year after the issuance
of the first series of Bonds, which report will contain pertinent information regarding the amount
of funds collected and expended, as well as the status of the projects listed in this measure, as
required by applicable California law.

Expenditure of Bond Proceeds. The proceeds from the sale of the District’s bonds will be
used only for the purposes specified in this measure, and not for any other purpose. Such

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE K-16

This measure will determine whether the Shandon Joint Unified School District (“the
District”) may issue $3.15 million in bonds for the purpose of improving school facilities within
the District. The measure is placed on the ballot by the Board of Trustees of the District (“the
Board”) and will become effective if fifty-five percent (55%) of the voters vote “yes” on the
measure.

On November 7, 2000, California voters passed “Proposition 39,” amending Article
XIIIA, section 1(b)(3) of the California Constitution. That amendment authorizes the District to
incur bonded indebtedness for the purpose of financing the construction, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, or replacement of school facilities, in accordance with certain accountability
requirements. To implement the requirements of Proposition 39, the Legislature enacted the
“Strict Accountability in Local School Construction Bond Act of 2000” (Educ. Code, § 15264, et
seq.; “the Act”). This measure is proposed in accordance with the Act.

If approved, the measure will authorize the District to issue up to $3.15 million in
general obligation bonds, to bear interest at a rate not to exceed the maximum permitted by
law. The types of school facility improvement projects to be funded by bond proceeds are
included in the Bond Project List (included in the full-text of the measure). In accordance with
the Act, the Board has certified that it has evaluated safety, class size reduction, enrollment
growth and information technology needs in developing the Bond Project List.

Revenue from bond sales will be used only to modernize, replace, renovate, equip,
acquire and rebuild school facilities within the District, and not for any other purpose, including
teacher and employee salaries and other school operating expenses. Approval of the bond
measure does not guarantee that particular projects will be funded.

Principal and interest on the bonds will be payable from the proceeds of ad valorem
taxes levied annually on taxable real property within the District. These taxes would be in
addition to the property taxes currently levied on taxpayers within the District. The amount of
the increased taxes each year would depend upon the amount needed to pay the principal and
interest on the bonds. The District’s Tax Rate Statement, which accompanies this analysis,
reflects an estimate of the maximum property tax levies required to service the bonds. The
actual tax rates may vary depending on the timing of sales, number of bonds sold, and
increases in assessed valuations.

Performance and financial audits must be completed annually to ensure that bond
proceeds are spent only as specified in the measure. An independent citizens’ oversight
committee will monitor expenditures and provide oversight. Bond proceeds will be deposited in
a separate account. As long as any bond proceeds remain unexpended, annual reports will be
filed with the Board stating the amount of funds collected and expended, and the status of
projects authorized by the measure.

A “yes” vote on this measure is a vote in favor of the District issuing $3.15 million in
bonds for the purposes set forth in the full-text of the measure.

A “no” vote on this measure is a vote against the District issuing $3.15 million in
bonds for the purposes set forth in the full-text of the measure.

TAX RATE STATEMENT FOR MEASURE K-16

An election will be held in the Shandon Joint Unified School District (the “District”) on
November 8, 2016, to authorize the sale of up to $3.15 million in bonds of the District to
continue improving the quality of education in local schools of the District. Specifically, bond
proceeds shall be utilized for the purposes of modernizing, replacing, renovating, equipping,
acquiring, and rebuilding school facilities.

If the bonds are authorized and sold, debt service thereon will be payable from the
proceeds of tax levies made upon the taxable property in the District. The following information
is provided in compliance with Sections 9400-9404 of the Elections Code of the State of
California.

1.	The best estimate of the tax which would be required to be levied to fund
this bond issue during the first fiscal year after the sale of the first series of bonds, based on
estimated assessed valuations available at the time of filing of this statement, is $0.06000 per
$100 ($60.00 per $100,000) of assessed valuation in fiscal year 2017- 2018.

2.	The best estimate of the tax which would be required to be levied to fund
this bond issue during the first fiscal year after the sale of the last series of bonds, based on
estimated assessed valuations available at the time of filing of this statement, is $0.06000 per
$100 ($60.00 per $100,000) of assessed valuation in fiscal year 2019 - 2020.

3.	The best estimate of the highest tax rate which would be required to be
levied to fund this bond issue, based on estimated assessed valuations available at the time of
filing of this statement, is $0.06000 per $100 ($60.00 per $100,000) of assessed valuation in
fiscal years 2018-2021.

4.	The best estimate of the average tax rate which would be required to be
levied to fund this bond issue during the life of the bonds, based on estimated assessed
valuations available at the time of filing of this statement, is $0.03444 per $100 ($34.44 per
$100,000) of assessed valuation.

5.	The best estimate of the total debt service, including principal and interest,
that would be required to be repaid if all the bonds are issued and sold is $5,304,178.

Voters should note that the estimated tax rates are based on the ASSESSED VALUE
of taxable property on the County’s official tax rolls, nof on the property’s market value.
Property owners should consult their own property tax bills to determine their property’s
assessed value and any applicable tax exemptions.

Attention of all voters is directed to the fact that the foregoing information is based
upon the District’s projections and estimates only, which are not binding upon the District. The
actual tax rates and the years in which they will apply may vary from those presently estimated,
due to variations from these estimates in the timing of bond sales, the amount of bonds sold
and market interest rates at the time of each sale, and actual assessed valuations over the
term of repayment of the bonds.

The dates of sale and the amount of bonds sold at any given time will be determined
by the District based on the need for construction funds and other factors, including the legal
limitations on bonds approved by a 55% vote. The actual interest rates at which the bonds will
be sold will depend on the bond market at the time of each sale. Actual future assessed
valuation will depend upon the amount and value of taxable property within the District as
determined by the County Assessor in the annual assessment and the equalization process.

Scope of Projects. The Projects which are described above include all related and incidental
costs, including their share of the costs of the election and bond issuance and costs of design,
engineering, architect and other professional services, inspections, site preparation, demolition,
utilities, and other planning, legal, accounting and similar costs, independent annual financial
and performance audits, a customary contingency, and other costs incidental to and necessary
for completion of the listed Projects.

In addition to the Projects listed above, the repair and renovation of each of the existing school
facilities may include, but not be limited to, some or all of the following: renovate student and
staff restrooms; installation of signage, clocks, bells and fencing; repair and replace heating
and ventilation systems; upgrade of facilities for energy efficiencies; repair and replace worn-
out and deteriorated roofs, windows, walls, doors and drinking fountains; improve school
facilities for disability access; install wiring and electrical systems to safely accommodate
computers, technology and other electrical devices and needs; upgrade support facilities,
repair and replace gas, water and sewer systems and lines, fire alarms, emergency
communications and security systems; resurface or replace hard courts, asphalt, turf and
irrigation systems and campus landscaping; interior and exterior painting and floor covering;
demolition; construct various forms of storage and support spaces and classrooms; repair,
upgrade and install interior and exterior lighting systems; improve or reconstruct playgrounds,
athletic fields and play apparatus; and replace outdated security fences and security systems
(including access control systems).

The scope and nature of any of the specific Projects described may be altered by the District
as required by unforeseen conditions that may arise during the course of design and
construction. In the event that a modernization or renovation project will result in higher costs
than relocation and construction, this bond measure authorizes land acquisition, relocation and
reconstruction, and all costs relating thereto, for said reasons or based on other considerations
deemed in the best interest of the District by the Board of Trustees. In addition, this measure
authorizes the acquisition of real property required to expand or provide school facility projects
at the listed sites.

The aquatic facility will be a district wide facility supporting physical education, athletic,
swimming, and emergency water safety programs in all schools as well as for community use
outside of school hours, including senior health and wellness programs. The facility is currently

PR-0660-4

104

N SL 006-018

planned to be constructed on the Paso Robles High School campus. In addition to bond
funding, the District will seek private donations and joint-use funding to complete the project.

Bond proceeds may also be expended to acquire equipment in any classroom or other
educational facility within the District. The District may alter the scope and nature of any of the
specific projects that are described below as required by conditions that arise over time.

Whenever specific items are included in the following list, they are presented to provide
examples and are not intended to limit the generality of the broader description of authorized
projects. The order in which particular projects are listed is not intended to indicate priority for
funding or completion.

Projects Subject to Available Funding. The foregoing list of projects is subject to the
availability of adequate funding to the District for SFID No. 1. Approval of the bond measure
does not guarantee that the proposed projects in SFID No. 1 that are the subject of bonds
under the measure will be funded beyond the local revenues generated by the bond measure.
The District plans to pursue funds from the State of California, if available, to complete certain
of the identified Projects. The District's proposal for the Projects may assume the receipt of
matching state funds, which could be subject to appropriation by the Legislature or approval of
a statewide bond measure.

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE M-16

This measure will determine whether the Paso Robles Joint Unified School District
("the District”) may issue $95 million in bonds to improve school facilities within School
Facilities Improvement District No. 1 ("the SFID”), an improvement district previously
established by the Board of Trustees of the District (“the Board”) under California Education
Code section 15300 et seq. The measure is placed on the ballot by the Board and will become
effective if 55% of the voters of the SFID vote "yes” on the measure.

On November 7, 2000, California voters passed “Proposition 39,” amending Article
XIIIA, section 1(b)(3) and Article XVI, section 18 of the California Constitution. The
amendments authorize the District to incur bonded indebtedness for the purpose of financing
the construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation, or replacement of school facilities, in
accordance with certain accountability requirements. To implement the requirements of
Proposition 39, the Legislature enacted the “Strict Accountability in Local School Construction
Bond Act of 2000” (Educ. Code, § 15264, et seq.; “the Act”). This measure is proposed in
accordance with the Act.

If approved, the measure will authorize the District to issue up to $95 million in
general obligation bonds, to bear interest at a rate not to exceed the maximum permitted by
law. The types of improvement projects to be funded by bond proceeds are included in the
Bond Project List (included in the full-text of the measure). In accordance with the Act, the
Board has certified that it has evaluated safety, class size reduction, enrollment growth and
information technology needs in developing the Bond Project List.

Revenue from bond sales will be used only to repair, acquire, upgrade, equip and
construct classrooms and school facilities within the SFID, and not for any other purpose,
including teacher and employee salaries and other school operating expenses. Approval of the
bond measure does not guarantee that particular projects will be funded.

Principal and interest on the bonds will be payable from the proceeds of ad valorem
taxes levied annually on taxable real property within the SFID. These taxes would be in
addition to the property taxes currently levied on taxpayers within the SFID. The amount of the
increased taxes each year would depend upon the amount needed to pay the principal and
interest on the bonds. The District’s Tax Rate Statement, which accompanies this analysis,
reflects an estimate of the maximum property tax levies required to service the bonds. The
actual tax rates may vary depending on the timing of sales, amount of bonds sold, fluctuations
in market interest rates, and changes in assessed valuations.

Performance and financial audits must be completed annually to ensure that bond
proceeds are spent only as specified in the measure. An independent citizens’ oversight
committee will monitor expenditures and provide oversight. Bond proceeds will be deposited in
a separate account. As long as any bond proceeds remain unexpended, annual reports will be
filed with the Board stating the amount of funds collected and expended, and the status of
projects authorized by the measure.

A “yes” vote on this measure is a vote in favor of the District issuing $95 million in
bonds to improve school facilities within the SFID.

A “no” vote on this measure is a vote against the District issuing $95 million to
improve school facilities within the SFID.

TAX RATE STATEMENT FOR MEASURE M-16

An election will be held in School Facilities Improvement District No. 1 of the Paso Robles Joint
Unified School District (“SFID No. 1”) on November 8, 2016, to authorize the sale of up to $95 million in
bonds of SFID No. 1 to finance school facilities.

If the bonds are authorized and sold, debt service thereon will be payable from the proceeds of
tax levies made upon the taxable property within SFID No. 1. The following information is provided in
compliance with Sections 9400-9404 of the Elections Code of the State of California.

1.	The best estimate of the tax which would be required to be levied to fund this bond
issue during the first fiscal year after the sale of the first series of bonds, based on estimated assessed
valuations available at the time of filing of this statement, is $0.04853 per $100 ($48.53 per $100,000) of
assessed valuation in fiscal year 2017 - 2018.

2.	The best estimate of the tax which would be required to be levied to fund this bond
issue during the first fiscal year after the sale of the last series of bonds, based on estimated assessed
valuations available at the time of filing of this statement, is $0.04853 per $100 ($48.53 per $100,000) of
assessed valuation in fiscal year 2026 - 2027.

3.	The best estimate of the highest tax rate which would be required to be levied to
fund this bond issue, based on estimated assessed valuations available at the time of filing of this
statement, is $0.04853 per $100 ($48.53 per $100,000) of assessed valuation in fiscal years 2017-2018.

4.	The best estimate of the average tax rate which would be required to be levied to
fund this bond issue during the life of the bonds, based on estimated assessed valuations available at the
time of filing of this statement, is $0.04775 per $100 ($47.75 per $100,000) of assessed valuation.

5.	The best estimate of the total debt service, including principal and interest, that
would be required to be repaid if all the bonds are issued and sold is $163,477,337.

Voters should note that the estimated tax rates are based on the ASSESSED VALUE of
taxable property on the County’s official tax rolls, not on the property’s market value. Property owners
should consult their own property tax bills to determine their property’s assessed value and any applicable
tax exemptions.

Attention of all voters is directed to the fact that the foregoing information is based upon the
District’s projections and estimates only, which are not binding upon the District and SFID No. 1. The
actual tax rates and the years in which they will apply may vary from those presently estimated, due to
variations from these estimates in the timing of bond sales, the amount of bonds sold and market interest
rates at the time of each sale, and actual assessed valuations over the term of repayment of the bonds.

The dates of sale and the amount of bonds sold at any given time will be determined by the
District based on the need for construction funds and other factors, including the legal limitations on
bonds approved by a 55% vote. The actual interest rates at which the bonds will be sold will depend on
the bond market at the time of each sale. Actual future assessed valuation will depend upon the amount
and value of taxable property within SFID No. 1 as determined by the County Assessor in the annual
assessment and the equalization process.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE M-16

Paso Robles citizens are well known for their pride in their community and their strong fiscal
conservatism. Together, these two characteristics are why it is critical that we invest in and
protect our community’s most valuable resource - our local public schools - while still
demanding that ironclad taxpayer protections be in place to ensure our tax dollars are spent
prudently and wisely.

Measure M accomplishes both of these goals and deserves your vote. Here’s why.

Measure M will repair and improve Paso Robles Joint Unified School District by:

•	Constructing career technical and vocational education classrooms

•	Undertaking basic health and safety improvements at schools and classrooms built
decades ago - including one that is over eighty years old!

•	Repairing and replacing leaky roofs

•	Installing Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Math (STEAM) labs at schools
throughout the district

•	Replacing aging portables with permanent buildings

•	Retrofitting schools and classrooms for earthquake safety
Measure M imposes tough taxpayer protections by:

•	Ensuring our local school projects are eligible for State matching funds

•	Requiring independent citizen oversight and annual audits

•	Prohibiting funds from going to administrators' salaries, pensions, or benefits

•	Imposing tough legal restrictions requiring all monies to be spent on our local
schools

•	Prohibiting the State from taking local bond funds and spending them in other
districts

Vote YES to improve security and safety at our school sites.

Vote YES to ensure our schools continue to offer students the education they need to compete
in the modern world.

Vote YES to protect taxpayers with independent financial audits.

Vote YES to provide the kinds of schools that improve property values.

To build better and safer schools, improve student achievement, protect taxpayer dollars and
enhance property values, please join business leaders, teachers, parents, grandparents and
neighbors in voting YES on Measure M.

THE SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS
ORDINANCE NO. 2016-01
SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY SELF-HELP LOCAL TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENT PLAN

Guiding Principles and Preamble

The road, transportation and circulation systems within the cities and unincorporated areas of San Luis Obispo County are of regional concern and
the quality of such systems have a direct impact on residents, visitors, agriculture, business, industry and general economy within the county.
Available revenues, including funding from Local, State, and Federal governments, are not adequate to support needed maintenance, upgrading or
safety improvements to the existing infrastructure or the construction of the new infrastructure that the County and Cities anticipate will be needed to
meet the demands of the future.

To maintain and improve the quality of life and to preserve the unique and natural amenities available to all residents in San Luis Obispo County, the
San Luis Obispo Council of Governments has adopted the San Luis Obispo County Self-Help Local Transportation Investment Plan to establish a
dedicated local funding source for local agencies to address special and localized transportation needs, including:

•	Mobility investments for senior, veterans and persons with disabilities.

•	Safe Routes to School projects in every city and community.

•	Public Transportation improvements, increasing frequency and service options.

•	Matching funds to leverage and secure state and federal funding for transportation.

•	Highway congestion relief: US 101 in Pismo/Shell Beach straits, major congested interchanges in North County, and recurring congestion
on Highway 227.

•	Bicycle and Pedestrian safety and connectivity improvements and extensions

Included Safeguards: The following safeguards are hereby established to ensure strict adherence to the limitations on the use of the Revenues
provided by this Ordinance to ensure that funding from the one-half of one percent retail transactions and use tax is used in accordance with the
specified voter-approved transportation project improvements and programs:

Spending Assurances
Local Control
Maintenance of Effort

Administrative Costs Restricted to 1%

These needed improvements will be funded by the imposition of one-half of one percent (0.5%) retail transactions and use tax for a period of nine (9)

investment projects within the incorporated and unincorporated areas of San Luis Obispo County, consistent with the provisions and
priorities of the Plan.

E.	To adopt	a retail	transactions and use tax ordinance that incorporates provisions identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the

State of	California insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and limitations contained in Division 19

amendment shall be made to change the percentage distribution of the major programs (Regional Projects (25%), Local Control (55%), Public
Transportation (10%), and Bike & Pedestrian Safety and Connectivity (10%). The SLOCOG Board may amend the Plan to account for the use of
additional federal, state, and local funds, to account for unexpected revenues, or to take into consideration unforeseen circumstances, if such
amendment has first received the approval of the Board of Supervisors and of the city councils representing both a majority of the cities in the county
and a majority of the population residing in the incorporated areas in the county.

Section 6. Contract with State Prior to the operative date, SLOCOG shall contract with the State Board of Equalization to perform all functions
incident to the administration and operation of this transactions and use tax; provided, that if SLOCOG shall not have contracted with the State
Board of Equalization prior to the operative date, it shall nevertheless so contract and in such a case the operative date shall be the first day of the
first calendar quarter following the execution of such a contract.

Section 7. Transactions Tax Rate For the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail, a tax is hereby imposed upon all retailers in the
incorporated and unincorporated territory of the County at the rate of one-half of one percent (0.5%) of the gross receipts of any retailer from the sale
of all tangible property sold at retail in said territory on and after the operative date of this Ordinance.

Section 8. Place of Sale For the purposes of this Ordinance, all retail sales are consummated at the place of business of the retailer unless the
tangible personal property sold is delivered by the retailer or its agent to an out-of-state destination or to a common carrier for delivery to an out-of-
state destination. The gross receipts from such sales shall include delivery charges, when such charges are subject to the state sales and use tax,
regardless of the place to which delivery is made. In the event a retailer has no permanent place of business in the State or has more than one
place of business, the place or places at which the retail sales are consummated shall be determined under rules and regulations to be prescribed
and adopted by the State Board of Equalization.

Section 9. Use Tax Rate

An excise tax is hereby imposed on the storage, use or other consumption in the District of tangible personal property purchased from any retailer on
and after the operative date of this Ordinance for storage, use or other consumption in said territory at the rate one-half of one percent (0.5%) of the
sales price of the property. The sales price shall include delivery charges when such charges are subject to state sales or use tax regardless of the
place to which delivery is made.

Section 10. Adoption of Provisions of State Law Except as otherwise provided in this Ordinance and except insofar as they are inconsistent with
the provisions of Division 19 (commencing with Section 180000) of the California Public Utilities Code and Part 1.6 (commencing with Section 7251)

Public Utilities Code and Part 1.6 (commencing with Section 7251) of Division 2 of the California Revenue and Taxation Code with respect to
the sale to the person of the property the storage, use or other consumption of which is subject to the use tax.

Section 14. Amendments to the Ordinance All amendments subsequent to the effective date of this Ordinance to Part 1 of Division 2 of the
Revenue and Taxation Code relating to sales and use taxes and which are not inconsistent with Part 1.6 and Part 1.7 of Division 2 of the Revenue
and Taxation Code, and all amendments to Part 1.6 and Part 1.7 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, shall automatically become a part
of this Ordinance, provided however, that no such amendment shall operate so as to affect the rate of tax imposed by this Ordinance.

Section 15. Enjoining Collection Forbidden No injunction or writ of mandate or other legal or equitable process shall issue in any suit, action or
proceeding in any court against the State, the County, or SLOCOG, or against any officer of the State, the County, or SLOCOG, to prevent or enjoin
the collection under this Ordinance, or Division 19 (commencing with Section 180000) of the California Public Utilities Code or Part 1.6 (commencing
with Section 7251) of Division 2 of the California Revenue and Taxation Code, of any tax or any amount of tax required to be collected.

Section 16. Bonding Authority This Ordinance provides no authority for SLOCOG to use bonding to finance transportation improvements or
operations.

Section 17. Compliance with CEQA Pursuant to the State CEQA Guidelines section 15378(b)(4), adoption of this retail transactions and use tax
Ordinance as a government funding mechanism is not a project subject to the requirements of CEQA. Pursuant to State CEQA Guidelines section
15276, CEQA does not apply to the Expenditure Plan (Plan, Attachment A).

Section 18. Maintenance of Effort It is the intent of the Legislature and SLOCOG that revenues provided from this Ordinance be used to
supplement existing revenues being used for transportation improvements and programs. Each local jurisdiction receiving Local Control Funds
pursuant to the Plan shall meet the requirements in that section.

The Maintenance of Effort (MOE) funding for street and road purposes shall be an amount not less than the jurisdiction’s average annual general
fund monies used for street and road purposes during the 2011-12, 2012-13, and 2013-14 fiscal years as reported in the State Controller’s Streets
and Roads Annual Report adjusted to exclude extraordinary local discretionary expenses. In calculating the average annual minimum level, if a
local jurisdiction had extraordinary local discretionary fund expenditures noted as “one-time” or “non-recurring” expenditures in their adopted
budgets, then these amounts shall not be included in the determination of the average annual MOE. A local jurisdiction must supply a resolution
adopted by the local governing board that provides justification and documentation of this conclusion.

Through a petition to the SLOCOG Board, a local jurisdiction may additionally request a revision to its MOE funding beyond the subtraction of
extraordinary local discretionary expenses. In this instance, SLOCOG may allow the establishment of a new minimum level for that jurisdiction's
MOE requirement. A local jurisdiction petitioning SLOCOG under this provision must supply evidence of the need for special consideration. The
SLOCOG Board shall reasonably consider all such requests after appropriate due diligence.

Annually, each jurisdiction shall adopt a resolution stating its adherence to the determination of the average annual expenditures of general funds for
transportation maintenance, improvements, and program purposes and indicate how it has continued that minimum level of funding under its most
recently adopted budget (by July 1). Each jurisdiction shall submit a year-end resolution certifying compliance no later than December 31 following
the close of the fiscal year. SLOCOG shall verify amounts through annual audit reports, council minutes and other legal documentation. An agency
may request authorization to carryover their local MOE requirement for purposes of saving their general funds to apply to a larger eligible project.
The agency must make said request, with justification, in writing to SLOCOG prior to the three year expenditure window. SLOCOG shall reasonably
consider all such requests after appropriate due diligence.

Any agency that does not meet its average annual local MOE requirement over any three consecutive years shall be reviewed by SLOCOG for a
penalty determination. If an agency violates these provisions they may be subject to a penalty up to and including loss of future Local Control funds

J-4

Adopted by the San Luis Obispo Cpiigicil of Governments, July 13, 2016

plus a 10 percent penalty on one year of Local Control funds. Should such a determination be made by SLOCOG then SLOCOG may redistribute
the forfeited local funds and the penalty to the remaining eligible jurisdictions.

Section 19. Creation of Special Fund All Measure J-16 Revenue, plus interest, will be deposited in a special fund for Measure J-16 projects. The
fund authorized under Measure J-16 will be administered by SLOCOG pursuant to this Ordinance and to the provisions of Division 19 (commencing
with Section 180000) of the California Public Utilities Code, and Part 1.6 (commencing with Section 7251) of Division 2 of the California Revenue
and Taxation Code. Any interest generated by Measure J-16 Revenue will be treated as Measure J-16 Revenue for the purpose of using the
interest for Measure J-16 projects.

Section 20. Administration of Plans SLOCOG shall impose and collect the tax, shall allocate revenues derived from the tax, and shall administer
the Plan included in this Ordinance, consistent with the provisions and priorities of the Plan, and consistent with the authority cited herein.

A.	SLOCOG may expend revenues for the actual expense of salaries, wages, benefits, and those services, including contractual services,
necessary to administer the Ordinance; however, in no case shall such administrative expenditures exceed one percent (1%) of the annual
Gross Revenues provided by the Ordinance.

B.	Administrative functions include providing overall program direction and management necessary to implement SLOCOG policy,
formulating organizational goals and objectives, coordinating activities with other agencies and organizations, performing finance,
accounting, purchasing, personnel, government and community relations, and legal matters.

Section 21. Execution of Duties

SLOCOG may engage, contract with, employ and compensate any public or private agency, party, contractor or professional, in accordance with the
Public Contract Code and/or any of the provisions for public employment of professional services for public agencies, for the planning, finance,
approval, design, construction, acquisition of right of way, maintenance, operation, control and repair of any road, highway, bus, rail or other
transportation facility. However, SLOCOG shall not be responsible for the maintenance or operation of any State highway facilities following
construction contract completion.

Section 22. Use of Proceeds The revenues derived from the tax shall be used for transportation purposes only and may include, but are not limited
to, the administration of this Ordinance and the Plan, including costs for initial and subsequent preparation and election, costs for legal actions
related to the election, Ordinance and Plan, and the costs and fees required for California State Board of Equalization services, and any and all
costs and fees related to the transportation purposes set out in the Plan. These purposes include expenditures for planning, environmental review,
engineering and design costs, related special and expert consultant costs, and related right-of way acquisition and the administrative and legal costs
associated therewith.

Section 23. Designation of Facilities Each project or program funded in whole or in part by Revenues from this Ordinance shall be clearly
designated with appropriate project signage, as defined within the approved Strategic Plan, at the project site during its construction or
implementation as being provided by Revenues from this Ordinance.

Section 24. Establishment of Appropriations Limit The annual appropriations limit established pursuant to Section 4 of Article XIIIB of the
California Constitution and Section 180202 of the Public Utilities Code shall be $50,000,000.00 for fiscal year 2017/18. This appropriations limit shall
be subject to adjustment as provided by law.

Section 25. Call for Election SLOCOG requests the Board of Supervisors to call an election for voter approval of the following measure, below,
which election shall be held on November 8, 2016, and consolidated with other elections to be held on that same date. The election shall be called
and conducted in the same manner as provided by law for the conduct of elections by a County. The sample ballot to be mailed to the voters shall
be the full proposition as set forth in this Ordinance, and the voter information handbook shall include the Plan. Approval of the attached measure,
and imposition of the tax, shall require the vote of a two-thirds (2/3) majority of the electors voting on the attached measure at the election described
in this section.

The proposition to be placed on the ballot shall read substantially as follows:

To improve our region's transportation system, by:

•	Fixing potholes, repaving local streets, relieving traffic congestion;

•	Improving street, highway and bridge safety;

•	Making bike and transit improvements within and between communities;

•	Increasing senior, veterans, disabled and student transit; and

•	Providing safe routes to school;

shall San Luis Obispo County voters enact a half	cent transportation sales tax, providing $25,000,000	annually for	9 years,	requiring

independent citizens' oversight, where all funds stay	local and cannot be taken by the State?

Section 26. Effective Date This Ordinance relates to the levying and collecting of the District transactions and use taxes and	shall go	into effect

immediately, subject only to the Operative Date set forth in	Section 3(1) of this Ordinance. The increase in the	transactions	and use	tax, if so

ordered that a display advertisement of at least one-quarter of a page in a newspaper of general circulation be published at least five days prior to
the SLOCOG meeting where this Ordinance was considered. Within 15 days after the adoption of this Ordinance the Clerk of the SLOCOG Board

State and federal transportation funding has dropped severely in recent years, with once dependable funds
becoming increasingly unreliable. Transportation's primary fund source, the gas tax, hasn't been raised in 20
years and our cars are more fuel efficient than ever. Therefore, revenues available to operate, maintain and
improve our local transportation system have not kept up with the needs of our community. Over the next
decade, SLO County's population will continue to grow and our senior population will almost triple. This means
without new funding San Luis Obispo County will have increased congestion, increasingly deteriorating roadways
and fewer and more costly transportation services.

A	new, reliable source of transportation funding is needed

to maintain our communities and quality of life.

San Luis Obispo County voters are being asked to approve a 9-year, %. cent sales tax to address these needs.
Twenty other counties in California have already approved similar ballot measures making them 'Self-Help'
Counties. With these voter-approved local transportation funds, Self-Help Counties are able to maintain and
improve their transportation systems. They are also more successful in competing for funding and leveraging
a larger share of state and federal dollars. Self-Help funds generated must stay local and can only be spent on
transportation.

INTRODUCTION

The San Luis Obispo County Self-Help Local Transportation Investment Plan was developed through a
comprehensive public outreach program that asked residents to identify their priorities for future transportation
programs and projects. Outreach included over 75 meetings with community organizations and leaders
representing diverse viewpoints. Additionally, a series of focus groups representing the southern, northern and
central portions of the county, plus the north coast were conducted along with a statistically valid phone poll. The
Plan has been approved by the San Luis Obispo Council of Governments, all seven cities in the region and the
County Board of Supervisors.

Self-Help in SLO County:

•	Generates $25 million new dollars per year to fix our roads and improve transportation, half of which would
be paid for by visitors to our county

•	Can only be used for local projects and transportation priorities

•	Prohibits Sacramento from taking possession of these locally generated funds

•	Allows SLO County to compete for State and Federal grants and leverage funds, thereby increasing revenues

•	Delivers a Transportation Investment Plan with a list of projects and programs

•	Includes an Independent Taxpayer Oversight Committee to ensure projects and programs in the Plan are
actually funded and/or completed

Revenue Estimates and Distribution: Over the course of the 9-year plan, $225 million dollars
will be generated for local transportation investments. Most projects will be funded by a mix of funding sources,
using the locally generated sales tax revenues to leverage state and federal funding sources. Allocation of Self-
Help revenues is established within this Plan. The estimated revenue and allocation among categories is based
upon 2016 value of money and is not binding or controlling. Transportation sales tax funds shall be allocated by
percentage of the actual revenue received.

This funding will serve as an investment that will leverage future local, state and federal funding. Funds would be
used for all phases of project implementation, including: planning, environmental, permits, and design, right-of-
way, and/or construction capital and operations projects. State and federal fund sources that may also be used
to implement transportation projects and programs in the next decade include the State Regional Transportation
Improvement Program (regional-estimate $25M), Inter-regional Transportation Improvement Program, Fixing
America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act Freight and Highway Projects Program, Congestion Mitigation Air
Quality (regional-estimate $15M), Regional Surface Transportation Program Funds (regional-estimate $10M), and
Local Funding (e.g. developer fees, general funds, and Measure "Local Control" funds).

THE PLAN: LOCAL CONTROL

Local Control', 55%, $123,750,000

Formula based upon $150k base per jurisdiction with balance allocated
by population, and modified in 2022 with new population percentages

Recognizingthat local streetsare the backboneofourtransportation
system, this Plan provides funds to local cities and San Luis
Obispo County, distributed primarily based on 2015 population to
support local roads. These funds may be used for used for any
transportation purpose at the discretion of each jurisdiction such
as, road and pothole repair, sidewalks, bridge and seismic safety
investments, local match funding for highway improvements and
public transit.

Based on local jurisdiction priorities, 4% of the total Revenues
collected will be used for Safe Routes to Schools and Colleges. Safe
Routes to School funds promote the safety and health of children
by funding projects and encouragement programs that improve
bicycle and pedestrian access and safety near or to schools and
colleges.

Local jurisdictions are also encouraged to use these funds for

community enhancements such as improvements to downtown areas, additional pedestrian and bike paths,
wayfinding, lighting, street or median trees and other local enhancements.

Every city and community has identified specific projects they want funded in this Plan.

Allowable uses for the Local Control funding category include:

•	Maintaining, improving or constructing streets,
roads, bridges, and bicycle and pedestrian
facilities,

•	Community Enhancements, such as downtown
streetscapes, transportation enhancements,
wayfinding, and accessibility improvements, street
lighting, street furniture and trees,

•	Safety Improvements,

•	Bus and rail transit services and support facilities,

•	Programs that reduce transportation demand,

•	Storm damage repair to transportation facilities,

THE PLAN: REGIONWIDE

Regional Highway and Major Roadway Projects,
25%, $56,250,000

These funds would be used for planning, project development,
right-of-way, and/or construction of major corridor, capital
projects. Proposed regional projects are at different stages
of implementation. Improvements in the South and Central
County are at a higher level of planning and design than project
improvements planned for the North County.

Sub-regional allocation targets are based on general population,
need for improvement(s), and project(s) readiness over the nine-
year time horizon. This funding will serve as an investment that
will leverage future local, state and federal funding. Allocation
targets are also based on factors such as location of employment
centers and housing, and the net impact to related transportation
facilities.

South County - Highway 101 congestion relief and
interchange improvements - $20M:

Highway 101 in the Shell Beach/Pismo Beach area and interchanges

in the South County area are experiencing increasing congestion during peak traffic hours and heavy summer/
seasonal and weekend events. The traffic flow is easily disrupted by access movements at ramps or lane drops
near ramp connections, includingthe truck lane merging. Potential improvements include: adding lanes, extending
and consolidating on/off ramps, and improving interchanges.

r



PROJECT BENEFITS:

•	Improves safety and relieves peak hour and
summer traffic congestion on US 101

•	Reduces congestion and the disruption of
mainline traffic flow and increases safety at local
interchanges

•	Improves access for local residents and visitors

•	Supports regional travel, goods movement and our
economy

J-16

131

Central County- Congestion relief and safety improvements - S17.5M:

Funding is recommended in the Measure to address emerging traffic congestion in two areas: Southern San Luis
Obispo arterials, intersections and freeways ($9.5M); and Highway 227 south of the airport to Los Ranchos Road
($8M).

Southern Son Luis Obispo City is experiencing increasing traffic on its east-west connector routes
impacting all intersections and the adjacent Madonna Road and Los Osos Valley Road interchanges. Due to a lack
of east-west and north-south road connections, the existing roadways in the south SLO City area must bear the
burden of local and regional traffic, and increasing congestion. Funding will be matched with local developer fees
to improve traffic operations in congested areas.

PROJECT BENEFITS:

•	Improves East-West and North-South connections
within the City of San Luis Obispo

•	Provides traffic operations improvements at
intersections that relieve congestion

Highway 227, which serves as an alternative to Highway
101 during congested periods, is experiencing increased
traffic volumes. Traffic counts showed a 30% increase in
traffic from 2005 to 2013, and, over the next 20 years,
further increases of 25%-35% in peak hour and daily traffic
are projected. Residents of this area have access issues
and serious safety concerns during peak-hour congestion.
Funding will implement a plan to improve the traffic flow
between the Airport and Los Ranchos Road.

PROJECT BENEFITS:

•	Provides traffic congestion relief, and eliminates
stop and go traffic

•	Improves safety at intersections

•	Improves access to SLO Regional Airport

•	Includes safe bicycle and pedestrian improvements

J-17

132

North County - Highways 101 and46E congestion relief - S17.5M:

Highways 101 and 46 in the North County are experiencing minor problems today, but worsening in the near
future. For some interchanges, a safety improvement with a longer ramp or a wider ramp with additional turn
lanes would improve operations (Las Tablas, 46E), others have recurring congestion at the interchanges (Traffic
Way, Curbaril, Main Street, Santa Rosa, 46W). At-grade crossings where vehicles must cross multiple high speed
lanes to turn left onto or from Highway 101 pose another safety issue on the corridor (Wellsona). A similar issue
exists on 46E at several intersections.

Funds would be used for planning, project development, and
construction of capital projects on the corridor, on parallel
routes, and for key interchanges in Atascadero, Templeton,
and Paso Robles. Improvements will be selected based on
their contribution to improving system reliability, safety,
reducing congestion, cost, and local funding contributions.

PROJECT BENEFITS:

•	Improves congestion and highway access at
interchanges

•	Improves safety and access for local residents and
our growing tourist economy

•	Creates safe, improved bicycle and pedestrian
features at congested interchanges

North Coast Highway 1 improvements - $1M:

These funds would be to augment existing funding to
construct an improvement to reduce the congestion,
pedestrian conflicts, and improve safety at the 41 /I/Main
Street intersection in Morro Bay.

PROJECT BENEFITS:

■ Improves major congested
interchange

Provides safe connection from
neighborhood to Morro Bay High
School across Highway 1

J-18

133

Bike & Pedestrian Safety and Connectivity
Program, 10%, $22,500,000

The following proposed bike and pedestrian improvements
are at different stages of implementation. Funds would be
used for planning, project development, right-of-way, and/or
construction of capital projects. Leverage of other local, state,
and federal funding may require improvements to be phased,
yet provide independent utility.

Funding in this program is equitably divided by the four sub-
regions of the county. Improvements will be selected based on
project readiness, cost, benefits and ability to leverage state,
regional and federal funds.

South County - $5.6M

•	Flighway 1 bike and pedestrian improvements
(Pismo Beach to Oceano)

•	Coastal Trail Boardwalk, extend Grover Beach
Boardwalk to Grand Ave

•	Other regional bikeway improvements

Central County - $5.6M

•	City to the Sea / Bob Jones Multi-use Path
(SLO to Avila Beach)

•	Other regional bikeway improvements

place, regional parks and city
services

•	Enhances property values along the
corridors

•	Provides community health
benefits from active transportation
alternatives

•	Creates economic benefits from
associated retail, hospitality, and
competitive events

* Subregional dollar amounts may not total full
amount due to rounding. Actual dollars will be
distributed based on percent share.

Within each sub region, additional projects may receive funding through a competitive grant process to expand
and improve the regional bicycle and pedestrian facilities network. Local cities and the County would be eligible
to compete for funding or cosponsor with other agencies or districts. Funds would be used for planning, project
development, and construction of capital projects, and education programs. Eligible projects include, but are not
limited to: new and extended bike routes and pedestrian paths connecting communities, eliminating gaps and
missing links in the regional network, and improving high use rural roads with wider shoulders.

expended are necessary and reasonable. The audit's results and annual report must be published and made
available to the general public.

Sunset Date: This measure terminates in 9 years.

1% Administrative Expense Cap: Expenditures on staff salaries, wages, benefits and overhead necessary
to administer the program will be limited to no more than one percent of the annual gross revenues provided by
the measure.

No revenue generated from this tax shall be used to replace fair share contribution

from new development: Revenues provided from this measure shall not be used to replace private
developer funding that has been or will be committed for any project to help alleviate the direct traffic impacts of
any new or redeveloped residential, commercial or industrial development in San Luis Obispo County or its cities.

Eligibility Verification: The cities and County will select transportation projects that meet eligibility criteria
as identified in this Plan. The local jurisdictions will certify in the annual verification submitted to the San Luis
Obispo Council of Governments that these transportation funds were used for eligible expenses.

Maintaining Local Transportation Funding Efforts: The local jurisdictions will certify in the annual
verification submitted to San Luis Obispo Council of Governments that these transportation funds will be used to
augment and not supplant local resources spent. For purposes of this calculation an average of the prior three (3)
years spent for local transportation purposes as defined in the Ordinance will be used.

Strategic Plan: SLOCOG will prepare and adopt a Strategic Plan within twelve months of the sales tax taking
effect. The Strategic Plan will include project cost estimates, revenue estimates, other matching funds, and a draft
timeline for regional project delivery. Its prime purpose is to clarify program and project costs, schedule, financial

Plan Administration and Implementing Guidelines

Governing Board and Organizational Structure

The San Luis Obispo Council of Governments (SLOCOG) was designated as the San Luis Obispo County Local Transportation Authority on April
19, 2016 by the San Luis Obispo County Board of Supervisors, in compliance with Public Utilities Code 180000 et seq. If the Measure is approved
by San Luis Obispo County voters in November 2016, SLOCOG will be responsible for administering the Measure programs in accordance with
plans and programs outlined in the San Luis Obispo County Self-Help Local Transportation Investment Plan.

The SLOCOG Board is comprised of twelve (12) members including:

•	Five (5) members of the Board of Supervisors

•	One (1) member representing each of the seven cities in San Luis Obispo County: Arroyo Grande, Atascadero, Grover Beach, Morro Bay,
Paso Robles, Pismo Beach, and San Luis Obispo consisting of members of the city council appointed by the city council.

In accordance with Public Utilities Code commencing with 180100, acting as the SLOCOG, a chair person and vice chairperson must be annually
designated, rules for its proceedings adopted, annual budget adopted, and all meetings conducted pursuant to Chapter 9 (commencing with Section
54950) of Part 1 of Division 2 of Title 5 of the Government Code.

For the number of processes that SLOCOG must also perform to support the Plan, it is recommended that SLOCOG be allocated 1% of
transportation sales tax revenue to address the essential activities described below:

•	Prepare Annual Work Elements, Program, and Budget;

•	Prepare the Strategic Plan every two years;

•	Develop the priority list of Measure projects for regionally allocated funding;

•	Conduct an annual independent fiscal and compliance audit of Measure programs and funds;

•	Conduct an on-going public information program including annual reporting of Measure expenditures;

•	Develop and maintain the required agreements;

•	Allocate Measure proceeds to the local jurisdictions consistent with the Plan requirements;

Implementing Guidelines

In compliance with schedules mandated in federal and state law, SLOCOG regularly updates the long-range Regional Transportation Plan (RTP)
that updates and renews a list of candidate projects for all transportation modes (streets, highways, public transportation, bikeways, pedestrian,
aviation, etc.). If funds are available for any projects (Regional Projects, Bike & Pedestrian Safety and Connectivity, Public Transportation programs)
beyond those now listed in the Plan, they will be drawn from that list for SLOCOG approval within the Strategic Plan. If funds are available for any
projects (Local Control program) beyond those now listed in the Plan, they will be submitted by the appropriate agency to SLOCOG, as described
under the Strategic Plan.

J-24

Adopted by the San Luis Obispo Q^gicil of Governments, July 13, 2016

Measure funds will be based on a “pay as you go” system; SLOCOG will not issue bonds to deliver projects and programs contained in the Plan, but
may advance local or regional transportation projects to reduce project costs by delivering them earlier, if a guaranteed and timely source of funding
is identified and provided that the advancement will not interfere with the delivery of other programs or projects defined in the Plan. SLOCOG may
also consider the use of Tax Revenue Anticipation Notes to advance projects.

Strategic Plan

All of the projects and programs included in the Plan are considered essential to meet the transportation needs of San Luis Obispo County and its
Cities. The Strategic Plan will be the master document for delivery of the Plan projects and programs and may be amended by a majority vote of
SLOCOG. However, amendment of the Strategic Plan shall not serve to amend provisions of the San Luis Obispo County Self-Help Local
Transportation Investment Plan. The purposes of the Strategic Plan are to identify: the priority for projects and dates for project implementation
(based on scope, cost, schedule, and ability to generate leveraged funds of each project), accomplishments and critical issues, details the revenue
projections and possible financing tools needed to deliver the Plan.

After holding a public hearing, each local jurisdiction shall annually adopt by resolution a five-year program of projects including information about
each of the projects to be funded with Local Control Program revenues allocated according to the Plan. Local agencies shall submit their program of
projects in a format specified by SLOCOG and shall include project location, scope, schedule, cost and funding sources to ensure that the program
can be easily understood by members of the public. The program of projects shall also include a detailed description of local jurisdiction
expenditures of Local Control Program funds from the most recently completed fiscal year, including expenditures for Safe Routes to School as
defined in the Plan. Each year, SLOCOG will adopt an annual budget that projects expected sales tax receipts; other anticipated revenues and
planned expenditures for administration, and the local jurisdictions’ programs and projects for inclusion in the Strategic Plan.

SLOCOG will also prepare the Strategic Plan, biennially, synchronized with SLOCOG’s Regional Transportation Improvement Program (RTIP). Both
Local and Regional project descriptions will be detailed and fully defined for inclusion, and will seek to provide geographic equity in overall funding
allocations. It will be vital during development of each Strategic Plan to consider including financing for all transportation modes in order to ensure a
balanced and efficient transportation system. Both the budget and the Strategic Plan will be adopted at a public meeting of SLOCOG. Expenditures
may be made on projects using Local Control program funds only if they are included in SLOCOG’s most recently adopted Strategic Plan. The
following steps will be taken by SLOCOG to prepare and adopt the Strategic Plan:

•	Each agency shall conduct a local public hearing and adopt a Resolution in support of the proposed program of projects prior to submitting
the project list to SLOCOG.

•	Each agency shall annually develop and submit to SLOCOG a five-year program of projects to be funded with revenues made available
from the Local Control program.

•	SLOCOG staff working with member agencies and affected stakeholders will develop the initial Strategic Plan by June 15, 2017.
Subsequent updates will be developed in conjunction with the biennial RTIP.

•	The SLOCOG Board receives the initial Strategic Plan, and its subsequent updates, and schedules public hearings for review.

•	The SLOCOG Board adopts the Strategic Plan.

•	SLOCOG may amend the Strategic Plan to account for unexpected revenues, to take into consideration unforeseen circumstances, or to
revise with the locally approved program of projects.

Other Requirements and Principles

This plan is guided by principles that ensure that the revenue generated by the transportation sales tax is spent in the most efficient and effective
manner possible, consistent with the desires of the voters of San Luis Obispo County and its Cities. Accountability is of utmost importance in
delivering public investments with public dollars. SLOCOG is committed to transparency and accountability as a public agency. The principles
outlined in this section provide flexibility needed to address issues that may arise during the life of the Plan.

Transparency and Accountability

1.	Funds only Projects and Programs in the Plan: Revenues shall be used only for transportation purposes identified in the Plan. The
penalty for misspending is full repayment of all misspent funds and an additional repayment of 10% of the misspent amount.

2.	All Decisions Made in Open Public Process: Activities of SLOCOG shall be conducted in an open and public meeting process
according to state law, through publicly noticed meetings. The annual budgets, strategic plans, annual reports and audits shall all be
prepared for public review.

3.	Salary and Administration Cost Caps: The salaries and benefits for administrative purposes shall not exceed 1 % of the gross revenues
of the sales tax. The allocated cost of staff that directly implements specific projects or programs included in the Strategic Plan are not
included in administrative costs.

4.	Amendments: No provision is included to allow SLOCOG to amend the percentage distribution between the major funding categories
(Regional Projects, Local Control, Public Transportation, or Bike & Pedestrian Safety and Connectivity). Plan amendments require review
and approvals of city councils, Board of Supervisors, and the SLOCOG Board. SLOCOG may amend the five year Strategic Plan to
maximize the transportation funding available throughout the county.

5.	Augment Transportation Funds: Funds generated by the transportation sales tax shall be used to supplement and not replace existing
local revenues used for transportation purposes. No funds may be used to replace private developer funding committed to any project or
improvement.

J-25

Adopted by the San Luis Obispo Qo^cil of Governments, July 13, 2016

6.	Annual Fiscal and Compliance Audits: The Authority’s financial reports are subject to an independent audit by a Certified Public
Accountant (CPA) firm, on an annual basis. In addition, the audit shall determine if funding is compliant with the San Luis Obispo County
Self-Help Local Transportation Investment Plan and Ordinance, and that no more than one percent of the total proceeds of the tax are used
for administrative staff salaries and benefits in implementing the Plan.

7.	Independent Taxpayer Oversight Committee: Annually, the Committee will review expenditures and draft audit report and prepare an
annual report on spending and progress in implementing the Plan that will be published and made available to the public.

Funding Restrictions

8.	Complete Streets: To the maximum extent feasible and consistent with adopted plans, recipients should fully consider the needs of non-
motorized travelers, including pedestrians, bicyclists and persons with disabilities, in all planning, project development, maintenance,
construction, and operations except where such accommodation would be infeasible, illegal, inappropriate, or where the cost would be
excessively disproportionate to the need or probable use. In order to maximize Complete Street improvements, SLOCOG encourages
local agencies to partner with SLOCOG for regional discretionary funds received under State and Federal sources during the biennial
programming cycle and to pursue State and federal grants.

9.	Commitments from Fund Recipients: All recipients of funds allocated in this Plan will be required to sign a Master Funding Agreement,
which details their roles and responsibilities in spending sales tax funds. Funding agreements will include performance and accountability
measures. All funds will be allocated through open and transparent public processes. In addition, fund recipients will be required to have
an annual fiscal and compliance audit conducted by an independent CPA to ensure that funds are managed and spent according to the
requirements of this Plan. All entities receiving tax funds must report annually on expenditures and progress in implementing projects.

10.	No Expenditures Outside San Luis Obispo County: Under no circumstances may the proceeds of this transportation sales tax be
applied to any purpose other than for transportation improvements benefitting the residents of San Luis Obispo County and its cities.
Under no circumstances may these funds be appropriated by the State of California or any other State or federal governmental agency.

11.	Compliance and Consistency with Regional, State, and Federal Requirements: All projects funded by these revenues must be
consistent with the SLOCOG Regional Transportation Plan and are subject to laws and regulations of federal, state, and local government,
including but not limited to the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, as
applicable.

Project Financing Guidelines and Managing Revenue Fluctuations

12.	Administrative Responsibility: SLOCOG is given the fiduciary duty of administering the transportation sales tax proceeds in accordance
with all applicable laws and with the Plan. The Measure monies collected through SLOCOG shall be accounted for and invested
separately, unless and until the funds are turned over to a local recipient in accordance with the Plan. At such time, the local recipient
shall keep a separate accounting of the monies and any and all expenditures to ensure that the monies, and any interest, are spent in
accordance with the approved Plan.

For the benefit of the residents and businesses of San Luis Obispo County, it is preferred to annually expend all Measure funds as outlined
in the Strategic Plan, however, funds may be accumulated by SLOCOG or recipient agencies over a period of time to pay for larger and
longer-term projects pursuant to the policies adopted by SLOCOG. All interest income generated by these proceeds will be used for the
purposes outlined in this Plan and will be subject to audits.

To maximize the effective use of funds, revenues may be transferred or exchanged between or among jurisdictions provided that the
percentage of funds allocated as provided in the Plan is maintained over the duration of the period of time the tax is imposed.

Cooperative Agreements to exchange funds, including fund repayment provisions, must be approved by SLOCOG and shall be consistent
with all rules adopted or approved by SLOCOG relating to such exchanges.

SLOCOG may exchange revenues for State or federal funds allocated or granted to any public agency within the area of SLOCOG to
maximize effectiveness in the use of the revenues. SLOCOG shall maintain for public review an accounting of all balances that are
subject to cooperative agreements approved pursuant to this section.

13.	Programming of Funds: Actual revenues may, at times, differ than expected in this Plan due to changes in receipts and fluctuations in
the economy; additional funds may become available due to grants, increased opportunities for leveraging or project costs less than
expected. Estimates of actual revenue will be calculated annually by SLOCOG during its annual budget process. Any excess revenue will
be programmed in a manner that will accelerate the implementation of the projects and programs described in this Plan, at the direction of
SLOCOG.

SLOCOG will also have the ability to set aside a contingency fund of up to 5% of the annual receipts from the tax. Revenues to fund the
contingency may be accumulated through the following: revenues exceed projections or a project’s cost (exclusive of the Local Control
program) is lower than anticipated resulting in excess funds. When a Local Control program project’s cost is lower than anticipated
resulting in project savings, these funds shall be reallocated to, and for the benefit of, the responsible agency. In the event that actual
revenues in any given year are less than the budgeted revenues, SLOCOG may use the contingency fund to make up the difference
between the budgeted revenues and the actual revenues. The contingency fund may also be used to fund projects where the actual cost
exceeds projections.

J-26

Adopted by the San Luis Obispo Cpppcil of Governments, July 13, 2016

14.	Fund Allocations: Should a planned project become undeliverable, infeasible or unfundable due to circumstances unforeseen at the time
this Plan was created, or should a project not require all funds programmed for that project or have excess funding, funding for that project
will be reallocated to another project or program of the same type within the Major Line Programs: Local Control, Regional Projects, Bike
& Pedestrian Safety and Connectivity, and Public Transportation.

15.	Leveraging Funds: Every effort shall be made to maximize matching regional, state and federal transportation dollars. SLOCOG will give
preference to use the savings resulting from said grants toward other projects or programs which primarily benefit the agency responsible
for obtaining said grants. Any additional, unexpected, revenues received solely as a direct result of the approval of this measure shall be
distributed based upon the voter-approved Plan resulting in accelerated delivery and augmentation of the Plan’s programs and projects.

16.	Advancing Projects: Local agencies may elect to advance a Plan project or program using local funds, other SLOCOG discretionary
funds with SLOCOG Board approval, or Tax Revenue Anticipation Notes with approvals from both the local agency and SLOCOG. The
recipient would be eligible for repayment for the amount advanced (with no interest) subject to SLOCOG approval of the advancement and
the year of reimbursement. SLOCOG will also be able to use other means to accelerate the delivery of the Plan projects and programs,
including partnering with other COGS, the State of California, the Federal Government, and other government agencies, federal
authorization funds, federal earmarks, partnering with private entities, seeking outside grants and matching or leveraging tax receipts to
the maximum extent possible. SLOCOG will have the capability of loaning transportation sales tax revenues, at prevailing interest rates, to
local agencies for the implementation of needed transportation projects, provided that a guaranteed revenue stream is devoted to repay
such a loan over a maximum amount of time, and provided that the loan will not interfere with the implementation of programs or projects
defined in the Plan. Loaning of funds requires SLOCOG approval.

Adopted by the San Luis Obispo Cp^cil of Governments, July 13, 2016

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE J-16

This measure will determine whether a half-cent sales tax within the county will be imposed for a period of nine (9) years in
order to provide revenue for transportation improvements throughout the county. The measure is placed on the ballot by the
San Luis Obispo County Board of Supervisors (“the Board”) and will become effective if two-thirds (2/3rds) of the voters vote
“yes” on the measure.

In 1987, recognizing a need for a mechanism to provide necessary funding for local transportation improvement needs, the
Legislature enacted the Local Transportation and Improvement Act (Pub. Util. Code, § 180000; “the Act”). In accordance
with the Act, on April 19, 2016, the Board designated the San Luis Obispo Council of Governments as the “Local
Transportation Authority” for San Luis Obispo County (“the Authority”). Pursuant to Public Utilities Code section 180206, the
Authority developed a countywide expenditure plan, entitled “The San Luis Obispo County Self-Help Local Transportation
Investment Plan” (“the Plan”). The Plan was approved by the Board on July 12, 2016, and has been approved by a majority
of the city councils representing a majority of the population residing within the incorporated areas of the county, as required
by the Act. (Pub. Util. Code § 180206.) On July 13, 2016, pursuant to the authority provided by the Act and by Revenue and
Taxation Code section 7251, the Authority adopted Ordinance No. 2016-01, approving the Plan and providing for the
imposition of a half-cent (.5 cent) retail transaction tax for the purpose of funding transportation improvements within the
county.

If approved, this measure will add a half-cent to every dollar of an item purchased, with some exceptions. Currently, the
sales and use tax rates are 7.5% in the unincorporated areas of the county and 8% in the cities of Arroyo Grande,
Atascadero, Grover Beach, Morro Bay, Pismo Beach, Paso Robles, and San Luis Obispo. The rates would increase to 8%
and 8.5% respectively. The tax would terminate after a period of nine years. The measure is a “special tax,” not a “general
tax.” Therefore, revenue generated by the tax may only be used for the purposes stated in the measure, which include fixing
potholes, repaving streets, relieving traffic congestion; making bicycle and other transit improvements within and between
communities; increasing senior, veteran, disabled, and student transit within the county; and providing safe routes to
schools. The Plan, which is published in the ballot material for this election, includes the types of specific projects that would
be funded by the tax.

The Authority will commission an independent annual audit by a certified public accountant, which shall confirm that
proceeds of the tax are spent only as specified in the measure and that funding is compliant with the Plan. A thirteen
member (13) member “Independent Taxpayer Oversight Committee” will be appointed. The committee will conduct an
annual audit and prepare a report of revenue and expenditures, and progress made in implementing the Plan.

A “yes” vote on this measure is a vote in favor of the imposition of a half-cent sales tax for the purposes set forth in the full-
text of the measure.

A “no” vote on this measure is a vote against the imposition of a half-cent sales tax for the purposes set forth in the full-text
of the measure.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE J-16

Yes on J

Measure J has been carefully crafted to address important transportation needs. Following are three reasons, why it's a
smart decision for San Luis Obispo County.

First: All of the funds raised by Measure J funds stay right here in San Luis Obispo County to pay for street, road and
transportation improvements. Every dime.

Second: Measure J is specifically designed to prevent state and federal politicians from getting their hands on these funds.
This measure specifically dedicates all funds raised to transportation and traffic-related projects in San Luis Obispo County.

Third: we can't count on the State Legislature to listen and act when it comes to smaller counties like San Luis Obispo. The
Legislature has failed to make road improvements and repairs a priority for places like San Luis Obispo, instead sending our
dollars to big cities like Los Angeles.

By acting locally, we can assure that the revenue we raise here stays here.

We don’t fault our locally elected representatives for being outvoted in the Legislature. Our representatives of both parties
have made the case for fixing our deteriorating infrastructure in a timely fashion. They know that falling behind not only
makes our roads less safe, but delaying needed repairs dramatically inflates future repair costs.

That's why Measure J is so important. Every dime will go to our local San Luis Obispo County streets, roads and
transportation needs, and save us from much more costly bills in the future.

The Measure J plan is sound, and addresses needs county-wide to benefit all of our citizens. It has been carefully crafted to
meet the most pressing needs first, with an eye to reducing overall future costs.

That's the kind of good local management we deserve.

Join us in supporting Measure J, a sound and locally-managed plan that will benefit us all.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE J-16

San Luis Obispo County taxpayers cannot count on the Governor, State Legislature, nor County Board of Supervisors to
make transportation infrastructure a major priority. They haven't! Most cities within this county have a sales tax for
transportation, and now all levels of government are asking you to vote for an additional county sales tax, even though the
already high state taxes and fees designated for transportation have been diverted to the state general fund for bullet trains,
public pensions and the bloated, inefficient Caltrans.

California’s current per gallon gasoline tax, vehicle registration tax, driver's license fees, vehicle license fees, greenhouse
gas emissions tax, and truck weight tax are the highest in the nation, but still result in substandard road conditions. The
Orange County Business Journal reports..."As it is, only 20 cents out of every transportation tax dollar that you pay actually
hits the pavement." Why let the Sacramento and local politicians off the hook, then add insult to injury by asking you to pay
again?

The solution is not more taxes, but it's putting rigorous state safeguards in place to ensure the money collected for
transportation goes to fix our roads. Those cheerleading for the sales tax are the very ones who will benefit through lucrative
contracts, while you, the forgotten taxpayer, will pay 225 million dollars over nine years. Like that famous movie quote, "I'll
be back!'', they will be back asking for more in nine years. Taxpayers need to provide tough love by saying NO ON J!

ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE J-16

Instead of fixing our roads, Sacramento politicians have taken our local gas tax dollars, as well as other transportation
funds, and carelessly spent those dollars on failed programs and bureaucracies. Sacramento politicians have a spending
problem not a revenue problem. They want you, the forgotten and overburdened taxpayer, to pay yet again.

California is ranked 44th in road condition, making it one of worst in the nation. Yet Sacramento politicians have still
not made transportation spending a priority. A State Senate report recently stated that 68% of California roads are in poor or
nearly poor condition. The report also stated the total cost for currently unfunded repairs will be roughly $135 billion in the
coming decade.

Nonetheless, billions of taxpayer dollars continue to be wasted on programs such as the high-speed rail project -- now
estimated to cost over $100 billion. Rather than spending these taxpaying dollars on repairing our crumbling roads,
Sacramento politicians are asking you and me to foot the bill.

Caltrans is bloated bureaucracy at its worst. Currently, the department is overstaffed by 3,300 architects and engineers that
cost roughly $470 million per year. Caltrans' financial books are in such disarray that they have not been auditable to the
satisfaction of the Legislative Analyst's Office and the State Auditor. But, instead of cleaning up and streamlining this failed
bureaucracy, Sacramento politicians are simply asking us to pay more.

Another tax increase is not the solution to our problem. Sacramento politicians need to prioritize spending, cut the waste
and bureaucracy, and fix our roads. They need 'to feel the heat' of you, the forgotten taxpayer, in order to
understand. VOTE NO ON MEASURE J.

President, Central Coast Taxpayers Association	Secretary/Treasurer SLO County Cattleman's PAC

s/Terri A. Stricklin

Secretary, Central Coast Taxpayers Association

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE J-16

We completely agree with the Central Coast Taxpayers Association that Sacramento politicians have failed to respond to
the needs of San Luis Obispo County. The question we have to ask ourselves is, do we honestly think that those elected by
Los Angeles and San Francisco voters are suddenly going to see the light and start fixing our local roads and highways?

Local Republicans and Democrats agree we have to take charge of our crumbling infrastructure, and bypass the state
bureaucracy. We say that because;

a)	The Sacramento political machine isn’t going to change, at least not anytime soon, and

b)	Delaying repairs will only make the eventual costs skyrocket.

In other words, the sooner we get busy fixing the problem, the less it will cost in the long run.

Remember, every dime raised by Measure J stays right here in San Luis Obispo County, for roads, highways and to
meet ot/r transportation needs. Every dime.

Just as important, the repairs and improvements affect every area of the county, so whether you live in a city or a rural
community, you will benefit directly from the carefully crafted and well-designed approach of Measure J.

Our local planners have done an excellent job to make sure we target the most urgent needs first. That’s the fiscally
responsible way to get the job done.

We urge you to join with your friends and neighbors across San Luis Obispo County in voting “Yes” on Measure J.

appreciate your input at 481-5654. I have refused city health insurance, pushed for full
accounting of unfunded liabilities and accounting of staff time by project for full and accurate
costing, and voted against budget adjustments for engaging multiple consultants. I’ve
successfully fought to bring cost effective Brisco Road congestion improvements and preserve
the project funding through SLOCOG.

We need additional revenue from sales and hotel taxes to maintain our outstanding police and
fire services. I’m committed to reducing obstacles for our businesses. Outside the Village, we
need to recruit new businesses that are net positive for residents. New development must
preserve water resources and maintain our unique quality of life.

As your Sanitation District representative, I instigated the audit that found malfeasance in past
management practices and successfully pressed to end costly, counterproductive litigation
against our Water Board.

My engineering experience and law degree help in leading Arroyo Grande toward successful
resolution of our challenges. I’d be honored to have your vote.

Council Member, County Supervisor, and Planning Commissioner. I have a long record of

be addressed simultaneously.

The current city budget deficit overspends by $300,000. I am poised to address this crisis
directly by refusing city health insurance for council members and working to retain business

rate increases borne by ratepayers.

attention to detail and ability to articulate citizen concerns make my voice one of advocacy and
leadership. The citizens of Arroyo Grande deserve a responsive and engaged council—one

our funding an additional million dollars to accelerate fixing our streets and roads.

STATEMENT OF CANDIDATE FOR
MAYOR
City of Morro Bay

BETTY WINHOLTZ	Age:	64

Occupation: Math Tutor

Education and Qualifications:	Morro Bay has been home for 30 years. As an educator, I

have tutored hundreds of students at various math levels: I know how to read budgets and
interpret statistics. I have taught college courses in critical thinking: I know how to question
consultants and reports.

I used those skills as a City Council Member from 2002-2010. Since then, I stayed involved as
a private citizen to address flawed proposals and inconsistent code enforcement. I have
defended the interests of Morro Bay residents and businesses, individually and collectively.

I am running for mayor to offer a course correction. After 4 years with current leadership: (1)
The City hasn't purchased a site, or finalized a project description, for the new sewer
plant/water reclamation facility. The estimated price has risen from $34million to $100million.

(2)	We are told both: the budget is balanced and we have a deficit, which is it? (3) Continually
hiring consultants takes money from programs. (4) Measure D, which protects our fishing
industry, continues to be disregarded and unenforced; (5) Current vacation rental issues are
postponed for 22 months. (6) Commitment to street repair has come down to getting a loan.

Let's Correct Our Direction.

he sido la tutora de cientos de estudiantes en varios niveles de matematicas: se como leer
presupuestos e interpretar estadisticas. He impartido cursos universitarios en pensamiento
critico: se como cuestionar a los consultores y reportes.

Use estas habilidades como miembro del Concejo Municipal de 2002-2010. Desde entonces,

Me postulo a alcaldesa para corregir el rumbo. Despues de 4 anos con el liderazgo actual: (1)
La Ciudad no ha comprado un sitio, o terminado la description del proyecto para la nueva
planta de alcantarillado/instalacion de recuperation de agua. El precio estimado se elevo de
$34 millones a $100 millones. (2) Nos han dicho dos cosas: el presupuesto esta equilibrado y
tenemos un deficit ^cual de las dos es? (3) Contratar consultores continuamente les quita
dinero a los programas. (4) La Medida D, la cual protege a nuestra industria pesquera, sigue
siendo ignorada y no se implementa. (5) Los problemas actuales de los alquileres
vacacionales se pospusieron 22 meses. (6) El compromiso para arreglar las calles se redujo a
conseguir un prestamo.

Corrijamos nuestro rumbo.

HEIDI HARMON	Age:	46

Occupation: Office Manager, Community Advocate, Educator

Education and Qualifications: As a Cal Poly graduate and a 30 year resident of San Luis
Obispo, I see the changes and challenges we face. I am running for Mayor to represent you
and to strengthen communication between the city and residents. I am an experienced
advocate with a history of successfully creating positive change through coalition building,
policy advocacy, and public education.

future. Together we can create a downtown that is more diverse, vital, and welcoming to locals
and visitors alike. Together we can put the community back in the center of San Luis Obispo.

MAYOR

JAN MARX
Occupation: Mayor

Education and Qualifications:	I have enjoyed serving San Luis Obispo for six years as

Mayor and six years on Council. Thank you for electing me. Under my leadership, we’ve been
universally recognized as an outstanding place to live, work and play. I’m proud of past
accomplishments, but there is much more to do to energize our upward economic, social and
environmental trajectory.

A proven leader, I’ve responded decisively and creatively to challenges we face, promoting
fiscal responsibility, infrastructure investment, economic vitality, pension reform, neighborhood
safety and environmental stewardship. As President of the San Luis Obispo Council of
Governments (SLOCOG), I’ve won funding for bike paths, transit, and roads, including the
LOVR interchange and the property co-locating the future bus facility and homeless services
center at 40 Prado Road. During my next term, I'll champion neighborhood protection,
affordable and workforce housing, open space preservation, economic diversification, water
security, new parks and bicycle path expansion and implementing our Climate Action Plan.

A 28-year resident, married grandmother, Stanford and Santa Clara Law graduate, and
businesswoman, I’m active in Chamber, Rotary, neighborhood, conservation, arts and
humanitarian organizations. My experience, effectiveness, devotion and vision make me the
most qualified candidate for Mayor. For a thriving, sustainable San Luis Obispo, re-elect Jan

CITY OF ARROYO GRANDE
IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE E-16

Measure E-16, which was placed on the ballot by the City Council, asks whether voters wish to
authorize the City of Arroyo Grande (“City”) to purchase water from the California State Water
Project on a temporary basis, and only during a declared local water emergency. The California
State Water Project (“Project”) is a water storage and delivery system of reservoirs and
aqueducts. Its main purpose is to store water and distribute it to urban and agricultural water
suppliers throughout California. The Project provides supplemental water to approximately 25
million Californians and about 750,000 acres of irrigated farmland. It is maintained and
operated by the California Department of Water Resources. A ballot measure passed in 1990
requires a vote of the voters of Arroyo Grande before the City can participate in the Project.
The effect and operation of Measure E-16 is that a “yes” vote will authorize the City to
purchase water from the Project on a temporary basis, and only when the City Council declares
a local water emergency. Under current law, after holding a noticed public hearing the Council
may declare a water emergency when it finds that it is imminent that the City’s water supply
has or will become so limited that an emergency shortage condition exists in that the available
water supply is less than the projected demand. A “no” vote on Measure E-16 means the City
will continue to be unable to purchase water from, or otherwise participate in, the Project.

si Heather K. Whitham

City Attorney, City of Arroyo Grande

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure E-16. If you desire a copy of the
measure, it is available on the City of Arroyo Grande website at http://www.arrovoarande.org or
please call the City Clerk's office at (805) 473-5414 and a copy will be mailed at no cost to you.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE E-16 ON NEXT PAGE

PR-0680-1

180

N SL 026-027

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE E-16

Your “YES” vote on Measure E-16 will authorize the City of Arroyo Grande to purchase State
water if necessary under local water emergencies declared by the Arroyo Grande City Council
to meet anticipated water supply needs. Due to ongoing drought conditions, the City may not
have sufficient water supplies as soon as 2018. To meet current water demands, the City
uses all of its allotment of Lopez Reservoir water and a court order prevents the City from
pumping groundwater above its entitlement.

State water may be available to the City for short-term purchases, even in drought conditions,
because the County of San Luis Obispo has excess supply that is available to compensate for
periodic reductions in deliveries from the State.

Access to State water will potentially provide the City with a supplemental water source when
local water supplies are jeopardized. Water conservation efforts by Arroyo Grande water
customers have significantly reduced water use Citywide. Additionally, long-range efforts to
secure supplemental water supplies such as recycled water are ongoing, but will take several
years to develop. Given the uncertainties involving our water resources, it is prudent to have
additional options to secure supplemental water supplies. Approval of this measure will provide
the critical authorization needed to purchase State water if needed to replace the loss of
existing supply due to drought or other emergency conditions. This measure is not intended to
acquire water to accommodate any growth not currently allowed or planned.

The City has worked hard to make available the water needed to serve its customers, but
supply is restricted and options are limited. Your City Council unanimously urges you to take
the steps necessary to help ensure it can continue to meet these needs in the future in a cost
effective manner by voting “YES” on Measure E-16.

CITY OF ATASCADERO
IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE F-16

State law requires each California city to have a City Clerk. City Clerks may be either elected
or appointed. This measure places before the voters the question whether the City Clerk
should be an appointed rather than an elected position.

In Atascadero, the City Clerk is currently elected and serves a four-year term. State law also
establishes the qualifications for a City Clerk, requiring that the person elected to this position
must be a registered voter and resident of the City. There are no requirements that candidates
for City Clerk have any specific education, certification, or experience.

City Clerks perform limited duties as specified by state law, but are often called on to perform
numerous related administrative duties. Some, but not all, of the City Clerk's duties include
preparing, indexing, and maintaining accurate minutes of City Council meetings and all City
documents and records; printing, assembling, and distributing Council agenda materials;
administering municipal elections; receiving and maintaining candidate campaign forms and
City officials' statements of economic interest; revising the City's conflict of interest code;
preparing, mailing, and publishing all official City notices in a timely manner; and maintaining
the Municipal Code.

State law authorizes the City Council to place on the ballot the question whether the City Clerk
should be made appointive. If a majority of the voters approve making the position of City
Clerk appointive, the City Council will have the authority to appoint a person to be City Clerk
upon the expiration of the current term of office, or earlier if there is a vacancy. The City
Council could establish qualifications such as education, certification and experience, and
could appoint the person determined to be best qualified, regardless of that person's place of
voter registration or residence. This measure would not change the duties of the City Clerk as
established pursuant to state law.

A simple majority of YES votes would approve the measure, making the City Clerk an
appointive office.

A majority of NO votes would reject the measure, in which case the City Clerk will continue to
be an elective office.

si BRIAN A. PIERIK

City Attorney, City of Atascadero

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure F-16. If you desire a copy of
the full text of the measure, it is available on the City of Atascadero website at

copy will be made available at no cost to you.

N SL 028-015

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE F-16

The only qualification to serve as elected City Clerk is to be a registered City voter. The
selection of the Atascadero City Clerk should be based on qualifications and experience, not
on the results of a political campaign. There is no guarantee that an elected City Clerk will
possess the necessary skills and expertise. Your “YES” vote on Measure F-16 will convert the
Atascadero City Clerk position from elected to appointed (hired) and is placed before the voters
to ensure the City’s operations continue into the future to be run efficiently by qualified
individuals.

Historically, cities elected the city clerk to perform narrow statutory duties. However, as cities
have grown and become more complex, the duties of the city clerk have significantly expanded
and become more technical. City clerks now require a high level of expertise and training with
knowledge of local and state laws relating to the Public Records Act, Brown Act, Political
Reform Act, Municipal Elections, and the Municipal Code. As a result, 73% of cities in
California now appoint their city clerks.

The San Luis Obispo County Grand Jury released a report in 2010 addressing the question if
City Clerks and Treasurers should be elected or appointed. Their report stated that “Health
benefits alone may be sufficient to attract unqualified persons to run for city clerk, leaving the
work to city staff and costing the cities health benefits for persons performing no useful
function.”

The public deserves the duties of the City Clerk to be performed professionally and efficiently.

The Atascadero City Clerk and City Treasurer urge you to vote “YES” on Measure F-16.

State law requires each California city to have a City Treasurer. City Treasurers may be either
elected or appointed. This measure places before the voters the question whether the City
Treasurer should be an appointed rather than an elected position.

In Atascadero, the City Treasurer is currently elected and serves a four-year term. State law
also establishes the qualifications for a City Treasurer, requiring that the person elected to this
position must be a registered voter and resident of the City. There are no requirements that
candidates for this office have any specific education, certification, or experience.

State law provides that City Treasurers are responsible for overseeing municipal finances.
They must comply with state laws governing the deposit and handling of public funds and
provide written accountings of all municipal funds. The day-to-day duties associated with the
office of City Treasurer for the City of Atascadero, however, are handled by the Director of
Administrative Services.

State law authorizes the City Council to place on the ballot the question whether the position of
City Treasurer should be made appointive. If a majority of the voters approve making the
position appointive, the City Council will have the authority to appoint a person to this position
upon the expiration of the current term of office, or earlier if there is a vacancy. The City
Council could establish qualifications such as education, certification and experience, and

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE G-16

Your “YES” vote on Measure G-16 will convert the City Treasurer position from elected to
appointed (hired) and is placed before the voters to ensure the City’s financial resources
continue into the future to be managed effectively by qualified individuals.

The City Treasurer is responsible for investing and safekeeping City funds. Therefore, the
position requires a person who possesses technical experience and knowledge of public
investments. As a result, 66% of California cities appoint their city treasurers.

The current Atascadero City Treasurer has many years of experience in managing public
funds. However, the only legal qualification to serve as elected city treasurer is to be a
registered City voter. Individuals elected in the future could cause serious financial problems if
an unqualified individual was elected to perform the City Treasurer’s responsibilities. The San
Luis Obispo County Grand Jury released a report in 2010 addressing the question if City Clerks
and Treasurers should be elected or appointed. Their report stated the following:

“There are reasons to be especially concerned about the practice of electing city
treasurers. Any citizen who is a resident of the city can run for the office, without

determination upon the basis of the facts contained in the statement or upon the basis
of any information in his or her possession or that may come into his or her possession
within three years of the date the tax was originally due and payable. One or more
deficiency determinations of the amount of tax due for a period or periods may be
made. When a person discontinues engaging in a business, a deficiency determination
may be made at any time within three years thereafter as to any liability arising from
engaging in such business whether or not a deficiency determination is issued prior to
the date the tax would otherwise be due. Whenever a deficiency determination is
made, a notice shall be given to the person concerned in the same manner as notices
of assessment are given under Sections 101624 through 101626.

101624	Tax assessment - Authorized when - Nonpayment - Fraud.

(A)	Under any of the following circumstances, the administrator
may make and give notice of an assessment of the amount of tax owed by a person
under this chapter at any time:

(1)	If the person has not filed any statement required under the
provisions of this chapter;

(2)	If the person has not paid any tax due under the provisions of

this chapter;

(3)	If the person has not, after demand by the administrator, filed
a corrected statement, or furnished to the administrator adequate substantiation of the
information contained in a statement already filed, or paid any additional amount of tax due
under the provisions of this chapter;

(4)	If the administrator determines that the nonpayment of any
business tax due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of twenty-five percent of the
amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to penalties and interest otherwise
stated in this chapter.

(B)	The notice of assessment shall separately set forth the amount
of any tax known by the administrator to be due or estimated by the administrator, after
consideration of all information within the administrator's knowledge concerning the
business and activities of the person assessed, to be due under each applicable section of
this chapter, and shall include the amount of any penalties or interest accrued on each
amount to the date of the notice of assessment.

101625	Tax assessment - Notice requirements.

The notice of assessment shall be served upon the person either by handing it to him or
her personally, or by a deposit of the notice in the United States mail, postage prepaid
thereon, addressed to the person at the address of the location of the business or to such
other address as he or she shall register with the administrator for the purpose of receiving
notices provided under this chapter; or, should the person have no address registered with
the administrator for such purpose, then to such person's last known address. For the
purposes of this section, a service by mail is complete at the time of deposit in the United
States mail.

101626	Tax assessment - Hearing - Application and determination.

195

N SL 024-038

Within ten days after the date of service the person may apply in writing to the
administrator for a hearing on the assessment. If application for a hearing before the city
is not made within the time herein prescribed, the tax assessed by the administrator shall
become final and conclusive. Within thirty days of the receipt of any such application for
hearing, the administrator shall cause the matter to be set for hearing before him or her not
later than thirty-five days after the receipt of the application, unless a later date is agreed
to by the administrator and the person requesting the hearing. Notice of such hearing
shall be given by the administrator to the person requesting such hearing not later than five
days prior to such hearing. At such hearing said applicant may appear and offer evidence
why the assessment as made by the administrator should not be confirmed and fixed as
the tax due. After such hearing the administrator shall determine and reassess the proper
tax to be charged and shall give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed in
Section 101625 for giving notice of assessment.

101627	Conviction for chapter violation -Taxes not waived.

The conviction and punishment of any person for failure to pay the required tax shall not
excuse or exempt such person from any civil action for the tax debt unpaid at the time of
such conviction. No civil action shall prevent a criminal prosecution for any violation of the
provisions of this chapter or of any state law requiring the payment of all taxes.

101628	Violation deemed misdemeanor - Penalty.

Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter or any regulation or rule passed
in accordance herewith, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction
thereof shall be punishable by a fine of not more than five hundred ($500) dollars or by
imprisonment for a period of not more than six months, or by both such fine and
imprisonment.

101629	Severability.

Should any provision of this chapter, or its application to any person or circumstance, be
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unlawful, unenforceable or otherwise
void, that determination shall have no effect on any other provision of this chapter or the
application of this chapter to any other person or circumstance and, to that end, the
provisions hereof are severable.

101630	Effect of state and federal reference/ authorization.

(A)	Unless	specifically provided otherwise, any reference to a state

or federal statute in this chapter shall mean such statute as it may be amended from time
to time, provided that such reference to a statute herein shall not include any amendment
thereto, or to any change of interpretation thereto by a state or federal agency or court of
law with the duty to interpret such law, to the extent that such amendment or change of
interpretation would, under California law, require voter approval of such amendment or
interpretation, or to the extent that such change would result in a tax decrease. To the
extent voter approval would otherwise be required or a tax decrease would result, the prior
version of the statute (or interpretation) shall remain applicable; for any application or
situation that would not require voter approval or result in a decrease of a tax, provisions
of the amended statute (or new interpretation) shall be applicable to the maximum
possible extent.

(B)	To the extent that the city’s authorization to collect or impose
any tax imposed under this chapter is expanded as a result of changes in state or federal
law, no amendment or modification of this chapter shall be required to conform the tax to
those changes, and the tax shall be imposed and collected to the full extent of the
authorization up to the full amount of the tax imposed under this chapter.

N SL 024-039

101631

Remedies cumulative.

All remedies and penalties prescribed by this chapter or which are available under any
other provision of law or equity, including but not limited to the California False Claims
Act (Government Code Section 12650 et seq.) and the California Unfair Practices Act
(Business and Professions Code Section 17070 et seq.), are cumulative. The use of
one or more remedies by the city shall not bar the use of any other remedy for the
purpose of enforcing the provisions of this chapter.

101632 Amendment or repeal.

Chapter 16 of Article X of the City of Grover Beach Municipal Coed may be
repealed or amended by the City Council without a vote of the people. However,
as required by Article XIIIC of the California Constitution, voter approval is required for
any amendment provision that would increase the rate of any tax levied pursuant to
this chapter. The people of the City of Grover Beach affirm that the following actions
shall not constitute an increase of the rate of a tax:

(A)	The	restoration	of the rate of the tax to a rate that is no higher

than that set by this chapter, if the City Council has acted to reduce the rate of the
tax;

(B)	An	action that interprets or clarifies the methodology of the

tax, or any definition applicable to the tax, so long as interpretation or clarification (even
if contrary to some prior interpretation or clarification) is not inconsistent with the
language of this chapter;

(C)	The	establishment of a class of person that is exempt or

excepted from the tax or the discontinuation of any such exemption or exception (other
than the discontinuation of an exemption or exception specifically set forth in this
chapter); or

(D)	The	collection	of the tax imposed by this chapter, even if the

city had, for some period of time, failed to collect the tax.

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS FOR MEASURE L-16

The City Council of the City of Grover Beach has placed Measure L on the November 8th 2016
ballot to ask the voters to approve an ordinance that would enact a tax on commercial cannabis
businesses which may establish in the City. If approved by a majority of the voters, the tax
would apply to both medical cannabis businesses and non-medical cannabis businesses, if
those are allowed under State and local laws. The passage of the tax would not have any
effect on legalization or land use regulation of cannabis activities in the City.

Measure L, if approved, would tax all cultivation and nurseries at a rate of $25.00 per square
foot for the first 5,000 square feet of canopy and $10.00 per square foot for any additional area.
The tax for both cultivation and nurseries would be paid based on the maximum canopy area
permitted or licensed under State laws and City regulations, whether or not the grower utilizes
the entire area. Dispensaries, manufacturing, testing and other commercial cannabis activities
would be taxed at 5% of gross receipts for medical and 10% for non-medical or recreational
cannabis, if such activity is allowed under State and local laws.

The full amount of the revenue generated by Measure L would go to the City’s general fund
and be available to support a full range of municipal services as determined by the City Council
including public safety, infrastructure improvements, parks and recreation, or other services.

If approved by majority of voters, the tax would become effective once the ordinance setting
the tax is adopted by the City Council and becomes effective. The tax will not sunset and is
subject to annual CPI adjustments.

Martin D. Koczanowicz
City Attorney, Grover Beach

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure L. If you desire a copy of the
Ordinance or related materials, please call the City Clerk’s office at 805.473.4567 and a
copy will be made available at no cost to you.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE L-16

Your City Council asks you to vote YES on Measure L, the “Commercial Cannabis Tax.” This
measure will create a new local funding source from commercial medical and non-medical
marijuana businesses that may be allowed to operate in Grover Beach including cultivating,
manufacturing, nurseries, testing, or retail facilities.

This measure will generate significant revenue that would stay in Grover Beach and support a
range of municipal services to benefit our community such as enhancing public safety services,
fixing sidewalks and streets, improving maintenance of parks and city facilities, and supporting
economic development projects that strengthen our community.

Grover Beach has a long record of conservative and careful financial management and has
emerged from the recession with a balanced budget, prudent reserves, and voter-approved
funding to repair city streets. Measure L would provide funding for services and infrastructure
that would help improve the quality of life in our city.

Approval of Measure L will not legalize marijuana products or businesses in Grover Beach
unless otherwise authorized by law. This measure will simply create a tax on any marijuana
businesses that are allowed to operate in Grover Beach under State and local laws. Several
such businesses have indicated an interest in operating in Grover Beach and this measure is a
proactive way to generate considerable revenues from these businesses to benefit our
community.

Measure L will provide additional funding to support the quality of life for our residents and our
city. We urge you to vote YES on Measure L this November.

STATEMENT OF CANDIDATE FOR
COMMISSIONER
Port San Luis Harbor District

BOBVESSELY	Age:	67

Occupation: Civil Engineer

Education and Qualifications: I am running because I firmly believe in our representative
democracy form of government and believe that our port is a gem, a tremendous asset to the
community. The existing Board has emphasized private business operations. The port has so
much more to offer and could be more inclusive to our residents.

The District should support a wide range of public activities including family picnics, watersports
and sport fishing as well as interest in the history of the port, especially the Lighthouse. Some
people want to camp along the bluff, walk on the beach or on the pier and just experience our
beautiful environment. All of these uses deserve serious consideration and representation on
the Board.

With Diablo closing, and the loss of the substantial revenue generated to the Port, it is
important now more than ever to create a sustainable vision for residents and visitors alike.

As a civil engineer, I will bring a methodical problem-solving approach as well as the
experience to guide the Harbor in an inclusive, open and service-oriented Board. It comes
down to priorities after all, and I believe that those should reflect the breadth and depth of the
diverse population of the District.

STATEMENT OF CANDIDATE FOR
COMMISSIONER
Port San Luis Harbor District

RICHARD SCANGARELLO

Occupation: V.P. Port San Luis Commercial Fisherman’s Association
Education and Qualifications: I am asking for your vote.

Over the next several years, with the pending closure of Diablo Nuclear power plant, Port San
Luis will see a significant reduction in operating revenue. Finding new sources of income and
reducing operating cost will become a paramount issue.

Having owned and operated a small business at Port San Luis I understand the difficulty in
maneuvering the Port bureaucracy. In the future the success of the businesses that operate
within the Ports jurisdiction will become critical.

Creating an attitude for success for those who use the Port facilities will become more
important as revenue sources change.

With your support together we can achieve this goal with common sense and good business
practices.

visited most of the Harbors in California and have an understanding of how the various Harbors
operate. As a current Harbor Commissioner I understand the current issues that Port San Luis
Harbor faces.

I am a lifetime resident of San Luis Obispo County and would like to see the Harbor maintain
its character as a small fishing and recreational Harbor.

I would appreciate your vote.

STATEMENT OF CANDIDATE FOR
COMMISSIONER
Port San Luis Harbor District

JIM BLECHA	Age:	70

Occupation: Marine - Aquatic Biologist, Harbor Commissioner

Education and Qualifications: M.Sc. Zoology. Harbor Commissioner 1983 to present. Port
San Luis is the jewel of our coast. As a Commissioner, boat owner and Port patron, I see three
issues facing PSLHD as paramount.

The development of Harbor Terrace with mixed uses of affordable tent camping, cabins,
restaurant, and gear and boat storage. Currently in negotiations, the project may need to be
developed by the District.

Infra structure maintenance is always important and perpetual. Avila Pier, however, needs
funding of $9 to $12+ million for full reconstruction. Aggressive funding effort is my goal over
the next several years.

PSL must remain a full service port with facilities to protect commercial and recreational boats
year round, to load and un-load vessels, reliably launch and haul out all vessels (dredging), fuel
facilities, water taxi service and a fully functional boat yard. We must maintain good working
relationships with the many local, County, State and federal governmental agencies.

The character of the Port must be protected against the inevitable changes coming to our area
of coastal California. The challenges ahead are best met by commissioners with vision,
pragmatism, and a sense of history. Experience counts. Vote Blecha for Harbor
Commissioner.

para la comunidad. La Junta existente ha enfatizado las operaciones comerciales privadas. El
puerto tiene mucho mas para ofrecer y podrla ser mas inclusivo para nuestros residentes.

El Distrito deberla apoyar una amplia variedad de actividades publicas, que incluye picnics
familiares, deportes acuaticos y pesca deportiva, as! como tambien el interes en la historia del
puerto, especialmente el Lighthouse. Algunas personas quieren acampar a lo largo del farol,
caminar por la playa o por el muelle y solo experimentar nuestro hermoso ambiente. Todos
estos usos merecen serias consideraciones y representaciones en la Junta.

Con el cierre de Diablo, y la perdida de los cuantiosos ingresos generados al Puerto, es
importante ahora mas que nunca crear una vision sustentable tanto para los residentes como
para los visitantes.

Como ingeniero civil, traere una estrategia que resuelva los problemas, as! como tambien la
experiencia en dirigir el Puerto en una Junta orientada al servicio y abierta. Es cuestion de
prioridades despues de todo, y creo que aquellas deberlan reflejar la amplitud y la profundidad
de la poblacion diversa del Distrito.

University of Akron with a degree in Biology and minor in Chemistry. My post graduate work
included advanced accounting and finance courses. My entire career has been primarily in
research and technical sales to energy related industries. I have excellent listening and
negotiating skills having dealt with people from all over the world, many of whom are still in
touch and have visited Cambria. I have extensive experience dealing with budgets and project
management, which will transfer to my success as a Cambria Community Services District
board member.

Honesty, integrity and transparency are needed in our community. Closed door decisions,
without community knowledge, simply add to the mistrust many concerned citizens feel here.
Not all of us will agree on every issue but, working together, we can solve our problems in a
more accommodating and inclusive way. Rest assured I will always be truthful and ethical in
communications to all Cambrians regarding the issues facing Cambria.

Your support is a vote for dedication, leadership and fiscal accountability.

CCSD for A number of reasons. Chiefly, Because of the Beauty of this Jewel of the Central
Coast that I wish to protect, not just for myself, as I live here but, also for future generations. To
protect that future, I feel there are three imperatives to be addressed: 1) Water; Specifically,
ways in which we can recharge and advance our system with low to no impact to our
environment. (Such as Atmospheric water reclamation and recharge) Additionally explore ways
we can reduce the costs of our current system with better technologies that cost less. And, a
renegotiation of our overly costly System formerly known as the EWS. 2) You; The Community
of Cambria (economic stability). I seek slow growth solutions that can help reduce our water
and carbon footprint while maximizing resource utility. Its’ already being done in places like Las
Vegas, we can do it here to! 3) Wildlife; I feel that Cambria’s fauna should be protected. Animal
Crossings, have been effectively put in place in areas like San Bernardino County and even
Canada! If, it can be done there it can be done here too!!

Occupation: Appointed Incumbent, Attorney-at-Law

Education and Qualifications: Throughout my service on the CCSD Board I have fought to
make certain that Cambria has a reliable water supply, that our Fire Department has the tools
to confront the extreme fire risk we face and world class emergency medical services. I have
also focused on the need to upgrade our aging infrastructure to ensure reliable utility services.

Now, more than ever, strong leadership is required on the CCSD Board. To more efficiently
use the CCSD’s Sustainable Water Facility, we must gain approval of a permanent coastal
development permit. To insure that our firefighters have sufficient water to make our
community fire safe, we need to finish construction of the new Fiscalini Ranch water tank and
get others underway. Additional upgrades at the sewer treatment plant are needed.

For more than two decades, I’ve worked hard to help keep Cambria a desirable place to live
and work. I’ve served as Commander of the American Legion Post 432, President of the
Cambria Rotary Club and in other leadership positions. It has been a privilege to serve you on
the CCSD Board. Help me lead the way to keep our village sustainable.

Education and Qualifications: For the past five years, it has been my distinct privilege to
serve our community as a director of the Cambria Community Services District and for the last
two years as CCSD Board President. During my tenure, I have provided leadership in the
following major CCSD initiatives, among others: the Sustainable Water Facility that has
benefited all Cambrians as a reliable emergency clean drinking water source during the
unprecedented severe drought; initiation of a much needed capital improvement program to
upgrade Cambria’s wastewater treatment facility; and, realignment of individual and
commercial rate structures so our water rates are more balanced and fair. I am also proud to
have been instrumental in selecting our new fire chief for our CCSD Fire Department.
Consistent with my commitment to work closely with the community, if elected, I will continue to
work diligently to accomplish the following: secure a regular operating permit for the SWF;
further implement the plan to upgrade the waste water treatment plant; attain a Local
Hazardous Mitigation Plan that maximizes FEMA funding as needed; purchase a new fire truck;
and, complete the initial phase of the Community Park to promote public use and enjoyment.

STATEMENT OF CANDIDATE FOR
DIRECTOR
Cambria Community Services District

HARRY FARMER	Age:	72

Occupation: Gardener, Counseling Astrologer

Education and Qualifications: I have been blessed to call Cambria home since Fall 1986.
During this time I have been an active volunteer and board member with Friends of the
Ranchland that prevented development of the Fiscalini Ranch. The past 7 years I’ve helped
care for the gardens at the Cambria Historical Museum, for which I was recently honored with
the Volunteer of the Year award.

Sadly, during this period I have also observed a consistent lack of good judgment, proper
decision making, fiscal accountability, as well as an inability to listen to alternative viewpoints at
our CCSD in meeting the towns water needs. Our community is now over 13 million dollars in
debt for a water source that, initially described as an “emergency water system”, has now
become a sustainable water source to encourage growth and build out in Cambria.

Our magical town and it’s natural beauty is meant to be honored and cherished, not exploited
for material gain and self interest. When elected to the CCSD Board, I will help to preserve the
rural charm of our town that attracts visitors from all over the world, be fiscally accountable, and
listen to and address the needs and concerns of all Cambrians.

needs. We must continue to explore alternatives to ensure our long-term water supply and
management of our wastewater.

honor a diversity of viewpoints and advocate for a sustainable future. I promise to thoroughly

conduct the first-ever survey of the District’s healthcare needs. I’m now working to leverage the
survey data to recruit the services that people want closer to home.

To sum up: I stand for excellent, well-managed ambulance services and expanded health care
options, all without any new taxes or assessments.
