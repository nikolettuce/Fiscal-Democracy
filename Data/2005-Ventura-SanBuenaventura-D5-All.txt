CITY OF SAN BUENAVENTURA

Should the San Buenaventura Municipal Code be
amended to impose a tax on the privilege of lawfully
operating a cardroom pursuant to a city cardroom
license in an amount equal to 15% of the gross
revenues received by the license holder from card play, all as
more particularly set forth in the proposed ordinance attached as
an exhibit to City Council Resolution No. 2005-068 on file in the
City Clerk’s Office?

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY*

MEASURE"DS"

Measure "D5" proposes to amend the San Buenaventura Municipal Code in
order to impose a tax of 15% on the gross receipts of lawful cardroom operations
in the City. The tax will be collected quarterly. This tax is in addition to any
business license tax imposed by City regulations.

A10% penalty will be assessed for each month the tax is delinquent not to
exceed 100% of the tax.

Cardroom operators are required to keep complete records of all transactions
relating to the receipt and disbursement of funds from cardroom operations for
the three-year period prior to remittance of the tax. The City treasurer is
authorized to audit the tax remittances for accuracy.

Except for the tax rate, the San Buenaventura City Council may amend the
legislation proposed by the Measure by 5 affirmative votes upon a finding that
the amendment is necessary to carry out the purpose of the Measure.

The Measure does not amend, delete, or otherwise affect existing regulations
governing cardroom operations in the City.

'Section 9280 of the California Elections Code allows the City Attorney to
prepare an impartial analysis of each city measure that appears on the ballot.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE "D5"

Voters have an opportunity to gain much needed tax revenue for city services by
passing a tax on the gross revenues received by City Cardrooms. This measure
calls for a 15% tax on gross revenues from City’s only card club, The Players
Club in Ventura.

The club, which has operated since the 1940s, is the only licensed card club in
Ventura. Cardrooms in California are governed by the Gambling Control Act and
regulated by the California Gambling Control Commission. Cardrooms such as
the Players Poker Club should not be confused with Indian Gaming since they
are heavily regulated by the State and are limited to certain games of skill.

The Players Poker Club does not serve alcohol and has been a good neighbor to
Westside residents through the years. Both the owner and managers of the club
are supportive of this ballot measure.

Estimates based on 2003 revenues from the club indicate that the new tax would
generate $150,000. In today’s challenging budgetary environment, this tax would
provide much need additional revenue for valuable city services.

ORDINANCE AMENDING DIVISION 4 OF THE SAN BUENAVENTURA
MUNICIPAL CODE BY ADDING A NEW CHAPTER 4.160 TO DIVISION 4,
ENTITLED “CARDROOM TAX”

THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY OF SAN BUENAVENTURA DO ORDAIN AS
FOLLOWS:

That Division 4 of the San Buenaventura Municipal Code be and is hereby
amended by adding a new Chapter 4.160 to the division to be entitled “Cardroom
Tax” and to read as follows:

Chapter 4.160 — Cardroom Tax

Sec. 4.160.010. Imposition of cardroom tax.

For the privilege of holding a cardroom license issued in the manner provided by
this code, a quarterly tax is hereby imposed on the license holder in an amount
equal to 15% of the license holders gross revenues, which shall include revenue
received by the license holder from per hand money collected, seat rental fees,
tournament fees and any and all other revenues generated from or as a result of
card play, except fees charged to players that are returned to the players as
tournament or jackpot bonuses. Such tax shall be in addition to any business
license tax imposed pursuant to chapter 4.155 of this division.

Sec. 4.160.020. Remittance of cardroom tax.

The tax imposed on cardrooms pursuant to this chapter shall be remitted by the
license holder to the city treasurer within 15 days following the end of each
quarter within every calendar year commencing with January 15,2006. Such tax
remittance shall be accompanied by (i) a tax statement in a form required by the
city treasurer setting forth the true and correct amount of gross revenues
generated from or as a result of cardroom operations during the preceding
quarter, and (ii) a declaration signed under penalty of perjury by the license
holder or the licensee’s management declaring that the information in the tax
statement is true and correct.

Sec. 4.160.030. Audit of tax remittances.

Payment of the tax shall be accepted by the city treasurer subject to the right of
the city to audit the tax statement accompanying the remittance to determine
whether the information set forth therein accurately reflects the actual amount of
gross revenues received by the license holder from or as a result of cardroom
operations during the preceding quarter.

To facilitate such audits, each license holder shall keep complete records of all
transactions related to the receipt or disbursement of funds arising out of or
related to cardroom operations during the preceding 3-year period. All such
records shall be made available to the city treasurer or to the authorized agent of
the treasurer for audit at the license holders place of doing business after
reasonable prior notice.

If, subsequent to an audit, it is determined that a license holder has not reported
or underreported gross receipts generated from or as a result of cardroom
operations, thereby underpaying the tax imposed by this chapter on the basis of
such receipts, the license holder shall pay to the city treasurer the amount of the
unpaid tax due, the cost of the audit and the penalty assessed pursuant to
section 4.160.040 of this chapter.

Sec. 4.160.040. Tax delinquencies.

Any cardroom license holder that fails to pay the tax imposed pursuant to this
chapter when due shall pay a penalty of 10% of the month due for each month or
portion thereof that the tax remains due and unpaid. Such penalty shall be added
by the city treasurer to the tax due on the first day immediately following the due
date and the first day of each month thereafter that the tax remains due and
unpaid. However, the total amount of such penalty shall not exceed 100% of the
tax that was due but not paid in a timely manner.

If the tax due date falls on a Saturday, a Sunday, or a state or national holiday,
payment of the tax may be made without penally on the first day thereafter.

For purposes of this section, postmarks shall be accepted as the date of
payment provided the transmitting envelope contains the postmark of United
States Postal Service indicating a date not later than the due date.

Sec. 4.160.050. Chapter amendments.

This chapter may be amended or repealed by ordinance approved by the
electors of the City of San Buenaventura. Except for the tax imposed pursuant to
section 4.160.010, this chapter may also be amended from time to time, by
ordinance adopted by 5 affirmative votes of the members of the City Council
upon a finding by the Council that such amendment is necessary to carry out the
purposes of this chapter.
