WINDSOR FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT
MEASURE V

Shall Windsor Fire Protection District Ordinance No.

V 2004-01 be approved (i) authorizing the District to impose
and levy a new special tax having a maximum rate
(subject to adjustment for inflation) of $112.00 per unit of
risk to assist in meeting the costs of providing authorized services
and exercising other rights and powers of the District, (ii)
increasing the District’s appropriations limit to permit spending of
all proceeds of the new special tax, and (iii) repealing the District’s
existing special tax?

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE V

Vote yes on Measure V-your safety depends on it.

Passage of this initiative will allow WFPD to do the following: Improve response
times to an acceptable level; Increase present staffing to minimum acceptable lev-
els; Add fulltime staff to downtown-area station.

Facts to consider: Response times are not meeting national fire service standards.
Since 1990, WFPD's calls have increased from 1.4 calls per day to more than 5
calls today-an increase of over 350 percent. The instances of two or more emer-
gency calls occurring at the same time have increased more than 500 percent. In
1990 Windsor's population was 12,000; today it’s nearly 25,000 (30,000 in the Fire
District). WFPD serves a 30.75-square mile area, including part of the Town and
adjacent unincorporated areas. WFPD has only two full-time paid firefighters on
duty during any 24-hour period. While there are hundreds of new homes and con-
dos near the high school and golf course, the downtown fire station is not staffed.
Growth has resulted in more traffic, more signals, more problems getting from one
side of town to the other quickly. WFPD operates debt-free-all revenues service
the community; all assets are owned outright. Since 1986, WFPD has created a
first-class fire department and provided superior service without raising the special
tax.

It’s a matter of economics, pure and simple. WFPD has an excellent record of fiscal
responsibility, but the increasing demand for emergency services is increasing de-
mands on resources to the point where service levels are threatened. Vote to im-
prove response times. Vote for the safety of your family and our community. Vote
Yes!

necessary to reflect the risk associated with the parcel. Upon receipt of the report,
the Board of Directors shall set a date for a public hearing thereon and shall cause
notice of the hearing to be given pursuant to Section VIII of this ordinance. At the
public hearing, the Board of Directors shall set the rate and make such corrections
