IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL
SPRECKELS MEMORIAL DISTRICT
MEASURE D

The Board of Directors of the Spreckels Memorial District has by
resolution ordered a special election to submit to the voters of the
Memorial District a measure to authorize the Memorial District to levy
a special parcel tax for a maximum period of five years commencing
July 1, 1995.

The annual rate of the special parcel tax to be levied is not more
than $95.00 per parcel per year for parcels within the Memorial Dis-
trict, as such parcels appear on the records of the County of Monterey
Assessor’s Office as of March 1st of each year.

Memorial districts are authorized by state law to impose qualified
special taxes on real property within their respective districts upon
approval by a two-thirds vote of the voters voting upon the special tax
measure. The qualified special tax must apply uniformly to all taxpay-
ers or all real property within the memorial district and may not be
an ad valorem tax on real property, a transaction tax, or a sales tax
on the sale of real property.

If the measure is approved by a vote of two-thirds of the voters
voting, the additional revenue raised by the special parcel tax is to
be expended solely for the purpose of maintaining, repairing, and op-
erating all of the District’s property and facilities, including the
Spreckels Memorial Park.

If two-thirds of the voters voting on the measure do not vote for
approval, the measure will fail and the proposed special parcel tax
will not be levied.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE D

Fellow Spreckels Memorial District Residents,

We need your help to maintain Spreckels Memorial Park. Measur(
A, which would have assessed each parcel in the district $100 pe
year, failed. The vote was:

•	yes - 103

•	no - 63

8 votes short of the required 2/3 majority. Starting this fiscal yea
(July 94), we will not have enough income to maintain both th
Spreckels Veterans Memorial Buiiding and the Spreckels Memori;
Park. Our first obligation is the Veterans Memorial Building. If we car
not maintain the park, we must return it to the Sugar Company.
Several residents suggested that we clear up some issues that ma
have led to the failure and place a measure on this ballot. The clar
fications follow:

1.	Type of assessment. A Memorial District can only use a flat rat
per parcel.

2.	Use of the money. The assessment is needed to save Sprecke
Memorial Park. The district was formed under the Military and Veterar
Code to provide a meeting place for veterans and veteran’s organiz
tions - Spreckels Veterans Memorial Building. The park was accept*
later as an added benefit. The revenue remaining after the state a
tions will support the Veterans Memorial Building. We keep detail*
expense records and can show that the assessment goes to pa
maintenance.

3.	Time limit. This is a long term problem, but based on your fee
back, the assessment is limited to five years.

4.	Amount. Our annual loss from the state actions exceeds $51 tho
sand, leaving approximately $90-95 thousand. It costs approximat*
$85 thousand to operate the Veterans Memorial Building without maj
repairs or improvements and $50 thousand for Spreckels Memor
Park. With 374 parcels in the district, a $95 assessment will rai
$35,530, giving us approximately $130 thousand. We hope to rai
the rest through fund raising activities.

Thank You,

si Clarence Freeze
President
