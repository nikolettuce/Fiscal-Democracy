ANALYSIS OF PROPOSITION K

By DeWItt W. Clinton, County Counsel

Approval of this ballot measure would allow the Las Virgenes Unified School
District to impose a special tax upon each parcel of real property located wholly
or partially within the District, effective immediately.

The amount of the tax would initially be $ 1 SO per year, adjusted annually each
year thereafter in accordance with the Consumer Price Index for the Los Ange-
les Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area. The tax would be levied each year
for a maximum of 4 years.

Taxpayers 65 years of age or older who own and occupy single family residen-
tial parcels may, upon application to the Board of Education, be granted an
exemption from the special tax. Taxpayers who own and occupy contiguous
parcels used for single family residential purposes may, upon application to
the Board of Education, have such parcels treated as a single parcel for pur-
poses of the special tax.

The special tax would be used to restore budget cuts, reduce class size, lower
pupil to teacher ratios, add a seventh period at the middle school, and hire
elementary specialists in such areas as music, art, computers and physical
education.

The approval of the measure would also allow the District to increase the legal
ceiling on expenditures currently imposed by the State Constitution, in an
amount equal to the tax collected each year. This increase in the ceiling is lim-
ited to four (4) years, without additional voter approval.

A two-thirds (2/3) vote is required for passage of the measure.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION K

Our community and children have reaped the benefits of a nationally recog-
nized school system. People move here because of our schools. Property values
are higher because of our schools. Diminished state funding places us at a cross-
roads. We can take back local control to reverse the erosion of Las Virgenes
schools. Or, we can do nothing and accept the mediocrity that is evident else-
where thereby jeopardizing our children and our property values.

Proposition K. will place a LIMITED TERM parcel tax on every parcel in our
District It will cost 41 cents a day ($150 annually) per parcel and is equally
applied (additional taxes tied to property value are prohibited by Proposition
13). It will provide over $3 million directly to oar children.

What can Proposition K provide for Las Virgenes Schools?

-SMALLER CLASSES (California has the second largest class sizes in the
nation. Due to recent cutbacks many classes approach 40 per class!)

-MORE CLASSES (It will restore elective classes at the Middle and High
School level.)

-ELEMENTARY SPECIALISTS (Proposition K. will provide regular
instruction in areas such as music, art, P.E. and/or computer to our Elemen-
tary students.)

-INCREASED DESIRABILITY for our schools thereby further enhancing
our property values.

PROPOSITION K

WILL NOT

Raise salaries.

Pay for administrators or increase bureaucracy.

Tax senior citizens.

Go to the state. It stays in Las Virgenes schools or it cannot be
collected.

WILL NOT Last forever - only 4 years. If we cannot deliver on our promises,
you can end the tax.

Argument in Favor of Proposition K (Continued)

Almost eighty percent of our funding “comes from Sacramento,” frequently
with strings attached. Proposition K. will put us back on the road to local con-
trol. It allows us to decide how to spend our educational funds. Please vote
YES on K Tor Kids.
