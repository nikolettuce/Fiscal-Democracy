Said tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city, which is extinguished only

B.	The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the
rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be
paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient's ceasing to

tax administrator may require that such tax be paid directly to the tax administrator.

SECTION 2. Amendment of Administrative Provisions.

Nothing contained in this ordinance or the general laws of the state shall be
construed to prevent the Roseville City Council from amending or repealing in whole
or in part, at any time in the future, without requiring a vote of the people, the
provisions of Chapter 4.24 of the Roseville Municipal Code (“Transient Occupancy
Tax”) in any respect other than an increase in the amount of the tax.

SECTION 3. Severability.

If any part, provision, section, paragraph, clause or word of this ordinance shall
be finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction thereof to be invalid, the
remainder of this ordinance shall not be affected thereby but shall be severed and given

the voters voting for and against it at the general municipal election on November 5,
