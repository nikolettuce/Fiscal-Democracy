Municipal Code

Title 3, Business Regulations
Chapter 15, Transient Occupancy Tax

3-15-3: Tax Imposed

For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to and shall pay a tax
in the amount of nine percent (11%) of the rent charged by the operator. Said tax
constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city which is extinguished only by payment
to the operator or to the city. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at
the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax
shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient's
ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid by the
operator of the hotel, the director of finance may require that such tax shall be paid
directly to the director of finance. (Ord. 343, 12-15-1987; amd. per correspondence dated
