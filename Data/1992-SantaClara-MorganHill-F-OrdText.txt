ORDINANCE NO. 1064, N.S.

AN URGENCY ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF MORGAN HILL
RESCINDING THE UTILITY USERS TAX.

Whereas, the City Council has previously enacted a Utility Users Tax by
Ordinance Numbers 1015, N.S. and 1037, N.S. which presently appear as Chapters 3.52
and 3.53 of the Morgan Hill Municipal Code; and

Whereas, in response to concerns expressed by members of the community about
the continuation of said tax without a vote of the people, the City Council has
determined to rescind said tax; and

Whereas, the public welfare will be served by an immediate action of the Council
rescinding the tax as the date for requesting the issue of its continuation to be placed
before the voters at a special election to be combined with the statewide primary
election to be held on June 2, 1992, expires on March 6, 1992.

Now, therefore, the City Council of the City of Morgan Hill does hereby ordain
as follows:

Section 1. Repeal of Tax. Chapters 3.52 and 3.53 of the Morgan Hill Municipal
Code are hereby repealed and rescinded.

Section 2. Effective/Operative Date. This ordinance shall be effective upon
adoption, but shall be operative on January 1, 1993, unless at an election to be
conducted on June 2, 1992, a majority of votes are cast in favor of the following
question:

Shall the City continue a nine percent (9%) Utility Users Tax, to
pay for essential municipal services, beyond December 31, 1992?

Section 3. Findings of Urgency. The foregoing ordinance is an urgency measure
based upon the following findings as well as the above recitals. The City Council finds
that the public health, safety and welfare will be served by adoption of this ordinance
as an urgency measure in order that the issue of continuation of the Utility Users Tax
may be placed before the public at a special election combined with the June 2, 1992
statewide primary election in order to end uncertainty and divisiveness concerning the
issue of a public vote in connection with the continued existence of said Utility Users
Tax.
