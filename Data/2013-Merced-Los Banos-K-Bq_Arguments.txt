To maintain the number of local police officers/firefighters/E-M-Ts, anti-gang/crime units, and 9-1-1 emergency response times shall Los Banos voters extend Measure A for no more than 7 years to address local public safety needs and protect/maintain police officer and firefighter positions, with citizens oversight, independent annual audits, keeping all funds exclusively for Los Banos without raising taxes?[i][3]

Supporters

•	Police Chief Gary Brizzee

•	Fire Chief Chet Guintini

•	City Manager Steve Carrigan[2]

Arguments in favor

City officials argued that, without funds from the sales tax authorized for spending by
Measure K, the city may not be able to afford the salaries of all 36 sworn officers and 14
paid firefighters.[2]

Police Chief Gary Brizzee said, “There are over 600 documented gang members and
associates in Los Banos, and there are over 18 active criminal gangs. Crime is
increasing in the neighborhoods. We’ve heard through some of the major federal
investigations where people are specifically coming to Los Banos so they can hide out.
We know it to be true because we’ve heard it from the gang members’ mouths.”

Fire Chief Guintini said, “Keeping paid staff is getting that first and second company
right now. We need to look at the whole picture. If we were to lose that funding, all that
personnel would have to go back to the general fund.”[2]

Opposition

Baldo Salcido accused city officials of using scare tactics.

Salcido said, “It (Measure K) is not necessary. They want you to think that if it doesn’t
pass, we’ll lose six police officers. The general fund pays those salaries, and there’s a
$6 million surplus.”
