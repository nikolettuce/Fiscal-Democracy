MEASURE“M”
IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

A majority “yes” vote would enact Measure “M”.

Measure “M” would increase Hesperia’s transient occupancy tax (“TOT”) from 7% to
10%. The TOT, commonly referred to as a “bed tax” is imposed upon travelers who
spend the night at a Hotel/Motel in the city, and is intended to compensate the city for
the drain on resources that Hotel/Motel occupants create. The Hotel/Motel operator
collects the TOT for the city and remits the amount collected to the city on a regular
basis. The TOT is classified as a “General Tax”. Consequently, under State
Proposition 218, any increase in the TOT must be approved by a majority of the city’s
voters voting at a general election. Revenue derived from the TOT is deposited in the
city’s general fund and may be used for general municipal purposes; such as: Public
Safety Services and other public services, as well as construction and maintenance of
city property, including buildings, streets, parks and other city works of improvement.

Existing Law

The city’s TOT is presently imposed at the rate of 7% of the rent charged by the
Hotel/Motel operator.

Effect Measure “M” on Existing Law

Measure “M”, if approved by a majority of the city’s voters voting at the November 7,
2006 general election, will increase the TOT rate from 7% to 10%. If Measure “M” is
not approved, the TOT will remain at 7%.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure “M”. If you desire a copy of
the Measure, please call the City Clerk’s office at: 760.947.1027 and a copy will be
mailed to you at no cost to you.

MEASURE“M”
ARGUMENT IN FAVOR

A “Yes” vote on Measure “M” will not raise the taxes of the residents in Hesperia. It is
only paid by visitors staying in hotels and motels in the City.

A “Yes” vote on Measure “M” does generate additional funding that will be used to
provide public safety services, pave roads, and fund other City services.

We urge you to VOTE YES to raise the City’s Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) from
the current rate of 7% to 10%. TOT is a charge placed on hotel and motel bills paid by
guests. The TOT ensures that the guests of hotels and motels help pay for City
services that they use and benefit from while staying in Hesperia.

By increasing the TOT, additional funds will be generated to help pay for vital services
such as police protection, street improvements, and other City services. These
services help protect and improve our quality of life. Voting YES means that the new
tax rate would generate approximately $300,000 in additional revenue to help fund
these vital services.

The 10% TOT rate is recommended because it is the most commonly charged TOT
tax rate in the State as well as San Bernardino County.

Measure “M” helps Hesperia residents get more without paying more.

Please join us in voting “Yes” for Measure “M” to enhance the level of the City
services that benefit you.
