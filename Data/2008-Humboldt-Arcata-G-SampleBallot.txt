MEASUREG
IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY

A Measure to Approve a Transactions and Use Sales Tax
In the City of Areata

If approved by a majority of the voters, Measure G would authorize
an additional three-quarter percent (% %) transactions and use sales
tax to be levied within the City of Areata. This tax would be a general
purpose tax, and all revenue raised from the tax would go into the
City’s general fund to be used for any municipal governmental
purpose. Municipal governmental purposes include public works and
police protection services identified in the ballot measure, and may
include other governmental functions and services. The Measure
would not bind the City to use the tax revenue for any particular
services, facilities, or programs.

The % % sales tax would be levied in addition to the current sales
tax and would be collected at the same time and in the same manner
as the existing sales tax. Currently the sales tax in Areata (including
State and local taxes) is 7%%. If this Measure is approved, the sales
tax in the City of Areata would be 8%. The increased tax is estimated
to generate approximately $1,500,000 per year.

Measure G contains fiscal accountability provisions, which include
the creation by the City Council of a citizens’ oversight committee
to annually review the City’s expenditure of revenues generated by
the tax. The composition of the oversight committee and its specific
duties would be established by the City Council.

If approved by a majority of the voters at the November 4, 2008
election, the %% sales tax would become operative on April 1,2009
and would terminate 20 years after its approval.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE “G”

A YES vote is a Community Working Together to invest in Arcata’s
future to fund critical and essential community services to make
Areata a better and safer place to live.

These additional sales tax revenues are important to the City of
Areata when you consider that just a fraction of a penny on the
dollar will support:

•	Filling potholes, maintaining, and repairing city streets,

•	Increasing police staffing to improve downtown, Plaza, Valley
West, city forest, and park safety,

•	Improving pedestrian and bicycle safety,

•	Enhancing community and neighborhood safety,

•	Providing safer sidewalks, pathways to schools, bicycle lanes
and wheelchair access,

Consistent with Arcata’s small town values, a Citizens’ Oversight
Committee will be established to conduct annual audits of all
expenditures to ensure fiscal accountability and public participation.

State Government continues to take money from cities and counties
to fund State programs and budget deficits. The proposed Sales Tax
is the one way the City is able to replace those lost revenues to
fund many of our essential services.

Please help keep Areata a vibrant, safe and healthy place to live,
work and raise our families. Vote YES on Measure “G.”
