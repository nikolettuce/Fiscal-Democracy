COUNTY COUNSEL'S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
OF MEASURE 0

A school district may levy a special tax upon approval by two-thirds of the
votes cast on a measure pursuant to section 4 of article XIIIA of the
California Constitution and sections 50075 et seq. of the California
Government Code.

The Board of Trustees (Board) for Alum Rock Union School District
(District) proposes Measure 0, renewing an existing parcel tax that
expires on June 30,2015, to continue to be levied at $176.42 per parcel
per year, adjusted annually by changes to the San Jose Statistical Area
Consumer Price Index, for an additional seven years beyond the current
expiration of June 30, 2015. If approved, the renewed parcel tax will
commence on July 1,2015 and expire on June 30,2022.

State law requires the District to state the specific purposes for which the
tax proceeds will be used and only spend the proceeds of the tax for
these purposes. The stated purposes of the tax proposed by Measure O
are to: (1) maintain reading, writing, math, science, technology and art
programs; (2) extend student support; (3) keep school libraries open; and
(4) attract and retain teachers and school counselors. Revenue
generated by Measure O will not be used for District administrators'
salaries or benefits.

The District is required by law to provide additional accountability
measures for the proceeds. These measures include: (1) depositing the
proceeds into a fund that is separate and apart from other District funds;
and (2) providing an annual written report to the Board detailing the
amount of funds collected and expended and the status of any project
authorized to be funded from the tax proceeds. The Board will maintain
its existing oversight committee to oversee the expenditure of parcel tax
revenue.

Measure O was placed on the ballot by the Board.

A "yes" vote is a vote to approve a parcel tax of $176.42, as adjusted
annually by changes to the San Jose Statistical Area Consumer Price
Index, per parcel on parcels within the District for seven years
commencing on July 1,2015.

A "no" vote is a vote to not approve a parcel tax of $176.42, as adjusted
annually by changes to the San Jose Statistical Area Consumer Price
Index, per parcel on parcels within the District for seven years
commencing on July 1,2015.

In 2008, voters approved Alum Rock Union Elementary School District's
$179,000,000 bond measure.

Two years later, in 2010, Alum Rock Union Elementary School District
got a $160.16 per parcel tax, which has since risen to $176.42, to
"preserve quality education" and "maintaining small class sizes."

Then just 2 short years ago, voters approved another $125.000.000 loan
to fund school improvements.

Now they're back, once again, asking for our approval to extend that 2010
parcel tax for another 7 years. The District always makes the same
pleas to try to scare us into voting for more debt and higher taxes.

This time we should tell them NO.

Alum Rock Union Elementary School District has steadily declining
enrollment. Since the 2011-12 school year, they have dropped by 371
students.

With enrollment declining, presumably they need fewer teachers and
fewer classrooms. Why would they need a tax extension?

Have they put to good use the parcel taxes and loans they've already
received? Let's look at their students' academic proficiency (2012-
13):

	District  average	Statewide STAR average	Comparison
English	49.6%	55%	-5%
Math	57.3%	50%	+ 7%
Science	53%	59%	-6%
History	41%	49%	-8%

(Source: Education Data Partnership, www.Ed-Data.k12.ca.us.)

Alum Rock Union Elementary School District's students are below the
state average in 3/4 of the subjects! The only bright spot—if you can
call it that—is Math, in which, still, only 57.3% of students meet or exceed
proficiency standards.

Please don't reward failure with your hard-earned money. Demand
better academic results, and only then reward the District for their
efforts.

Please vote NO on Measure O.

Like us, you can be for schools, for students, for teachers, and
against Measure O.

ALUM ROCK UNION ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT
Quality Education Parcel Tax Measure O

INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE

To provide local reliable funding for local schools that cannot be
taken by the State, to maintain strong innovative core academic programs
in reading, writing, math, science, technology and the arts, attract and
retain highly qualified and experienced teachers and school counselors,
maintain libraries, and extend student support, with no proceeds used for
administrative salaries and benefits, the Alum Rock Union Elementary
School District ("District") proposes to renew and extend its existing
quality education parcel tax, without increasing the current tax rate, for a
period of seven years from its current expiration date (June 30, 2015),
starting on July 1, 2015 at a rate of $176.42, as annually adjusted by
changes in the San Jose Statistical Area Consumer Price Index, per
parcel per year, and to implement strict accountability measures, to
ensure the funds are used to:

•	Maintain innovative reading, writing, math, science, technology
and arts programs;

•	Extend student support;

•	Keep school libraries open; and

•	Attract and retain highly qualified and experienced teachers
and school counselors.

The proceeds of the parcel tax shall be deposited into a separate
account created by the District.

DEFINITION OF "PARCEL”

For purposes of the core academic programs parcel tax, the term
"Parcel" means any parcel of land which lies wholly or partially within the
boundaries of the Alum Rock Union Elementary School District, that
receives a separate tax bill for ad valorem property taxes from the Santa
Clara County Assessor/Tax Collector. All property that is otherwise
exempt from or upon which are levied no ad valorem property taxes in
any year shall also be exempt from the quality education parcel tax in
such year.

REDUCTION IN TAX IF RESULT IS LESS OTHER GOVERNMENT
SUPPORT

The collection of the quality education parcel tax is not intended to
decrease or offset any increase in local, state or federal government
revenue sources that would otherwise be available to the District during
the period of the parcel tax. In the event that the levy and collection does
have such an effect, the District may cease the levy or shall reduce the
parcel tax to the extent that such action would restore the amount of the
decrease or offset in other revenues.

ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES

In accordance with the requirements of California Government Code
Sections 50075.1 and 50075.3, the following accountability measures,
among others, shall apply to the parcel tax levied in accordance with this

purposes identified above; (b) the proceeds of the parcel tax shall be
applied only to those specific purposes identified above; (c) a separate,
special account shall be created into which the proceeds of the quality
education parcel tax must be deposited; and (d) an annual written report
shall be made to the Board of Trustees of the District showing (i) the
amount of funds collected and expended from the proceeds of the quality
education parcel tax and (ii) the status of any projects or programs
required or authorized to be funded from the proceeds of the quality
education parcel tax, as identified above. In addition, the District will
maintain its existing Citizens' Oversight Committee which will provide
oversight as to the expenditure of parcel tax revenues.
