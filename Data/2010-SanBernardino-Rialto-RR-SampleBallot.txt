IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
BY CITY ATTORNEY

Voters of the City of Rialto approved participation in the statewide Public Employees’
Retirement System (“PERS”) for its employees, at an election on April 8, 1958. The
City then executed a contract with PERS on July 16, 1958, committing itself to such
participation, which included the requirement for an annual formula based retirement
fund contribution to PERS. On September 15, 1958, the City Council adopted
Ordinance No. 414 fixing a special ad valorem tax on real property to pay that
contribution (“the 1958 tax”), and continued to do so each year thereafter until 2003,
when it reduced the tax rate zero on the assumption that the City would be able to
locate an alternative source of funding.

However, these previously identified alternative sources of funding now have been
curtailed or eliminated by a severe reduction in State funding for cities and also a
substantial reduction in other City revenues by adverse economic conditions, which
has created a severe deficit in the current and prospective City budgets.

The City still is legally required to make these annual contributions to PERS to
continue the funding of its employee retirement program. However, if the amount of
the special tax to fund that obligation is not restored to at least its maximum legally
permissible amount, all of that obligation must be funded by a reduction in the amount
of City revenues available for other essential City services, including fundamental
services such as public safety.

The maximum permissible amount of this tax now legally is limited to the City FY
1982/1983 special tax rate of $0.1506 per $100 of assessed value of real property.
However, even if the City Council restores the 1958 tax to that limited amount this will
provide only approximately $4,534,000 of the City funding for its currently required
PERS contribution for Fiscal Year 2009-2010 of approximately $10,000,000. This will
leave an annual funding deficiency for such contribution of approximately $5,466,000.
In addition, in the fiscal year 2011-2012, the amount of such annual contributions will
increase further by approximately $11 million, which will result in an increased annual
funding deficiency of approximately $8,000,000.

This measure is advisory only, to get an indication of general voter opinion, and will
not require the City Council to increase the amount of the 1958 tax, although it would
have the legal authority to do so pursuant to other applicable provisions of law without
regard to the results of this advisory ballot measure.
