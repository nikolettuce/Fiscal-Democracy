IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF
MEASURE G

This measure is intended to provide an annual
source of funding for the Modoc Area Recreation
and Parks District (“District”) approved by the voters
as Measure E on the March 2005 Special Election
ballot. If this Measure is passed by two-thirds vote,
the District will assess a $25.00 per year special
tax on each property owner owning property within
the new District. If Measure G is not passed, it is
doubtful the District will be able to proceed with its
proposed aquatic center or have sufficient funding
to operate. In the event the District has insufficient
funding, it could be subject to being dissolved. This
Measure approves a $25.00 per year assessment.
Any increase in assessment would require a new
vote of the registered voters within the District.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF
MEASURE G

Property owners in the Modoc Parks &
Recreation District will not pay more than $25 per
year, regardless of the number of properties owned.
The assessment will allow the Modoc Parks &
Recreation District to construct and maintain the
Modoc Aquatic and Recreation Center. Property
owners who pay the $25 per year will receive a $25
credit to use at the Modoc Aquatic & Recreation
Center. This center will increase the health, wellness
and recreation choices available to Modoc County
citizens, from children to seniors. As a community
facility, the center will be owned and operated by
the citizens of Modoc County through the Modoc
Parks and Recreation District.

The Modoc Aquatic & Recreation Center
will provide year-round access to physical fitness,
aquatic/physical therapy and recreation activities,
as well as community gatherings and functions. The
center will have an indoor heated 25-meter pool,
a wading pool, locker rooms, and reception area
with a snack bar, full-size gym, and walking track.
A weight room, exercise/meeting room, racquetball
court and a Jacuzzi/sauna room will be added as
funding becomes available. The facility will be open
year-round, seven days a week, except holidays.

Benefits include an increase in:

Economic development

Senior health and wellness programs

Aquatic rehabilitation

Mentoring - adult/child and youth/child

Health and fitness for all

Sense of Community
