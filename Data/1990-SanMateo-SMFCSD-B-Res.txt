Mr. James A. Rossetto, Clerk
Mrs. Melodie L. Lew, Trustee

Absent:	Mr.	Jack E. Coyne, Jr., Vice President

Mr. Dwight W. Clark, Trustee

In addition to staff, Mr. David Casnocha of Brown & Wood was
present.

5.0	APPROVAL OF THE AGENDA

Mr. Rossetto moved, seconded by Mrs. Lew, and carried 4-0-0, that
the Board approve the agenda for July 5, 1990.

9.0	COMMUNICATION

Mrs. Stimson opened the Public Hearing on Parcel Tax Resolution No.
26/89-90 at 5:18 p.m. There was no one wishing to speak, and the
Public Hearing was closed.

10.0	ADMINISTRATION

10.1	Dr. Damelio explained the body of the resolution showed what
program areas the District intends to address if the parcel tax
passes. It is estimated there are 35,000 parcels in the school
district. The tax per parcel would be $55 per year with persons
who are aged 65 or over permitted to apply for an exemption. Data
indicates that approximately one-half of the eligible seniors would
apply for the exemption.

In response to a question from Mrs. Lew, Dr. Damelio indicated that
the parcel tax would apply to all parcels whether residential,
business, condominiums, etc.

Mrs. Stimson read aloud from Resolution No. 26/89-90 the exact
wording as it would appear on the ballot.

Mr. Rossetto asked that action on Item 10.1 be suspended as he
would like to determine the cost to the taxpayer if the General
Obligation Bond was passed.

The average cost per taxpayer would be approximately $13 per year,
Dr. Damelio indicated. Bond money can only be used for capital
improvements but the interest earned while the bond money is in
the bank can be used for other things.

Referring to Resolution No. 26/89-90, Ms. Busselle and Mr. Casnocha
suggested that the wording in Section 2 be changed to conform to
the wording in Section 4 regarding senior exemption.

There was considerable discussion regarding the issue of reducing
class size and the need to address this matter thoroughly during
the campaign in order to convince the voters of its importance.

Mr. Rossetto moved that the Board of Trustees adopt Parcel Tax
Resolution No. 26/89-90 with the language provided in Section 2
being reworded to match that regarding senior exemption in Section
4.

Mrs. Lew seconded the motion and it was carried 3-0-0.

10.2	"Exhibit A", the attachment to Resolution No. 27/89-90, was
read since it was the language that would appear on the ballot.
Ms. Busselle and Mr. Casnocha responded to questions and comments
from Board members regarding the life of the bond, how taxpayers
would know what their tax would be, etc. There would be no senior
exemption for the bond.

Dr. Damelio mentioned the editorial in today's Times regarding the
proposed tax election which was very positive but stated that
parents needed to get out and work for the election to be
successful.

There was discussion among Board members and staff regarding what
the next steps would be after the Board's action this evening, what
the estimated cost of the election would be for the District, etc.

In response to a question by Mrs. Lew, Dr. Damelio gave some
examples of what was meant by acquiring sites and facilities as
stated in the ballot language. There was further discussion
regarding the ballot language and possible rewording therein.

The possibility of including the word "elementary" in the ballot
language so as to differentiate from the high school district was
another item for discussion.

Mr. Rossetto moved that the Board of Trustees adopt General
Obligation Bond Resolution No. 27/89-90 with the rewording of the
ballot language as discussed and with the inclusion of (elementary)
following City in the title of the school district after
verification with appropriate counsel to see if this can be done.

MrS. Lew seconded the motion, and it was carried 3-0-0.

Mr. Rossetto moved, seconded by Mrs. Lew, and carried 3-0-0, that
the Board of Trustees amend Resolution No. 26/89-90 to include
(elementary) in the name of the school district following City
subject to change as appropriate after advice of legal counsel.

There was no need for a closed session, Mrs. Stimson announced, and
the meeting was adjourned at 6:25 p.m.

MEASURE 8

“Shall the Son Mateo City (elementary) School District, for the benefit of students in San Mateo and Foster City, be authorized to
impose a qualified special tax (a) to reduce class size; (b) to upgrade library materials and equipment; (c) to improve the an and
music programs: (d) to improve the physical education program; and (e) to acquire classroom equipment at the rate of $55 per year
per parcel of land (with exemptions for parcels owned and occupied by a person 65 years of age or older, upon application, and
certain other property exempted by law) and. in connection therewith, shall the appropriations limit of the District be raised each
year in an amount equal to the levy of said tax for said year?"

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS MEASURE B

Section 4 of article XIIIA of the California Constitution and Gov-
ernment Code section 50079. et scq.. authorize a school district, upon
approval of two-chirds of the voting electorate, to levy a qualified special
tax for specified purposes.

By this measure, the Board of Trustees of the San Mateo City
School District proposes to levy a qualified special tax. This tax shall
be in an amount not to exceed S55.Q0 per year assessed against each
parcel of taxable land in the District. A parcel shall be defined as any
unit of land in the District which now receives a separate tax bill from
the San Mateo County Assessor's Office. Upon application, an exemp-
tion will be granted for parcels owned and occupied by a person 65
years or older. All property which would otherwise be exempt from
property taxes will also be exempt from the imposition of the special tax.

In connection with the proposal of the special tax. this measure
would also increase the District's appropriations limit per fiscal year,
in an amount equal to the levy of special taxes for that year, as permitted
by article XIIIB. section 4 of the California Constitution.

The Board of Trustees has listed the specific purposes of the tax
as (a) to reduce class size; fb) to upgrade library materials and equipment:
(c) to improve the an and music programs; (d) to improve the physical
education program; and (e) to acquire classroom equipment.

A "yes” vote on this measure would allow a special tax
to be levied on property within die boundaries of the San
Mateo City School District at an amount not to exceed
$55.00 per parcel. It would also allow the appropriations
(spending) limit of the District to be raised each year in
an amount equal to the levy of the tax for that year.

A "no" vote on this measure would not allow the special
tax to be levied and it would not allow the appropriations
limit to be raised.

The measure passes if two-thirds of those voting on the measure
vote "yes."

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE B

The San Mateo City Elementary School District needs your support
for Measure 8 to reduce class size and improve libraries and classroom
programs in elementary and middle schools in San Mateo and Foster
City.

The facts are:

*	Class size in the San Mateo City Elementary District is higher than
in neighboring districts.

*	Our library budget is inadequate. The average book in our library
is more than 10 years old. Ourlibraries cannot support the programs
our students need to prepare for the competitive world of the future.

“ Funds are not available in die existing budget to reduce class size
and to improve classroom and library* programs.

Passage of Measure B will provide funds annually:

*	to reduce class size.

*	to provide library books and instructional equipment.

*	to improve classroom instructional programs including music, arts,
and physical education.

Passage of Measure B cannot do the job alone.

*	Passage of Measure B will raise funds to reduce class size and
improve our instructional program. It is essential, however, that
Measure C also pass. Measure C will raise the funds needed to
rehabilitate our classrooms. Without adequate classrooms, we can-
not reduce class size.

These are the facts. Help reduce class size, improve libraries and im-
prove classroom programs. Good schools mean good communities.
Vote yes on Measure B.

The cost is reasonable. Passage of Measure B will cost homeowners
in our community S55 per year (that's less than S4.60 per month). A
full exemption from this cost is available for senior citizens.

Vote Yes on Measure B.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE C

The San Maico Cay Elemenury School District needs your support
for Measure C to rehabilitate tlx classrooms and libraries in the elemen-
tary and middle schools in San Mateo and Foster City.

The facts are:

*	The classrooms and libraries in our school district are old. Twelve
of our schools are more than 30 years old.

*	Our schools face an immediate need to fix leaking roofs, to remove
asbestos and make other essential repairs.

*	If additional local funds are not approved, the rehabilitation needs
. of our schools will make it impossible for the Districts to reduce

class size..

Passage of Measure C will provide the funds needed to:

*	rehabilitate and improve existing classrooms and other school
facilities.

■ improve school libraries and library equipment,

*	improve health and safety conditions in our schools.

Passage of Measure C cannot do the job alone.

*	Passage of Measure C will raise funds to rehabilitate the classrooms
we have, (t is essential, however, that Measure B also pass. Meas-
ure B will raise the funds needed to reduce class sizes inside those
rehabilitated classrooms.

These are the facts. Help rehabilitate the classrooms and libraries in
our school district. Good schools mean good communities. Vote yes
on Measure C.

The cost is reasonable. Passage of Measure C will cost homeowners
in our community S 12.44 per year — less ‘than Si .05 per month.

Vote Yes on Measure C.
