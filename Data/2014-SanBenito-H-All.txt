RESOLUTION NO. 2014- btf

A RESOLUTION OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OF SAN BENITO
COUNTY TO PLACE A MEASURE ON THE NOVEMBER 4,2014 BALLOT TO
RENEW FEES PURSUANT TO VEHICLE CODE SECTIONS 9250.7 AND 22710
(ABANDONED VEHICLE ABATEMENT PROGRAM)

WHEREAS, the Sections 9250.7 and 22710 of the California Vehicle Code
authorized the establishment of the San Benito County Abandoned Vehicle Abatement
Program (“AVA”) for the abatement of abandoned vehicles and further authorized the
imposition of a one ($ 1.00) vehicle registration fee on vehicles registered in San Benito
County when approved by the Board of Supervisors and a majority of cities having a
majority of the incorporated population (referred to as the “AVA Fee”); and,

WHEREAS, in 1991, the San Benito County Board of Supervisors established
the Service Authority, including the cities of Hollister and San Juan Bautista, for this
program by the adoption of Resolution 91-89; and,

WHEREAS, the registration fees are used exclusively for the abatement,
removal, and disposal of any abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or inoperative vehicles or
vehicle parts as public nuisances, on private or public property, to combat neighborhood
blight and decay; and,

WHEREAS, the Abandoned Vehicle Abatement Program has contributed
approximately $1,000,000 for the abatement of abandoned vehicles within San Benito
County since 1991; and,

WHEREAS, the AVA Program has allowed for the abatement of approximately
6,000 abandoned vehicles and/or parts thereof since its establishment in 1991; and,

WHEREAS, the Abandoned Vehicle Abatement Program is essential to
reducing crime, maintaining property values, reducing blight and the physical and
aesthetic deterioration of our community; and,

WHEREAS, without continuing the AVA Program, the County will be unable to
recover a significant portion of the costs of abating nuisance vehicles; and,

WHEREAS, California Vehicle Code Section 9250.7(h) allows each California
County to extend their sunset date for the program in 10-year increments with a two-
thirds vote of the Board of Supervisors and approval of a majority of the cities with the
majority of the incorporated population; and,

WHEREAS, Proposition 26, adopted by the voters of California in 2010, altered
the definition of a fee and resulted in the classification of the AVA fee as a special tax
subject to voter approval by a two-thirds vote of the voters voting in an election on the
issue; and,

WHEREAS, without voter approval, the current AVA fee will be suspended or
terminated, and the County will be unable to recover a significant portion of the costs of
abating nuisance vehicles; and,

WHEREAS, the next available countywide ballot opportunity is the November 4,
2014 primary election.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the San Benito County Board of
Supervisors as follows:

and 22710, or any successor statutes thereto, for the purposes of removal and disposal of

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE H BY THE
SAN BENITO COUNTY COUNSEL’S OFFICE

This analysis of the renewal of the abandoned vehicle abatement program fee, Measure H, is
prepared and submitted in accordance with Elections Code Section 9160. This measure was
placed on the ballot by a vote of the San Benito County Board of Supervisors.

Sections 22710 and 9250.7 of the California Vehicle Code authorize the establishment of the San
Benito County Abandoned Vehicle Authority (AVA), as well as the imposition of a fee on all
registered vehicles, except for those vehicles which, are exempt from the payment of registration
fees. The fee, which is referred to as the AVA fee, is charged at a rate of one ($1.00) dollar for
every vehicle registered to an owner with an address in the County, and an additional ($2.00)
dollars on commercial vehicles weighing 10,001 pounds or more.

The AVA Fees are collected by the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and then
dispersed to the San Benito County Abandoned Vehicle Authority. The fees may only be used
for the abatement, removal, and disposal of any abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or inoperative
vehicles, or vehicle parts located on public or private property within San Benito County. The
AVA Fee must be renewed every ten (10) years by a vote of the electors.

A YES vote would authorize the DMV to continue collecting the AVA Fee in the amount of one
($1.00) dollar for every vehicle registered in San Benito County, and an additional ($2.00)
dollars for certain commercial vehicles registered in San Benito County for a term of ten (10)
years for the purpose of removal and disposal of abandoned and wrecked vehicles. The
authorization of the AVA fee granted by this measure would end on November 4,2024.

A NO vote would mean that the DMV would not collect the AVA Fee.

The AVA Fee will not be renewed, and the AVA Fee will cease being collected, unless the
measure is approved by two-thirds (2/3) of the registered voters voting on Measure H.

This measure authorizes the imposition of a $1 Vehicle Abandonment Abatement Fee
for a 10-year period. Since 1991, this fee has been collected by the Department of
Motor Vehicles on vehicles registered to addresses in the County. The Abatement
Fees received by the County provides most, but not all, of the revenues associated
with the Code Enforcement and Nuisance Abatement Division.

Based on current annual fee collections and historical patterns of growth and declines
in vehicle registrations, the Auditor-Controller estimates the total average Vehicle
Abandonment Abatement Fees collected annually under this measure is
approximately $56,000.

The revenues from this measure shall be restricted to expenditures associated with the
enforcement of ordinances and codes that abate abandoned vehicles and other
nuisances that protect the health, safety, and welfare of the general public.

In accordance with the Election Code, the scope of this fiscal impact analysis has been
limited to the measure's effect on revenues and expenditures. It does not address
larger countywide fiscal issues such as the measure's effect on the overall County
economy.

Argument in Favor of Measure “M

^OERftUlGOl

BY

Voting Yes on Measure ______will not create a new fee but will continue the same fee tffi

been collected since 1991 for an additional ten-year period. The San Benito County Abandoned
Vehicle Abatement program provides residents with a program that is responsive to complaints
and results in proper removal of abandoned vehicles. Since 1991, the $ 1 fee per vehicle and $2
fee for certain commercial vehicles has been collected on vehicle registrations and has resulted in
the removal of approximately 6,000 abandoned vehicles. During this same time period
approximately SI,000,000 has been generated through the local fee to help fund the vehicle
removal, program administration and reporting requirements. If approved at this election, the fee
will terminate in November 2024 unless further authorized by the voters. Not approving
Measure M will result in the loss of approximately $54,000 in annual revenue which the
Abandoned Vehicle Abatement program relies upon.

Voting Yes on Measure will continue an important local program for all residents of San
Benito County, including the cities of San Juan Bautista and Hollister. Removal of abandoned
vehicles, through the continuation of the Abandoned Vehicle Abatement program, provides a
necessary local service by reducing risk to the environment, removing safety hazards, and
maintaining the visual beauty of our community. Risks to the environment include fluids leaking
or rust leaching from abandoned vehicles that can enter waterways or habitats through drainage
systems. Vehicles abandoned in roadways present safety hazards by occupying a portion of a
roadway or shoulder. Abandoned vehicles are also an eyesore.
