ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE N

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PARADISE RANCH
ESTATES EMERGENCY ROAD REPAIRS &
ROADSIDE BRUSH CLEARING

Last winter’s storms seriously damaged and destroyed
parts of our private road system. We urgently need to pay
for critical repairs, remove brush from road edges to
reduce fire hazards and improve driving sight lines. Funds
are also needed to improve the quality of our road mainte-
nance and to increase our reserves to better remedy emer-
gencies and road hazards.

This measure, which requires a 2/3rds majority vote to
pass, proposes a $275 parcel tax in 2007, then reduces to
$185 annually through 2016. While the County does allot
about $25,000 from annual tax revenues for our use in rou-
tine road maintenance, these funds provide only limited
ability to cope with most emergencies and extraordinary
repairs.

The proposed revenues will be used for:

I.	One-Time Emergency Storm Repairs - $27,525 for
Lower & Upper Robert, Dover, Sunnyside, Eliza-
beth, Buck Point and Douglas Drive.

II.	Roadside Fire Prevention & Improved Sight Lines -
$20,000 per year.

Perform annual roadside and emergency turnout brush
clearing and reduce fire hazards and improve driving
safety.

IE. Future Non-routine Repairs & Maintenance -
$12,175 annual average.

This will enhance our effective response to future winter
emergency needs. Any annual funds not used will be
retained in reserve for future emergency road needs.
Drakes View Drive was last paved in 1992 and will need
repaving in 3 to 5 years. The repaving cost is not included
in this measure. It is too soon to accurately estimate how
much this will be.

The road repair and maintenance needs described must be

faced now and cannot be safely deferred. To ensure a safer

road system for all of us, vote yes.
