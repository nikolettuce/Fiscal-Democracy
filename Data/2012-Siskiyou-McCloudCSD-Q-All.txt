MEASUREQ
IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL

McCLOUD COMMUNITY SERVICES DISTRICT
SPECIAL TAX FOR LIBRARY SERVICES

The McCloud Community Services District is proposing a special
tax measure to be submitted to the voters in the McCloud Community
Services District. This measure, if approved by two-thirds (2/3) of the
electors voting on the question, could levy a special tax for the
purposes of funding library services.

The current special tax in the McCloud Community Services District
for library services was adopted in a special election in 1997, setting
a parcel tax in the amount of $8.06 per year to fund library services.
The new tax would increase this amount from $8.06 per parcel per
year to $12.00 per parcel per year. If the new tax is not approved,
the current tax rate would remain in effect.

If the special tax receives the approval of two-thirds (2/3) of the
voters authorized to vote upon the measure, upon certification of the
election, it will become a lien on the applicable properties as of
January 1, 2013, and will initially be billed on the 2013-2014 secured
tax roll.

A “yes” vote is a vote to authorize the special tax. A “no” vote is
a vote against authorizing the special tax.
