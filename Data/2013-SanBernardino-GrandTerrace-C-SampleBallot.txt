MEASURE C
CITY OF GRAND TERRACE

_______________________IMPARTIAL	ANALYSIS	OF	MEASURE	C___________________

This Impartial Analysis of Measure C has been prepared by the City Elections
Official pursuant to section 9280 of the California Elections Code.

The City Council received a financial report that provided a five-year projection
analysis of the City’s financial position. Due to the loss of redevelopment funding, the
report projected that the City would need to severely cut municipal services in order to
budget within the projected revenues over the next five years. On June 25, 2013, the
Grand Terrace City Council adopted a budget for fiscal year 2013-2014. In order to
balance the budget the City Council adopted a budget that included a number of
reductions in the current levels of city services, which were itemized in the budget.
The law enforcement agreement with the Sheriff’s Department was reduced by one
deputy for the full fiscal year. In addition, the budget and budget resolution provide
that if a tax measure is not passed in November the following additional reductions will
be instituted: the elimination of an additional Sheriff’s Deputy commencing December
1, 2013; and commencing on January 1, 2014 the funding for the Senior Center will be
eliminated; Rollins and Pico Parks will be closed; there will be a 50% reduction in
emergency operations oversight funding; a reduction in both the City Attorney and
Finance consultant contracts; a reduction in city administration personnel-related
expenses by $266,000 (the current employee level in City Hall is 12.5 positions); a
50% reduction in Historical and Cultural Activities Committee funding; Council and
Oversight Board meetings will be reduced to one per month; and the Planning
Commission will be disbanded. The five-year projection indicated that further
reductions would be necessary in the following fiscal years.

If Measure C is approved by a simple majority of the voters voting on the measure, a
utility users’ tax will be established at the rate of 5% on the amount customers within
the City pay for water, telecommunications, electricity, gas, video, refuse collection and
sewer. The levy of the tax will commence upon the City Council’s declaration of the
election results and will expire six (6) years later. The revenue the City receives
annually from the utility users’ tax will go into the general fund and will be used to pay
a portion of the costs of the City’s ongoing normal operations and services. The
revenue from the proposed tax, if adopted, is projected to be sufficient to eliminate the
need to proceed with the aforementioned reduction of services and it is projected that
the City Council will have the financial resources necessary to maintain municipal
services at the current level and will restore the Sheriff’s Deputy position that was
eliminated.

If Measure C does not receive approval from a majority of the voters voting on it, the
utility customers in Grand Terrace will not be assessed a 5% tax on their utilities and
the aforementioned reductions in services for the fiscal year 2013-2014 will be
implemented. In addition, it is projected that the City will need to implement additional
cuts in the following fiscal years to balance future budgets, the particulars of which are
not known at this time.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE C

This Argument in Favor of Measure C was submitted pursuant to Section
9282 of the California Elections Code. It is the opinion of the author(s)y
and has been printed exactly as submitted.

Make no mistake, without Measure C, Grand Terrace will have no choice but to cease
providing services to residents, including quick responses to 911 police calls and
emergencies. Parks will be closed, forcing children’s sports teams to travel outside of
the area; local roads will not be adequately repaired; and residents and businesses
may need to go to San Bernardino County offices to get permits and other services.

Without passage of Measure C it will be difficult for Grand Terrace to provide services
as an independent city and in time Grand Terrace could be annexed by Colton.

Like many small cities in California, the City of Grand Terrace has historically
depended on State-provided redevelopment funds to pay for important programs and
services. When the State dissolved all local redevelopment agencies in 2012, Grand
Terrace lost the funding it needs to provide basic city services to local residents.

Over the past three years, the City of Grand Terrace has made severe cuts to staff and
services in order to reduce its expenses. The City has eliminated nearly 60% of its city
hall employees, cut pay by 10% for the few employees who remain, and reduced
benefits.

Measure C has been placed on the ballot after a citizens committee studied city
finances and unanimously recommended a utility user tax to provide funds to keep
basic city services. Senior citizens may be eligible for an exemption.

All money raised by this measure will be used to maintain the quality of services in our
community. It cannot be taken away by the State or be used for other purposes.

By keeping our city safe, clean and well maintained, this measure will help protect
Grand Terrace property values.

Measure C requires a citizens’ oversight committee and independent audits to ensure
that money is spent locally in our community.

Please vote yes to Save Grand Terrace.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE C

to Section 9285 of the California Elections Code. It is the opinion of the
author(s), and has been printed exactly as submitted.

Same old scare tactics. That’s all they know!

Mayor Stanckiewitz and Councilman Sandoval keep pushing the Colton panic button
to ensure their 2014 re-election. Total lack of leadership!

•	The voters must vote and tax themselves to unincorporate and payoff our
debt.

•	Parks represents only 3.5% of the City’s budget.

•	RDA loss was only $738K.

•	Your Kids cell phones too??!! Really?

•	Most of the tax will go to the unfunded pensions for past, current and
FUTURE employees.

•	This tax “maintains” staff’s fat salaries, pensions and benefits.

•	The city manager gets more than $200,000.

•	There is no solid plan to reduce City dependence on the tax.

•	In 1999 we stopped their attempt to tax our utilities by an overwhelming 77%.
We survived! We can do it again!

•	HOA dues and Apartment rents will increase.

•	Businesses will be charged thousands of dollars more a month, most will be
forced to close or raise prices.

•	Seniors will only get discounts if they apply and are below poverty level.

This is our golden opportunity to fix our city. The ONLY Choice!

Go to www.youtube.com. Type in “Sandy Springs Georgia Tax”. A 90,000+
population contract city, has only 5 employees and NO PENSIONS! NO UNFUNDED
LIABILITIES!

They solved their financial problems. Other cities across the country are doing the
same. WE CAN TOO! VOTE NO!

If this fails, you will win! The city will become a contract city and business friendly
once again.

ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE C

This Argument Against Measure C was submitted pursuant to Section 9282
of the California Elections Code. It is the opinion of the author(s), and has
been printed exactly as submitted.

Vote “NO” on Measure “C”. Measure “C” is a multi-million dollar swindle being
perpetrated on the citizens of Grand Terrace.

•	The Budget Advisory Committee voted to remain an incorporated City. The
City Council has repeatedly stated that they want to remain an independent
City even if the tax fails.

•	The Utility Tax will suck up $2,572,000.00 more than the $738,000.00 annual
loss of Redevelopment money?!?.

•	A big chunk will go towards retirement debt for past and present employees.

•	Utility companies are already raising rates. The tax will just make things
worse!

•	Senior citizens must be below poverty level and qualify through H.U.D., the
county, and the City.

Don’t be deceived by scare tactics!

•	Don’t touch our Sheriff protection!

•	Shame on the City Council for closing our parks. How can Council and Staff
expect us to keep funding their benefits, retirement and salaries?

•	Shame on the Council for deserting the Seniors when it means less than % of
one percent of the City’s budget!

Grand Terrace was originally a contract city with a modest budget. We need less
bureaucracy, not more. Our city must return to being a contract city!

•	It’s a tax on every utility use - power, phone, cell phone, data, T.V., natural
gas, water, sewer and trash that the Council and Staff claim will cost the
average household $20.60? Add it up. Who are they kidding?

•	Rents will increase.

•	Businesses will pay more money a month and pass the cost on to you.

•	How many businesses will be forced out? We already have enough
vacancies!

•	What happens when the tax runs out in 6 years?

Stop the Bleeding and vote “NO”.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE C

This Rebuttal to Argument Against Measure C was submitted pursuant to
Section 9285 of the California Elections Code. It is the opinion of the
author(s), and has been printed exactly as submitted.

The opponents of Measure C deliberately mislead voters with incorrect information.
Here is the truth.

This is not about pension plans, employee benefits or increasing bureaucracy.

Measure C simply provides emergency revenue to allow the City to continue providing
services as an independent city. Without Measure C, Grand Terrace will not be able to
provide basic services to the residents of the community. This is a fact.

The largest portion of the City's budget pays for public safety. Without this emergency
source of revenue, the City will have no choice but to cease providing services to
residents, including quick responses to 911 police calls and other critical services.

Since 2008, successive Grand Terrace City Councils have made severe cuts to the
City's budget because of the economic downturn. The cuts have included:

•	Elimination of nearly 60% of city hall staff

•	10% reduction in staff pay

•	Reduction in public safety including traffic and patrol deputies, sheriffs
service specialist and crossing guards

Without Measure C, further cuts will be made across the entire budget. All of the
services that citizens have come to expect will need to be reduced or eliminated
including services that the City contracts with outside sources to provide - public
safety, engineering, parks maintenance, building and street repair.

All Measure C funds will be used locally to benefit City of Grand Terrace citizens.

Measure C requires a citizens' oversight committee and independent audits to ensure
that money is spent properly.

Vote YES on Measure C.
