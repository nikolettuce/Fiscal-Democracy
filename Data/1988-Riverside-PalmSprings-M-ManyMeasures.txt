IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS mcASURE D

On June 4,1974, the California Constitution was amended by the
voters of this state to allow revenues from taxes imposed by the state on
motor vehicle fuels to be used for construction or improvement of
exclusive public mass transit guide ways. Section 4 of Article 19 of the
Constitution requires that where any portion of such monies are to be
used for construction and improvement of mass transit guideways (and
their related facilities), it must be approved by a majority of the votes
cast on the proposition authorizing such use of such revenues on an
election held throughout the County.

A "yes" vote on Measure 0 will allow Riverside County to expend
revenues from taxes on motor vehicle fuels, currently collected by the
state, for the construction and improvement of exclusive public mass
transit guideways.

COUNTY COUNSEL

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure D. If you
desire a copy of the ordinance or measure, please call the Registrar of
Voters at (714) 787-2921 and a copy will be mailed at no cost to you.

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE I

This proposition provides for an increase in the transient occupancy
tax in the City of Indio from eight percent (8%) to ten percent
(10%). Transient occupancy tax is not a sales, transaction or ad
valorem tax on real property and does not violate the equal protection or
due process clauses of the Constitution. The proposed resolution is not
a tax upon real or personal property, nor is it a tax addressed to the
taxpayers of the City of Indio; rather, it is a tax imposed upon a transient
for the privilege of occupying a room in the City of Indio. In the event
tie City of Indio's current transient occupancy tax rate is increased from
the current eight percent (8%) to ten percent (10%), approximately
$106,000.00 in additional revenue will be generated annually for
general purpose revenue.

A transient occupancy tax is an excise tax imposed for the privilege
of occupying lodgings far less than thirty days, paid by the occupant and
collected and delivered to the City by the operator.

The City Council of the City of Indio has called an elect or for the
purpose of submitting the resolution to the voters within the City of Indio
for adoption.

A "yes" vote on Measure I is a vote to adopt the resolution.

A "no" vote on Measure I is a vote against adopting, the resolution.

Hi ARGUMENTS FOB OR AGAINST T > *^.URE WIRE SUBMITTED.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE D

Measure D means Riverside County will receive its fair share of State
funds for commuter rail.

State law allows voters in each county to request State funds to help
finance rail transit projects. Voters in eight counties have voted to
receive these funds.

We all know Riverside County faces intolerable traffic congestion.
Commuter rail service using existing railroad tracks will help solve traffic
congestion from Riverside to Los Angeles and Orange Counties.
Commuter rail transit from the City of Riverside to Petris and Hemet will
also reduce congestion within the County.

Measure D will also improve air quality by providing a means for traffic to
move along and not sit idling in endless traffic jams. It will reduce the
number of vehicles on our freeways that create air pollution, and allow

the remaining vehicles to move faster and more efficiently, also reducing
our SMOG problem.

Our commuters need this alternative to the automobile where it can be
shown to be effective and efficient. Measure D insures the State will
pay its fair share to match our local funds to get the job done and at no
additional' cost to Riverside' County taxpayers!

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS MEASURE H

Proposition 62, codified in Government Code Section 53720 through
53730 was approved by the November 4,1886 General Election. The
Proposition « not yet judicially tested, however the Legislative Counsel

is of the opinion it requires voter approval of all new or increased taxes,
''if the amount or rate of increase is not already provided for or
authorized by ordinance." The proposition is applied retroactively to
August 1, 1985,

On May 27,1986 the City of Hemet adopted Ordinance No. 1185, which
became effective July 1, 1986. The ordinance increased the City’s
transient occupancy tax from 7% to 8%.

The transient occupancy tax is levied on the users of hotels and motels
and is based on a percentage of the room rent collected at the time the
bill is paid. The tax is deposited to the City's general fund for general
governmental purposes.

If approved by the voters, the transient occupancy tax. will remain at
8%. If not approved by the voters, the transient occupancy tax will be

reduced to 7%.

A majority vote of the voters voting in the election is required for
approval.

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS ME/^fE L

Pursuant to the provisions of Elections We Section 5011, the
following is submitted as impartial analysis of City Measure L to appear
on the ballot at the election to be held November 8, 1988.

MEASURE L

Shall the Business License Tax rates established by
Ordinance No. 1257, adopted February 19,1988, amend-
ing Chapters 3.84 and 3.90 of the Palm Springs Municipal
Code, be continued in full force and effect after November
15, 1988; and shall the appropriations limit imposed by
Article XIII B of the California Constitution be increased in
amounts equivalent to the proceeds of the Business
License Tax?

The City of Palm Springs has levied a business license tax since
1938. In February, 1986, the rate structure of such tax was revised
and increased, in three stages, to the level now being charged. The
increased rates of tax may not continue to be imposed after November
15, 1988, unless approved by majority vote of the voters voting in an
election on the issue of imposition.

If a majority of the voters vote in favor of the measure, the business
license tax will continue indefinitely at the same rates as are currently
being charged, and the appropriations limit of the City pursuant to
California Constitution Article XIII B will be increased in amounts
equivalent to the proceeds of the Business License Tax.

If a majority of the voters vote against the measure, the business
license tax will revert to the rates in effect prior to FeBruary, 1986. The
fiscal effect of reverting to the former rates would be a reduction of
revenue to the City of Palm Springs estimated at $150,000 each year.

By: WILLIAM J. ADAMS, City Attorney

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure L. If you
desire a copy of the ordinance or measure, please call the City Clerk at
(619) 323-8206 and a copy will be mailed at no cost to you.

ARGUMENT " FAVOR OF MEASURE L

A "yes" vote on Measure L will help with the financing of police and
fire protection, library services, street work and administrative expenses.
About $ 150,000 in revenue will be received by the City of Palm Springs
this fiscal year as a result of the present business license tax.

Continuation of the business license tax does not present an unfair
burden on business operators in Palm Springs. In fact, when the 10
percent per year increase was approved in 1986 for a three-year period,
it was the first time in 15 years that business license tax rates had been
raised.

Approval of this measure does not mean that any new tax will be
impored on business operators or that the existing tax rate will be
increased. The present rate will simply remain in full force after
election day.

We urge voters to approve continuation of business license tax
rates by voting "yes”.

Palm Springs is an ideal place to live and raise a family. Voting
"yes” is one small way we can keep it that way.

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS MEASURE M

Pursuant to the provisions of Elections Code Section 5011, the
following is submitted as impartial analysis of City Measure M to appear
on the ballot at the election to be held November 8, 1988.

MEASURE M

Shall the taxes imposed on users of telephone services,
electricity and gas by Sections 3.32.030, 3.32.040, and
3.32.050 respectively of the Palm Springs Municipal Code
continue to be imposed until November 15,1993, and then
cease unless continuation past that date is approved by
majority vote at an election held before November 15,

1992, and shall the appropriations limit imposed by Article
XIIIB of the California Constitution be increased in amounts
equivalent to the proceeds of such taxes?

Existing ordinances of the City of Palm Springs impose a 3% tax on
the charges made to users of telephone services, electricity and gas. Under
existing State law, such tax may not continue to be imposed on or after
November 15,1988, unless approved by a majority of the voters voting
in an election on the issue of imposition.

If a majority of the voters vote in favor of this measure, the 3% tax
on telephone services, electricity and gas may continue until November
15, 1993. The tax shall cease on or before that date unless further
continuation of the tax is approved by the voters at another election held
before November 15, 1992.

If a majority of the voters vote in favor of this measure, the
appropriations limit of the City of Palm Springs pursuant to California
Constitution Article XIII B will increase by an amount equal to the
aggregate sum collected by levy of the utility users taxes.

If a majority of the voters vote against this measure, the 3% tax on
telephone service, electricity and gas will no longer be imposed on and
after November 15, 1988. The fiscal effect of cessation of the tax
would be a reduction of revenue to the City of Palm Springs estimated at
$2,300,000 each year.

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS ME/ "E L

Pursuant to the provisions of Elections Section 5011, the
following is submitted as impartial analysis of City Measure L to appear
on the ballot at the election to be held November 8, 1988.

MEASURE L

Shall the Business License Tax rates established by
Ordinance No. 1257, adopted February 19,1986, amend-
ing Chapters 3.84 and 3.90 of the Palm Springs Municipal
Code, he continued in full force and effect after November
15, 1988; and shall the appropriations limit imposed by
Article XIIIB of the California Constitution be increased in
amounts equivalent to the proceeds of the Business
License Tax?

The City of Palm Springs has levied a business license tax since
1938. In February, 1986, the rate structure of such tax was revised
and increased, in three stages, to the level now being charged. The
increased rates of tax may not continue to be imposed after November
15, 1988, unless approved by majority vote of the voters voting in an
election on the issue of imposition.

If a majority of the voters vote in favor of the measure, the business
license tax will continue indefinitely at the same rates as are currently
being charged, and the appropriations limit of the City pursuant to
California Constitution Article XIII B will be increased in amounts
equivalent to the proceeds of the Business License Tax.

If a majority of the voters vote against the measure, the business
license tax will revert to'the rates in effect prior to February, 1986. The
fiscal effect of reverting to the former rates would he a reduction of
revenue to the City of Palm Springs estimated at $150,000 each year.

By; WILLIAM J. ADAMS, City Attorney

ARGUMENT ‘ ^ C*YQR OF MEASURE L

A "yes" vote on Measure I. will help with the financing of police and
fire protection, library services, street work and administrative expenses.
About $150,000 in revenue will be received by the City of Palm Springs
this fiscal year as a result of the present business license tax.

Continuation of the business license tax does not present an unfair
burden on business operators in Palm Springs. In fact, when the 10
percent per year increase was approved in 1986 for a three-year period,
it was the first time in 15 years that business license tax rates had been
raised.

Approval of this measure does not mean that any new tax will be
impored on business operators or that the existing tax rate will be
increased. The present rate will simply remain in full force after
election day.

We urge voters to approve continuation of business license tax
rates by voting "yes".

Palm Springs is an ideal place to live and raise a family. Voting
"yes" is one small way we can keep it that way.

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS MEASURE M

Pursuant to the provisions of Elections Code Section 5011, the
following is submitted as impartial analysis of City Measure M to appear
on the ballot at the election to he held November 8, 1988.

MEASURE M

Shall the taxes imposed on users of telephone services,
electricity and gas by Sections 3.32.030, 3.32.040, and
3.32.050 respectively of the Palm Springs Municipal Code
continue to be imposed until November 15,1993, and then
cease unless continuation past that date is approved by
majority vote at an election held before November 15,

1992, and shall the appropriations limit imposed by Article
XIIIB of the California Constitution be increased in amounts
equivalent to the proceeds of such taxes?

Existing ordinances of the City of Palm Springs impose a 3% tax on
the charges made to users of telephone services, electricity and gas. Under
existing State law, such tax may not continue to be imposed on or after
November 15,1988, unless approved by a majority of the voters voting
in an election on the issue of imposition.

If a majority of the voters vote in favor of this measure, the 3% tax
on telephone services, electricity and gas may continue until November
15, 1993. The tax shall cease on or before that date unless further
continuation of the tax is approved by the voters at another election held
before November 15, 1992.

If a majority of the voters vote in favor of this measure, the
appropriations limit of the City of Palm Springs pursuant to California
Constitution Article XIII B will increase by an amount equal to the
aggregate sum collected by levy of the utility users taxes.

If a majority of the voters vote against this measure, the 3% tax on
telephone service, electricity and gas will no longer be imposed on and
after November 15, 1988. The fiscal effect of cessation of the tax
would be a reduction of revenue to the City of Palm Springs estimated at
$2,300,000 each year.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR Ov IASURE M

We urge voters to approve continuation of the utility tax because it
is the only real solution to the city's short-term budget problem.

Cuts have already been made. The City Council's plan to infuse
new revenue into the community has been launched and money from five
major annual special events, development of a sports/recreation/cultur-
al complex and improvement of the downtown will go a long way to bring
the city budget back in balance.

But it cannot be done overnight. Measure M asks voters to
approve continuation of the tax for five more years. That will provide
enough time for the new programs to take effect and for Palm Springs to
regain economic stability. In the meantime, the needed services and
high quality of life here can continue. The ultimate fate of the tax is
and will be in the hands of the voters. The tax cannot be continued
beyond five years unless it receives further voter approval.

The three percent tax on telephone, electricity and gas bills has
been in effect for two years. Statistics show it has cost the average
homeowner about $8 per month. We think that's a reasonable price to
pay to continue the many services that Palm Springs residents deserve.

Please give the City Council enough time for the planned
improvements, promotion and special events to generate new revenue
and eliminate the budget deficit.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE M

The City routinely transfers monies among its 22 Funds. The
average of total reserves has increased $5 million despite the past two
years' stated deficits in its General Fund. Last year, the Council voted
10.8 million in new taxes.

On this measure, you have a vote to restrict the growth of
taxation. Your "No" will require the City administration to further trim
the waste.

Reduction in taxation will spur the economy in line with current
efforts by the City Council, and the existing reserves are adequate to

span the transition.

Vote "No" on Measure M.

By: Jeremy Crocker

ARGtv JI AGAINST MEASURE M
Ballot Argument against Utility Users' Tax Measure M

Signs of an economic upturn locally are already visible. It would
be unfortunate to commit the taxpayers for a five-year period when the
City has a cash cushion, invested in term deposits, ample to bridge the
transition. Currently this exceeds 140 million. A tax, once instituted,
tends to be raised.

When governmental revenues are reduced, more revenue remains
in private hands. When those are increased, so also is the temptation
for ill-advised projects.

By: Jeremy Crocker

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE M

There is no $40 million "cash cushion" on which the city can rely to
"bridge the transition." By the end of the year, the city will have less
than $3 million in cash reserves intended for essential operations.

Signs of an economic upturn are not visible yet. Room taxes,
sales taxes and property taxes are all less than anticipated. However,
we are working to make sure that an economic upturn will take place as
soon as possible. The promise of that will be seen in the Palm Springs
vintage Grand Prix Race later this month — the first of many efforts that
we are making to bring revenues to the city.

If voters approve the tax, it will be for a specific five-year
period. Then it will end. Only by a vote of the people can it be
continued or brought back.

We are just asking the voters to give us enough time to allow our
plans to work. When new revenues are channeled into the community
and when the city once again prospers, we will no longer need the utility
tax.

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS MEA^uriE S

On June 9, 1986, Ordinance No. 629 was adopted by the City
Council of the City of Beaumont as an Urgency Ordinance to establish
utility tax on telephone, electric, gas, and cable T.V. utility users.
Codified as Chapter 13.14 of the Beaumont Municipal Code, Ordinance
629 established a flat tax of three (3%) percent on intrastate telephone
service, electricity use, natural gas use, and cable television use by all
users, commercial and residential.

Pursuant to the Ordinance, regular collection of the tax is made by
the supplier of the service by inclusion in the regular monthly billing
submitted to the user of the service. The City, however, reserves the
powers to collect by direct assessment or legal action the taxes owed by
any user who does not pay the service supplier on a monthly basis as
provided, as well as to collect from any supplier who fails to forward
taxes collected. Late payment penalties and interest are collectible by
the City. A system for overpayment refunds and record keeping is
established by the Ordinance.

Section 13.14.101 provides for an exemption from this tax for any
household with a combined annual gross income of $7,500.00 or
less. The exemption, or refund of taxes paid, is obtained by application
to the Tax Administrator, whom the Ordinance designates as the Finance
Director of the City of Beaumont.' A maximum ■ monthly tax of
$2,000.00 per month for a single telephone service user, $3,000.00 per
month for an electricity service user, $3,000.00 per month for a natural
gas service user and $ 1,000.00 per month tax for a cable television user
is provided by the Ordinance.

The Ordinance provides a "sunset provision" under which the tax
expires on July 1,1991. Any renewal of the tax after that time would
require, pursuant to State Law, a vote of the people.

According to information from the City for the fiscal year ending
June 30,1988, the utility user's tax yielded a total of $217,108.36 in
revenue to the City. Costs of collection were very minimal as the work
of collecting from individual users is handled by the utility providers
without any charge to the City. The funds from the utility user's tax
were placed into the City’s general funds where they were used for a
variety of activities including police, fire, street maintenance, and other
basic services.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Ordinance 629
(Measure $). If you desire a copy of the Ordinance, please call the
City Clerk at (714) 845-1171 and a copy will be mailed at no cost to
you.

ARGUMENT FAVOR OF MEASURE S

The loss of federal revenue sharing has given municipal government new
challenges in providing police, fire, street maintenance and other basic
services at their prior level.

Ordinance 629, which established the current utility user tax, has
enabled Beaumont to meet those challenges.

Hopefully, we could maintain this level without the ordinance for a short
while, but the inevitable expansion of a vital city could seriously damage
our ability to do so as early as 1989.

Damaging, too, would be the deferred replacement of worn-out
equipment, or failure to provide up-to-date equipment. Items needed
to continue to offer the best possible service to our citizens is contingent
upon the outcome of this election.

Also at stake is our present ability to fund day-to-day street maintenance
from our general fund, saving gas tax revenue for large projects.

29.5 percent of the monies generated by this ordinance is used for
employee salaries.

To attract and keep the same high quality employees as we now have, we
must provide wages comparable to the surrounding communities.

Our employees need and deserve comparability of pay and cost-of-living

parity.

Everyone realizes that costs are high for us all. That is why an
exemption for low-income households is built into this ordinance, and the
business community must shoulder a greater share.

But all of us also want to live and work in a thriving, well-planned
community, with fire protection that inspires our confidence, well-eared-
for streets, and a modern, well-respected, efficient police department.

With our citizens pulling together, we are building such a community.

This ordinance gives you so much for so little.

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS \..cASURE D

On June 4,1974, the California Constitution was amended by the
voters of this state to allow revenues from taxes imposed by the state on
motor vehicle fuels to be used for construction or improvement of
exclusive public mass transit guideways. Section 4 of Article 19 of the
Constitution requires that where any portion of such monies are to be
used for construction and improvement of mass transit guideways (and
their related facilities), it must be approved by a majority of the votes
cast on the proposition authorizing such use of such revenues on an
election held throughout the County.

A "yes" vote on Measure D will allow Riverside County to expend
revenues from taxes on motor vehicle fuels, currently collected by the
state, for the construction and improvement of exclusive public mass
transit guideways.

COUNTY COUNSEL

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure D. If you
desire a copy of the ordinance dr measure, please call the Registrar of
Voters at (714) 787-2921 and a copy will be mailed at no cost to you.

ARGUMSMf IN FAVOR OF MEASURE D

Measure D means Riverside County will receive its fair share of State
funds for commuter rail.

State law allows voters in each county to request State funds to help
finance rail transit projects. Voters in eight counties have voted to
receive these funds.

We all know Riverside County faces intolerable traffic congestion.
Commuter rail service using existing railroad tracks will help solve traffic
congestion from Riverside to Los Angeles and Orange Counties.
Commuter rail transit from the City of Riverside to Perris and Hemet will
also reduce congestion within the County.

Measure D will also improve air quality by providing a means for traffic to
move along and not sit idling in endless traffic jams. It will reduce the
number of vehicles on our freeways that create air pollution, and allow
the remaining vehicles to move faster and more efficiently, also reducing
our SMOG problem.

Our commuters need this alternative to the automobile where it can be
shown to be effective and efficient. Measure D insures the State will
pay its fair share to match our local funds to get the job done and at no
additional cost to Riverside County taxpayers!

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS MEASURE i

This measure provides for an increase in the transient occupancy
tax in the City of Rancho Mirage from eight (8) percent to nine (9)
percent. A transient occupancy tax is a tax imposed for the privilege of
occupying lodgings such as hotels or motels for a period of less than
thirty days. The tax is paid by the transient occupant. The operator of
the lodging is required to collect and deliver the tax to the City of Rancho
Mirage. One of the uses of the transient occupancy tax is to defray the
cost of providing public services to tourists who frequent the City of
Rancho Mirage,

Ordinance No. 410 is not a tax upon real property or personal
property nor is it a tax directed to the taxpayers of the City of Rancho
Mirage. The tax is simply a tax imposed upon tourists for the privilege
of occupying a hotel or motel room within the City of Rancho Mirage. In
the event the City of Rancho Mirage is able to increase tie transient
occupancy tax from eight (8) percent to nine (9) percent, approximately
$360,000 will be added to the City's General Fund for the benefit of
citizens and residents of the City of Rancho Mirage.

The City Council has called an election for the purpose of
submitting Ordinance No. 410 to the voters within the City of Rancho
Mirage. If a majority of voters voting on Measure N approve it.
Ordinance No. 410 will become effective.

A "yes" vote on Measure N is a vote to adopt the Ordinance

increasing the transient occupancy tax from eight (8) percent to nine (9)
percent.

A "no" vote on Measure N is a vote against adopting the
Ordinance.

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS MEASURE R

This measure provides for an increase in the transient occupancy
tax in the City of Palm Desert from six percent (6%) to eight percent (8%).
Transient occupancy tax is not a sales, transaction or ad valorem tax on
real property and does not violate the equal protection or due process
clauses of the Constitution. The proposed ordinance is not a tax upon
real or personal property, nor is a tax addressed to the taxpayers of the
City of Palm Desert; rather, it is a tax imposed upon a transient for the
privilege of occupying a room in the City of Palm Desert. In the event
the City of Palm Desert's current transient occupancy tax rate is
increased from the current six percent (6%) to eight percent (8%),
approximately one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) in additional revenue
will be generated annually for general purpose revenue.

A transient occupancy tax is an excise tax imposed for the privilege
of occupying lodgings for less than thirty days, paid by the occupant and
collected and delivered to the City by the operator.

The City of Palm Desert may reach its appropriations limit due to
increased revenue from the transient occupancy tax rate increase, as
well as anticipated growth within the City. The California Constitution
restricts the annual appropriations of local government agencies to the
appropriations limit for the prior year adjusted for changes in cost of
living and population. The City of Palm Desert may not expend any tax
revenues it receives above that limit unless the voters within the City of
Palm Desert increase the limit. If the transient occupancy rate increase
is approved, additional revenues will be generated annually.

Pursuant to the California Constitution, the City Council of the City
of Palm Desert has proposed to the voters that an ordinance be adopted
authorizing an increase in the appropriations limit for the City of Palm
Desert for fiscal years ending 1989 through 1992, with the base year for
1988/89 appropriations limit to be increased to twenty-five million
dollars ($25,000,000.00).

The proposed ordinance does not authorize the City Council to
increase the property tax rate within the City of Palm Desert. The
ordinance merely authorizes an increase in the appropriations limit to
enable the City Council to expend monies obtained from existing
sources. Revenues received by the City above the existing appropria-
tions limit will be used to provide city services.

The City Council has called an election for the purpose of
submitting the ordinance to the voters within the City of Palm Desert for
adoption. If a majority of the voters voting on the measure approve it,
the ordinance will be operative for fiscal years ending 1989 through
1992.

A "yes" vote on Measure R is a vote to adopt the ordinance.

A "no" vote on Measure R is a vote against adopting the ordinance.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR MEASURE R

Your city depends on a transient occupancy tax (hotel room tax), sales
tax revenues and user fees to provide most of the police protection, road
improvements and upkeep, parks and recreation facilities, and other
services provided from the city's general fund. One major source of
funding for 93% of California cities, a share of the locally collected
property taxes, is denied to Palm Desert by a legislative interpretation of
proposition 13. Despite this handicap. Palm Desert has the best
financial health of all the cities of the Coachella Valley. As a prime
destination resort city. Palm Desert is experiencing major growth in the
hotel and business segments of our community. This growth has
increased the financial pressures on the Palm Desert city budget. Cer-
tainly hotel guests and visitors place added burdens on all of our city
services. To offset these costs, other cities in the Coachella Valley
have hotel room tax rates of 9 to 10%. At 6%, Palm Desert's is the
lowest in the Valley. The proposed increase to 8% in the room tax paid
by hotel guests still leaves Palm Desert hotels with a low room tax and an
enjoyable economic position. The local Chamber of Commerce has
recognized this and is in support of the room tax increase. The
revenues generated by the 2% increase will allow more freedom to meet
our rapidly expanding needs. As examples, roads, parks, police, open
space and recreation could benefit from the passage of Measure R. As
members of your City Council, we will appreciate your support and a
"Yes" vote on Measure R.
