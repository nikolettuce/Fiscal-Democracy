MEASURE HH
CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

The City Council of the City of San Leandro has placed Measure HH on the November 4, 2014 ballot
to ask voters to approve an ordinance that would extend the temporary one-quarter of one percent
(0.25%) transactions and use tax within the City at the half-cent rate (0.50%). If approved, the tax
would add a half-cent for every dollar spent, or $0.50 to the price of an item that costs $100.

Currently, the tax on retail sales in San Leandro is 9.250% of the purchase price. The City’s share is
1.25%. The remainder goes to the State (5.50%), the State Public Safety Fund (0.50%), the State Public
Education Fund (0.25%), Alameda County (0.25%), the Alameda County Transportation Commission
(0.50%), the Alameda County Essential Health Care Services Initiative (0.50%) and BART (0.50%).

Technically, the existing “sales tax” is a combination of a “sales and use tax” and “transactions and use
tax.” With some exceptions, both are levied on the sale or use of tangible personal property sold at
retail. Retailers collect the tax at the time of sale and remit the funds to the State Board of Equalization,
which administers the tax.

This Measure, if approved by the voters, would authorize a 0.50% transactions and use tax, which would
increase the total sales tax rate on retail sales in San Leandro to 9.50%. Of the total rate, 1.5% would go
to the City’s general fund and be available to support the full range of municipal services. Because this
Measure does not limit the use of tax revenue, it is a “general tax,” not a “special tax” that restricts the
funds to specific purposes. Therefore, as explained in the ballot question, the City may use the funds
for a range of services, including but not limited to maintaining current levels of 9-1-1 emergency
response times; neighborhood police patrols and anti-gang enforcement; library programs for children,
adults, and families; after school programs for children and teens including homework assistance and
reading programs, repairing potholes and maintaining residential streets; and school police officers and
crossing guards.

The tax would terminate automatically 30 years after collection begins.

The Measure requires the City Council to appoint a five-person committee of members of the public to
review and report on the revenue and expenditure of funds from the tax.

A “Yes” vote is a vote to approve the enactment of the temporary half-cent tax for 30 years, with
oversight by a committee of members of the public. A “No” vote is a vote against the tax. This
Measure would be approved if it receives a simple majority of “Yes” votes.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure HH. If you desire a copy of the ordinance,
please call the City Clerk’s office at 510-577-3367 and a copy will be mailed at no cost to you.

funding source for essential city services including 9-1-1 response, neighborhood police patrols, anti-gang
efforts, library programs and services, and fire protection.

By law, YES on HH requires every dime to continue to be used for our LOCAL services, and Sacramento can’t
touch it!

Argument Against Measure HH

In the immortal words of Yogi Berra, “It’s deja vu all over again” for San Leandro
taxpayers. When Measure Z passed 4 years ago in the aftermath of the financial collapse, it was
called “Temporary Emergency Funding” and was intended to bridge the budget deficits created
by the previous city council’s poor fiscal management. To bribe the voters into supporting it,
they promised this tax would only last for seven years and would sunset when it was no longer
necessary.

Sadly, when trying to raise taxes, politicians at all levels conveniently forget promises
they made only 4 years ago. Those of us who signed the original argument against Measure Z in
2010 predicted they would try to extend this “temporary tax” and now we’ve been proven
correct. When it comes to issues of integrity, history demonstrates that our city council suffers
from a peculiar kind of amnesia. Should this measure pass, don’t be surprised if we soon see
them promoting yet another new and improved “temporary tax,” hoping that voters will once
again forget the promises made in the previous election.

We’ve seen the economy improve and the city has passed balanced budgets for three
years in a row, so isn’t it about time they ended this “state of emergency?” What possible
justification can they have for doubling this temporary tax and extending it for another 30 years?

It’s time for voters to hold the city council to its word. Raising “emergency” taxes to
meet routine operating expenses isn’t anything remotely resembling “leadership.” It just
demonstrates poor financial discipline.

Rewarding bad behavior only encourages more of it. A promise is a promise. Honest
people keep their word. Make the city keep its promise! Vote NO on the Measure Z extension.

Rebuttal to Argument in Favor of Measure HH

Proponents of Measure HH claim that doubling the tax and extending it for 30 years will
do nothing more than maintain existing city services at current levels. Why then can’t we let the
tax continue at its present rate until it expires in 2018? In four more years, if they have a valid
justification for continuing it or even raising it, perhaps then we’ll support the idea.

As it stands, Measure Z has failed spectacularly in one specific area. Even its supporters
admit “our streets are the second worst in the County! ” Did they conveniently forget that one of
the biggest promises they made to the taxpayers in 2010 was that these funds would be used to fix
potholes and maintain roads? The report issued by the Measure Z Citizen’s Oversight Committee
shows only 6% of the revenue generated by the tax (less than $250,000) was spent on public
works, 6% went to libraries and 5% went to the Recreation and Human Services Department.
What happened to the rest of the money? Well, $2.4 million went to service the debt accumulated
to remodel City Hall and the Main Library and $2.1 million went to refinance the city’s pension
obligation bonds.

Is it unreasonable to ask why they want to double the tax today (instead of in 2018) and
ask our grandchildren to pay it until 2048?

Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. Let’s not be fooled again!

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE HH

Vote YES on HH to protect and maintain OUR services, including public safety and roads. Here
are the facts opponents aren’t telling you.

FACT: Since 2011, San Leandro has LOST OVER $5 MILLION EACH YEAR due to
Sacramento politicians eliminating redevelopment agencies statewide.

FACT: Measure Z, passed by San Leandro voters in 2010, has prevented deep cuts to public
safety and other essential services. YES on HH continues this critical funding.

FACT: Measure Z funding is temporary and will expire. Without YES on HH. we face over
$4.5 million in cuts, including police, fire, 9-1-1 response and library services.

Measure HH funds cannot be taken by Sacramento, and will remain in San Leandro for
OUR local services and to repair OUR neighborhood streets.

An Independent Citizens Oversight Committee will continue to review every penny of Measure
HH, as they have for the last 4 years, ensuring funds are spent on community priorities.

Opponents present NO solutions to protect OUR services!

YES on HH maintains 9-1-1 response times, neighborhood patrols, school police officers, anti-
gang efforts, and fire protection.

YES on HH maintains library programs for children, adults, and families, providing kids with
safe places to go after school.

YES on HH provides new funds to fix our roads and neighborhood streets - which
independent experts rate as the second worst in the County - to reduce costly damage to cars and
prevent accidents.

YES on HH is supported by businesses, community leaders and homeowners because it
maintains the critical services our community needs.

ORDINANCE NO. 2014-012

ORDINANCE OF THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY OF SAN LEANDRO
ENACTING A TRANSACTIONS AND USE TAX TO BE ADMINISTERED BY THE

STATE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION

WHEREAS, Section 7285.9 of the California Revenue and Taxation Code authorizes
cities to levy, increase or extend a transactions and use tax (“sales tax” or “sales and use tax”) at
a rate of 0.125% (or any multiple thereof) to be expended for general purposes, which
transactions and use tax is subject to the approval by a two-thirds majority vote of all the
members of the City Council and by a majority vote of the qualified voters of the City voting in
an election on the issue; and

WHEREAS, Article XIII C, section 2 of the California Constitution requires that a
general tax must be approved by a majority vote of the qualified voters of the City voting in an
election on the issue, and that said election shall be consolidated with a regularly scheduled
general election for members of the governing body of the local government; and

WHEREAS, a majority of the voters of the City of San Leandro approved a one-quarter
cent (0.25%) Transactions and Use (Sales) Tax, which expires March 2018; and

WHEREAS, this local funding that cannot be taken by the State has ensured that current
service levels for public safety, parks, libraries, and other City services and programs are
maintained with a reliable source of voter-approved funding; and

WHEREAS, although this funding maintains current service levels, it does not allow the
City to address a growing backlog of unfunded public safety, infrastructure, and other program
and service needs; and

WHEREAS, upon expiration of the current sales and use tax measure, the City of San
Leandro faces an ongoing budget deficit in the magnitude of approximately $4 million annually,
which would result in drastic reductions in many of the City’s existing services, facilities and
programs such as cuts to neighborhood patrol officers, fire prevention services, 911 emergency
response services, school officers and crossing guards unless additional sources of revenue can be
found; and

WHEREAS, thousands of people visit San Leandro every day and existing, voter-
approved local funding ensures that those visitors pay their fair share for police, fire, street repair
and other services visitors use when they are in San Leandro; and

WHEREAS, any voter-approved funding would continue to include annual audits and
oversight by the City’s Independent Citizens’ Oversight Committee of community members to
ensure funds are spent properly; and

WHEREAS, at its July 7, 2014 regular meeting, the City Council considered calling a
special election to seek voter approval of a proposed new temporary general transactions and use
tax (sales tax), as authorized by Revenue and Taxation Code section 7285.9; and

WHEREAS, at that meeting, the City Council concluded that all of the information
presented indicated that to obtain the revenue necessary to maintain and enhance service levels,
the City Council should call an election to ask the voters of the City to approve a ballot measure
for a local transactions and use (sales) tax extension for thirty (30) years, the revenue from which
would be used to support general municipal services, including but not limited to significant City
street and road infrastructure projects; and

WHEREAS, on the basis of the foregoing, the City Council determined that it was
appropriate to place a measure regarding a temporary general transactions and use (sales) tax
before the voters at the November 4, 2014 general election; and

WHEREAS, the tax, if approved, would be imposed on the sale of tangible personal
property and the storage, use, or other consumption of such property. The tax rate would be one-
half of one percent (0.5%) (i.e. one half-cent for each dollar) of the sales price of tangible
personal property. The tax revenue would be collected by the State Board of Equalization and
remitted to the City. The tax would be in effect for 30 years, and would then expire
automatically, unless extended by the voters. The tax is approved if the measure receives at least
a simple majority of affirmative votes of qualified City voters.

BE IT ORDAINED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY OF SAN LEANDRO AS
FOLLOWS:

SECTION 1. AMENDMENT OF CODE

Title 2 of the San Leandro Municipal Code is hereby amended to add a new Chapter 2-19

provisions hereof be interpreted in order to accomplish those purposes:

(a)	To impose a retail transactions and use tax in accordance with the provisions of
Part 1.6 (commencing with Section 7251) of Division 2 of the California Revenue and Taxation

Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.

(c)	To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that imposes a tax and
provides a measure therefore that can be administered and collected by the State Board of

possible deviation from, the existing statutory and administrative procedures followed by the
State Board of Equalization in administering and collecting the California State Sales and Use
Taxes.

(d)	To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that can be administered in a
manner that will be, to the greatest degree possible, consistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of
Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting the transactions
and use taxes, and at the same time, minimize the burden of record keeping upon persons subject
to taxation under the provisions of this ordinance.

the operative date of this ordinance.

Section 2-19-125.	Place of Sale.

For the purposes of this ordinance, all retail sales are consummated at the place of business of the
retailer unless the tangible personal property sold is delivered by the retailer or his agent to an
out-of-state destination or to a common carrier for delivery to an out-of-state destination. The
gross receipts from such sales shall include delivery charges, when such charges are subject to
the state sales and use tax, regardless of the place to which delivery is made. In the event a

retailer has no permanent place of business in the State or has more than one place of business,
the place or places at which the retail sales are consummated shall be determined under rules and
regulations to be prescribed and adopted by the State Board of Equalization.

Section 2-19-130. Use Tax Rate.

An excise tax is hereby imposed on the storage, use or other consumption in the City of tangible
personal property purchased from any retailer on and after the operative date of this ordinance
for storage, use or other consumption in said territory at the rate of 0.5% of the sales price of the
property. The sales price shall include delivery charges when such charges are subject to state
sales or use tax regardless of the place to which delivery is made.

Section 2-19-135. Adoption of Provisions of State Law.

the provisions of Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, all of the provisions

hereby adopted and made a part of this ordinance as though fully set forth herein.

Section 2-19-140. Limitations on Adoption of State Law and Collection of Use Taxes.

In adopting the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code:

(a)	Wherever the State of California is named or referred to as the taxing agency, the

Treasurer, State Board of Control, State Board of Equalization, State Treasury, or the
Constitution of the State of California;

(2)	The result of that substitution would require action to be taken by or
against this City or any agency, officer, or employee thereof rather than by or against the State
Board of Equalization, in performing the functions incident to the administration or operation of
this Ordinance.

(3)	In those sections, including, but not necessarily limited to sections
referring to the exterior boundaries of the State of California, where the result of the substitution
would be to:

(B)	Impose this tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use or
other consumption of tangible personal property which would not be subject to tax by the state

(4)	In Sections 6701, 6702 (except in the last sentence thereof), 6711,6715,
6737, 6797 or 6828 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.

engaged in business in this State" in Section 6203 and in the definition of that phrase in Section
6203.

Section 2-19-145.	Permit Not Required.

If a seller's permit has been issued to a retailer under Section 6067 of the Revenue and Taxation
Code, an additional transactor's permit shall not be required by this ordinance.
