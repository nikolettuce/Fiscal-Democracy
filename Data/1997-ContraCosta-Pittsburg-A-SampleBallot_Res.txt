MEASURE A

Shall the ordinance approving the San Marco Casino/Convcntion Center by amending Pittsburg Municipal Code Chapter 5.24 entitled “Cardrooms”; authorizing a Cardroom	YES	
License for the San Marco Casino site; approving a tax rate structure and fees for a Cardroom License; approving a General Plan Amendment for the San Marco Subdivision Village “A” Property; amending the Planned Development Plan for the San Marco Subdivision; and approving an amendment to the San Marco Development	NO	
Agreement be adopted?		

City Attorney’s Impartial Ballot Analysis

Seecon Financial & Construction Company, Inc. (“Seecon”) has applied to the City for approval
to construct a 56,750 square foot convention center/casino and related development (“Project”) at the
Village “A” portion of Seecon’s previously approved San Marco subdivision. The Project would be
located on the south side of State Highway 4 just east of the Bay Point interchange at the northeast
corner of the anticipated extension of West Lcland Road and Willow Pass Road in Pittsburg (the
“Site”). The Project includes a 68 table cardroom, along with convention, restaurant and related
facilities.

On January 13, 1997, the City Council certified the Final Supplemental Environmental Impact
Report for the Project. On January 21, 1997, the Council placed the measure on the ballot.

if approved by a majority of Pittsburg voters. Measure “A” would amend Municipal Code
Chapter 5.24 to:

a.	require voter approval for the issuance of any Cardroom License for a site specific location
which location must appear on the ballot;

b.	authorize the issuance of a Cardroom License for the Project at the Site pursuant to the
provisions of Chapter 5.24 and the amendments thereto contained in Measure “A” in effect on the
effective date of the Measure (the license requires a separate application and approval by the City
Council);

c.	approve a tax rate structure for new Cardroom Licenses that requires the licensee to pay the
city (i) a monthly tax on gaming revenue of ten percent of the total monthly gross revenue of the $0
to $1,000,000; (ii) a monthly tax of 12.5% of the total monthly gross revenue of the next $1,000,001
to $2,000,000; (iii) a monthly tax of 15.0% for revenues over $2,000,000 and an application fee of ten
thousand dollars ($10,000) for a Cardroom License; and (iv) a minimum monthly payment of at least
one hundred thousand dollars by the licensee following the first twelve months of operation regardless
of the licensee’s total monthly gross revenue. The licensee would be required to pay the City a
minimum annual tax of $1,200,000 regardless of revenues; and

d.	authorize the Council to adopt additional rules for the regulation of cardrooms.

Measure “A” would amend the Pittsburg General Plan land use map to change the land use

classification for the Site from Residential Medium Density to Community Commercial to
accommodate the Project. It would amend the Planned Development: Plan for the San Marco
subdivision to allow the Project on the Site, with conditions of approval which arc set forth in the
Measure.

Measure “A” would also amend the development agreement between the City and Scccon
(“Amendment”) authorizing Project construction on the Site and granting Seecon vested rights to
proceed with the Project in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Amendment.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF
CITY OF PITTSBURG
SPECIAL MEASURE A ELECTION
TUESDAY, APRIL 22,1997

Pittsburg’s Police Officers are asking the people of our community to be practical... Vote “YES” on
Measure A.

The San Marco Convention Center and card club will pay an average of $3 million each year to the
City of Pittsburg in taxes.

The card club will be taxed on each month’s gross revenues (not just profits) at a minimum rate of
10%, and as high as 15%. Also, regardless of revenues, the Council wisely established a SI ,200,000.00
per year minimum tax.

Today our $7 million police department budget allows for 72 officers.

Measure A will give the city enough money to improve public safety.

More officers in our schools.

More officers on patrol.

Modern equipment and better technology.

Repair our roads and improve traffic safety.

Increase our youth programs and prevent crime.

Proposition 13 in 1978 stopped property taxes from going up. Proposition 218 in 1996 prevents the
city from raising any other tax or fee.

That’s good news for us taxpayers.

But it makes it harder to maintain basic city services...and impossible to increase services.

The San Marco Convention Center and card club is not an ideal solution. But it is a practical solution
that works.

The opponents of Measure A are afraid that a card club will lower property values.

We say, “Property values will go up as we improve public safety and reduce crime. "

Sheriff Warren Rupf says:

“We currently have 5 licensed card rooms in the unincorporated portion of this County. We typically
do not experience any unusual statistical differences between card rooms and other businesses.”

Pittsburg Police Chief Willis Casey agrees:

“Please be assured that I totally concur with Sheriff Warren Rupfs comments...In addition our city-
ordinance allows for strict regulation of card rooms.”

The Pittsburg Police unanimously support Measure A.

SPECIAL MEASURE A ELECTION
TUESDAY, APRIL 22,1997

Pittsburg police officers arc urging our community to vote yes, but ask yourself the question WHY?

Our State Attorney General. FBI’s Chief of Organized Crime, the State Sheriffs Association &
countless other law enforcement agencies throughout California will tell you this industry is under-
regulated and a draw for crime. Out of 68 Pittsburg officers, only 12 live in our city. Thev do not raise
their children or do their grocers' shopping in our city.

The 311.2 million (minimum) in revenue that is proported is not guaranteed until after one year, and
after five years the 10% - 15% tax can be eliminated at the discretion of city council to remain
“competitive.”

Measure A will not guarantee increased police services. The police are budgeted for 72 officers, yet
employ only 68. At present funding we can and should have 4 additional officers on the beat.

New revenue will not be sufficient to protect the citizens from a decreased city image, increase in
crime, decrease in overall property values and other social & economic costs.

Proponents say that Proposition 218 prevents cities from raising taxes, but THAT’S NOT TRUE! The
proposition requires that the voters approve new taxes and fees.

It is said that the cardroom “is not the ideal solution”, but NOR IS IT PRACTICAL. Pittsburg citizens
should not be short-sighted to choose an impractical solution without looking at other options. Wc
cannot risk the reputation and character of our city w-ith die lure of easy money.

ARGUMENT AGAINST

SPECIAL MEASURE A ELECTION
TUESDAY, APRIL 22,1997

A casino will not bring the economic windfall proponents say it will, rather it will reduce the image
and quality of life that we and our families enjoy. The developer will have us believe the city will
receive millions of dollars, but what he doesn’t tell us about arc those hidden costs that we as taxpayers
will assume.

The developer will tell us that a casino is safer than a shopping mall, but do shopping malls increase
crimes such as narcotics 200%, traffic accidents 55%, property theft 83%, auto thefts 21% and
disorderly conduct 800%. This was experienced in San Jose from 8/93 to 9/94 as disclosed by the
city’s police chief. But San Jose is not the only city to see increases in crime, both state and local law
enforcement agencies have seen a jump in home/busincss invasion robberies, extortion, VIOLENT
loan sharking and employee/empioyer theft directly linked to cardrooms.

The developer will tell us that property values will not be affected; do you remember Keller Canyon
Landfill which the proponent has a financial interest. We have not experienced any positive effect from
the landfill nor will we see any positive effects from a cardroom. The only thing we face is increase
crime, lower property values and net loss of business to the city of Pittsburg.

Proponents claim the casino will bring in 525 jobs, but what is not said is the majority of these jobs
are low paying, low skilled with no family benefits, with no guarantee that the jobs will go to Pittsburg
citizens. These are not the types of jobs that make a community prosperous.

Why are these facilities coming to minority communities? The developer assume that we do not care
or know better.

Measure A imposes a Tax on the San Marco Convention Center and card room.

This card room tax will bring the City of Pittsburg an average of $3 million per year... money the
city will never get if Measure A is defeated.

5

The opponents insist on arguing that Measure A will increase crime...even though our police say
they are wrong.

They seem to be saying: “Don’t confuse us with the truth”

Sheriff Warren Rupf disagrees with them.

Police Chief Willis Casey disagrees with them.

Pittsburg’s Police Officers disagree with them.

Your choice is simple.

If you believe the Sheriff, the Chief and your local police officers...

Please vote YES on the card room tax.

More money for a safer community...

And Pittsburg’s taxpayers don’t pay any of it!
