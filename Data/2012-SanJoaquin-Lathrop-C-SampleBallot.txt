IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE C

CITY OF LATHROP LOCAL ONE PERCENT
TRANSACTIONS AND USE SALES TAX

Prepared by Lathrop City Attorney

This ballot measure, if approved by the voters, will generate
revenue that may be used by the City to pay for general City
operations and programs including public safety provided within
City limits for the benefit of City residents by the City or through
contract with such entities as the San Joaquin County Sheriff
Department and the Lathrop - Manteca Fire District. In addition,
the revenue generated by this measure may also be used by the
City to fund general government operations including street
maintenance and youth/senior services and programs. This ballot
measure proposes a “general purpose tax” rather than a “special
purpose tax” and therefore requires only a simple majority vote
for adoption (50% plus 1).

This ballot measure, if approved by the voters, will increase
the transactions and use sales tax rate by 1% from the current
rate 7.75% to 8.75%. The transactions and use tax increase
proposed by this ballot measure is permanent, with the one cent
increment specifically used for the local Lathrop community.

The proposed measure requires the City’s independent
auditors to complete a financial audit report to include the
revenue raised and expended by this measure. This measure
also requires an Independent Community Oversight Committee to
be established to review the expenditures of the revenue from
this transactions and use sales tax.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of the proposed
transactions and use tax increase Ordinance. If you desire a
copy of ordinance, please call the City Clerk’s office at (209) 941-
7230 and a copy will be mailed or electronically transmitted to you
at no cost to you.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE C

Did you know that Lathrop can no longer provide adequate
services without additional funding? Here are the FACTS:

•	There are more than 400 documented gang members and
gang associates in our community

•	Lathrop has 18% fewer police officers than the FBI
recommends for a city our size

•	Lathrop’s firefighter staffing levels are already below national
standards

•	One of only four local fire stations has been CLOSED

Do something about it! Vote YES on C to protect and maintain
police, fire and other essential services!

With recurring State budget deficits and Sacramento’s continual
raids on local funds, Lathrop could very well face severe cuts for
years to come. YES on C provides Lathrop with reliable local
funds to protect and maintain our community’s essential services
no matter what happens in Sacramento:

YES on C maintains police protection services and restores
police patrols

YES on C maintains 9-1-1 emergency response times

YES on C maintains firefighters and fire protection services

YES on C maintains rapid response to gang violence

YES on C helps prevent residential property and auto-related

crimes such as burglary and robbery

YES on C keeps our Senior and Community centers open to

serve the most vulnerable in our community

Without the funds generated by YES on C, Lathrop will
experience longer 9-1-1 response times. We need Measure C
funds to ensure that residents suffering from heart attacks,
strokes or other medical emergencies receive the immediate
attention they need, to survive.

Measure C includes tough fiscal accountability requirements such
as an Independent Citizens Oversight Committee and annual
independent audits. All audits will be published for the
community’s review. These fiscal safeguards will ensure funds
are spent as promised to you, the taxpayer.

Join Lathrop police officers, firefighters, youth advocates, seniors
and business leaders in supporting YES on C.
