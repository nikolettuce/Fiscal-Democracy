ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE F

This Measure increases an assessment begun in 1980, to
provide paramedic services. Approval must be by two-
thirds of those voting, every four years.

Our County Service Area No. 19 contracts with the San
Rafael City Fire Department to provide emergency med-
ical response in our unincorporated area.

This Measure does two things: (1) it increases the maxi-
mum annual assessment from the current $85 to $95 for
each household, and (2) increases the maximum tax, per
square foot for each non-residential structure, from the
current 11 cents to 13.2 cents per square foot.

For the past four years, the maximum rate per household
was $85. To account for future cost increases, this Mea-
sure provides the authority to increase the maximum
amount to $95 over four years. The actual rate is set by the
Board of Supervisors annually, determined by actual costs,
in negotiation with the City. The cost of service is deter-
mined by the number of households and commercial prop-
erties in the unincorporated area surrounding San Rafael.
Because the San Rafael Fire Department can leverage their
existing stations, vehicles, and expert personnel, they can
provide the best possible response time for medical emer-
gencies, and the highest quality of emergency medical care,
at lower cost than a private ambulance. The program is
designed to provide critical emergency services to all those
in need, regardless of ability to pay. If a resident of C.S.A.
19 called a private ambulance company the Basic Life
Support charge would be hundreds of dollars, plus supplies
and mileage charges. By comparison, the life-saving ser-
vice we receive from this Measure is a real bargain.

If this Measure does not pass, the City of San Rafael can
reduce the level of paramedic service to our community.
WE STRONGLY URGE YOU TO VOTE “YES” TO
MAINTAIN THIS CRITICAL SERVICE.
