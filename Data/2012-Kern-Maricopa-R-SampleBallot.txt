SAMPLE BALLC

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
CITY OF MARICOPA
MEASURE R

This ballot measure, if adopted by the voters, would enact a temporary ten-year
one-percent (1 %) increase to the sales tax rate in the City of Maricopa. The sales
tax is also referred to as a “transactions and use tax.” The current sales tax rate in
the City of Maricopa is seven and one-quarter percent (7.25%). Accordingly, if
this ballot measure is adopted, the sales tax rate would increase to eight and
one-quarter percent (8.25%) for the next ten years. The proposed increased sales
tax, like the current sales tax, would be imposed upon the sale of all tangible per-
sonal property sold at retail within the jurisdictional limits of the City of Maricopa as
well as upon the storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property
purchased from any retailer in the jurisdictional limits of the City of Maricopa.

All revenue generated from the proposed sales tax increase would become part of
the City of Maricopa’s General Fund which funds, among other things, public
safety, road repairs, park maintenance and other City services. As such, this bal-
lot measure proposes a “general purpose tax" rather than a “special purpose tax"
and only requires a majority vote for adoption.

FISCAL IMPACT BY CITY TREASURER
CITY OF MARICOPA *

MEASURE R

This ballot measure, if adopted by the voters, would enact a temporary ten-year
one-percent (1%) increase to the sales tax rate in the City of Maricopa. Audited re-
sults for Fiscal Year 2010 - 2011, the most recently completed audit, reflect sales
tax revenue of $22,537 which was approximately 9.25 percent of the city’s Gen-
eral Fund tax revenue in that year.

Adoption of the proposed measure is expected to double the city’s annual sales
tax revenue. Had the measure been in effect in Fiscal Year 2010-2011, the city’s
General Fund sales tax revenue would have been approximately $45,000.

Using Fiscal Year 2010 - 2011 figures, the one percent increase in the city sales
tax would result in additional General Fund sales tax revenue of $242,185 over the
ten year life of the tax.
