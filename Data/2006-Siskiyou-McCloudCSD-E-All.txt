A RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING AN ELECTION TO ESTABLISH
A MODIFIED SPECIAL TAX STRUCTURE AND RATE TO
FINANCE PARK AND RECREATION SERVICES
WHEREAS, the McCloud Community Services District is authorized
by California Government Code 61600 et seq. and its enabling
legislation to provide park and recreation services; and
WHEREAS, in a special election dated June 3, 1997, the voters
in McCloud approved a special parcel tax in the amount of $55.92
per year to fund park and recreation services; and
WHEREAS, since implementation of the park and recreation
special tax in 1997, the expenses of operating the park and recreation
services have exceeded revenues generated by the special tax by
an average of $5915.93 per year over the past nine years; and
WHEREAS, the District Board of Directors realizes that the District
cannot continue to fund, from District reserves, the expenses over
revenue from the Parks and Recreation Department; and
WHEREAS, the approved Long Range Planning Committee report
recommended replacing the existing special tax for park and
recreation services with a new special tax for park and recreation
services which would increase the rate of the tax. The committee
also recommended modifying the application of the new park and
recreation special tax to more closely reflect the actual benefit each
property receives for such services; and
WHEREAS, California Government Code Sections 53720 through
53730 and 53739 authorize the imposition of a special tax by a local
agency after voter approval pursuant to Article XIIIC and XIIID of

is not approved by 2/3 of the voters casting ballots at the November

of the McCloud Community Services District Board of Directors that
the following measure be placed on the ballot for vote in the general

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL
MEASURE E

McCLOUD COMMUNITY SERVICES DISTRICT
ADOPTION OF A SPECIAL TAX
(PARK AND RECREATION SERVICES)

The McCloud Community Services District is proposing a special
tax to be submitted to the voters in the McCloud Community Services
District. The measure, if approved by two-thirds of the electors voting
on the question, would authorize the McCloud Community Services
District to levy a special tax upon each parcel at rates depending
upon the classification of each parcel as defined in the resolution
adopted by the Board of Directors of the McCloud Community
Services District on June 12, 2006. This special tax, if approved by
the voters in the McCloud Community Services District, would replace
the special tax approved and enacted by the voters on June 3,1997
for park and recreation services; if this measure is not approved,
the special tax approved and enacted by the voters on June 3,1997
for park and recreation services would remain in full force and effect.
If this measure is approved, commencing with fiscal year 2007-2008,
the amount of the special tax would be Sixty Seven Dollars ($67,00)
per year for “undeveloped parcels”; Sixty Seven Dollars ($67.00) per
year for “single family residential”; One Hundred Thirty Four Dollars
($134.00) per year for “duplex or granny (residential)”; Sixty Seven
Dollars ($67.00) per year per dwelling unit for “multi-family residential”;
Sixty Seven Dollars ($67.00) per year for “commercial and industrial
(no living units or rental rooms)”; Sixty Seven Dollars ($67.00) per
year plus Sixty Seven Dollars ($67.00) per year for each living unit
for “commercial with living unit(s)”; Sixty Seven Dollars ($67.00) per
year plus Sixty Seven Dollars ($67.00) per year for each living unit
plus Sixteen and 75/100 Dollars ($16.75) per year for each rental
room or RV space for “commercial with living unit(s) and/or rental
rooms and/or RV spaces.”

If confirmed by the voters, the special tax would be levied effective
July 1, 2007. The tax would be collected at the same time and in
the same manner as ordinary County property taxes are collected
and would be subject to the same penalties and procedures in the
case of delinquency.

The special tax would be levied to establish a source of funds
so that the McCloud Community Services District could provide and
maintain park and recreation services for the health, welfare, and
benefit of the McCloud community. The funds could not be used for
any other purposes.

A “yes” vote favors passage of the special tax; a “no” vote is
against the passage of the special tax.
