The Top Two Candidates Open Primary Act, which took effect January 1, 2011, requires that all candidates for a voter-nominated
office be listed on the same ballot. Voter-nominated offices are state legislative offices, U.S. congressional offices, and state
constitutional offices.

In both the open primary and general elections, you can vote for any candidate, regardless of what party preference you indicated
on your voter registration form. In the primary election, the two candidates receiving the most votes—regardless of party
preference—move on to the general election regardless of vote totals. If a candidate receives a majority of the vote (50 percent +
1), a general election still must be held. Even if there are only two candidates for an office in the open primary, a general election
for that office is still required.

California’s open primary system does not apply to candidates running for local offices.

Voter-Nominated Offices

Political parties are not entitled to formally nominate candidates for voter-nominated offices at the primary election. A
candidate nominated for a voter-nominated office at the primary election is the nominee of the people and not the official nominee
of any party at the general election. A candidate for nomination to a voter-nominated office shall have his or her party preference,
or lack of party preference, stated on the ballot, but the party preference designation is selected solely by the candidate and is
shown for the information of the voters only. It does not mean the candidate is nominated or endorsed by the party designated,
or that there is an affiliation between the party and candidate, and no candidate nominated by the voters shall be deemed to be
the officially nominated candidate of any political party. In the county sample ballot booklet, parties may list the candidates for
voter-nominated offices who have received the party’s official endorsement.

Any voter may vote for any candidate for a voter-nominated office, if they meet the other qualifications required to vote
for that office. The top two vote-getters at the primary election move on to the general election for the voter-nominated office even
if both candidates have specified the same party preference designation. No party is entitled to have a candidate with its party
preference designation move on to the general election, unless the candidate is one of the two highest vote-getters at the primary
election.

Nonpartisan State Offices

Political parties are not entitled to nominate candidates for nonpartisan offices at the primary election, and a candidate
at the primary election is not the official nominee of any party for the specific office at the general election. A candidate for
nomination to a nonpartisan office may not designate his or her party preference, or lack of party preference, on the ballot. The
top two vote-getters at the primary election move on to the general election for the nonpartisan office.

New electoral district boundaries are drawn every 10 years in order to equalize district populations. Boundaries for the
congressional, state legislative, and county supervisorial districts are now different. Boundary changes also apply to any city,
school district, or special district that votes by trustee areas or divisions. To see the new district maps, visit the Registrar of
Voters website at www.voteinfo.net.

CANDIDATE STATEMENT FOR
UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE,

36TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT

BRIAN NESTANDE, Republican	AGE:	50

OCCUPATION:	State Assemblyman / Businessman

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

Congress isn’t getting anything done, and the current Congress is
one of history's worst.

In Congress, I'll work to:

S Immediately secure the border as the FIRST step in immigration
reform

s STOP the overspending and pass a balanced budget
amendment

s Hold Congress accountable - no balanced budget = no
paycheck

s Create policies that encourage businesses to expand so we
have high quality good paying jobs

Middle class families cannot afford another do-nothing Congress. In
the last two years, Congress sent America another $2 trillion deeper
into debt - an amount equal to an additional $9,000 of debt per U.S.
taxpayer.

At the same time, the cost of healthcare under Obamacare has risen
by as much as fifty percent, and millions of seniors have seen their
Medicare benefits reduced.

Worker wages have remained stagnant, and more businesses are
moving off-shore as Congress debates adding even higher taxes and
more regulations.

My wife Gina and I are raising our family and we know first-hand how
difficult Washington is making it for middle class families to get ahead.

I’ll make sure the priorities of seniors and middle-class families
are put into action, and that's the difference. That’s why I’ve been
endorsed by most of the local elected leaders in our District - people
who understand how difficult it’s been to have a voice in Congress. I
would be honored to have your vote.

CANDIDATE STATEMENT FOR
MEMBER OF THE STATE ASSEMBLY,

42ND ASSEMBLY DISTRICT

CHAD MAYES, Republican	AGE:	37

OCCUPATION:	Chief	of	Staff

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

The past few months have been some of the most satisfying times of
my life in public service.

I have become reacquainted with old friends and have had the
chance to meet and visit with neighbors from across our district and
from all political parties. Together, we’ve discussed the issues facing
California and shared our hopes for our region. I can say without
hesitation that I’ve listened and learned from each one of those
conversations.

Like many, I’m frustrated with Sacramento’s lack of progress on job
creation, better schools, and safe communities - important priorities
that have fallen victim to partisan politics.

With a servant’s heart, I’ll work to end partisan bickering in
Sacramento. I’ll work with both Democrats and Republicans to make
government accountable, protect taxpayers by defending Proposition
13, strengthen our economy, and provide the outstanding education
our children deserve.

With your trust, I’m prepared to get the job done.

I’m honored to have earned the endorsement of Congressman Paul
Cook, every Member of the Riverside County Board of Supervisors,
the Riverside County Sheriffs’ Association, CAL FIRE, the Howard
Jarvis Taxpayers Association, and dozens of local elected officials.
To be honest, the support that matters most is yours.

As you consider whom to support, please know that I would be
honored to have your vote. If you have questions about where
I stand on the issues, call me at (760) 413-9048 or email me at
Chad@ChadMayes.com and I’ll respond personally.

CANDIDATE STATEMENT FOR
MEMBER OF THE STATE ASSEMBLY,

42ND ASSEMBLY DISTRICT

KARALEE HARGROVE, Democratic	AGE:	32

OCCUPATION:	School Board Trustee

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

California faces challenges. Challenges expose opportunities. My
background and experience qualifies me to nurture California’s
opportunities.

As a Morongo Unified School Board Trustee I know that vigorous
education is essential to cultivating critical thinking skills and
creativity. Creative minds incubate innovative solutions for California’s
challenges.

Every student need not attend college. In addition to math and
science, students need opportunities to learn skilled trades, arts, and
music. Preschools significantly jump-start good learning skills.

Independent and innovative thinking, rather than political
stubbornness, fosters representative government. Some things are
best solved on a large coordinated scale, others locally. I reach out
to others who consider the impact on whole communities not just on
legislation benefiting narrow special interests. Ours is a community
of diverse needs.

I will listen, learn, and act, by initiating and supporting State policies
that reflect the realistic aspirations of the 42nd Assembly district.

As a wife, mother of five children, school board member, and student
I relate to everyday real life challenges. My school board record
reflects my dedication to excellence.

As an elected woman, the gender gap could narrow in the legislature.
This is good for truly representative government.

I ask for your vote so we all win.

MT. SAN JACINTO COLLEGE AFFORDABLE EDUCATION AND JOB TRAINING MEASURE. “To expand college buildings serving four-year
university transfer, veterans’ education, and career training, by expanding career/support facilities for veterans/military, ensuring buildings are
accessible for the disabled, upgrading nursing, emergency responder, criminal justice, vocational job training classrooms, updating science labs,
electrical systems, technology infrastructure, acquiring, constructing, and repairing classrooms, facilities, sites/equipment, shall Mt. San Jacinto

Bonds - Yes

Bonds - No

PROJECTS

The Board of Trustees of the Mt. San Jacinto Community College District, to be responsive to the needs of its community, evaluated Mt. San
Jacinto College’s urgent and critical facility needs, and its capacity to provide students, active military and Veterans with support facilities, an
affordable education and prepare them for success in college and careers. Safety issues, enrollmentgrowth, class size reduction and class offerings,
and information and computer technology infrastructure were each considered, in developing the scope of projects to be funded, as outlined in the
District’s Master Facility Plan, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety (the “Master Plan”), and available for review on the District’s website
(www.msi.edu1. In developing the scope of projects, the faculty, staff, students and community have prioritized providing essential job training
and workforce preparation skills students need to succeed in today’s competitive job market, and ensuring buildings are accessible for the
disabled, and facilities available to support an affordable education, so that the most critical needs that will make the Mt. San Jacinto College an
effective place for learning, would be addressed. In the course of developing the Master Plan, public input was received from hundreds of constituents.
It was concluded that if these facility needs were not addressed now, the Mt. San Jacinto College would be unable to remain competitive in preparing
students for jobs in high demand industries and university transfer. The Board concluded that the longer they waited to repair and upgrade Mt. San
Jacinto College, the more expensive it would be. In implementing the Master Plan the Board of Trustees determines that Mt. San Jacinto
College MUST:

(i)	Expand career and SUPPORT FACILITIES FOR VETERANS and military personnel;

(ii)	Increase workforce preparation skills students need to succeed in today’s job market;

(iii)	Ensure BUILDINGS are ACCESSIBLE FOR THE DISABLED;

(iv)	Provide AFFORDABLE, LOW-COST, HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION in San Jacinto, Menifee Valley, San Gorgonio and

Temecula, needed to successfully transfer to four-year universities; and

(v)	Qualify the College for any available State matching funds; and

(vi)	Ensure that the College has the capacity and high quality classrooms and facilities to meet academic needs and

demands of its regional students; and

(vii)	Adhere to stringent FISCAL ACCOUNTABILITY safeguards including:

(a)	REQUIRE ANNUAL FINANCIAL AUDITS,

(b)	Require citizens’ oversight of all funds,

(c)	No funds will be used for administrators’ salaries and pensions,

(d)	ALL FUNDS WILL BE SUBJECT TO LOCAL CONTROL AND WILL REMAIN LOCAL IN MT. SAN JACINTO COLLEGE.

The Master Plan is available for review at the Superintendent/President’s office and at www.msi.edu. The following types of projects are
authorized to be undertaken at Mt. San Jacinto College facilities in Menifee, Temecula, San Jacinto, San Gorgonio, as well as at a to be constructed
technology campus in the Interstate 15 corridor:

Academic Facility and Technology Upgrade Projects to Help Students
and Veterans be Trained for Good Jobs

Goal and Purpose: Because it is extremely hard to get a job in today’s economy, Mt. San Jacinto College must provide the essential
job training and workforce preparation skills students need to succeed in to today’s highly competitive job market. This measure will
expand local education in nursing, science, technology, engineering and math to meet the needs of our local, regional employers and
help attract more high paying jobs and businesses to our region.

33-9008-M5

RV 098-014

Mt. San Jacinto College has served thousands of military veterans, many who have recently returned from war zones and face
challenges including post-traumatic stress disorder and permanent disabilities. The College is a national leader in helping returning
veterans reintegrate with their education and careers, and this measure will upgrade and expand veteran services and job training so
returning service members receive the support they need to complete their education and enter the civilian workforce.

Thus the District requires FUNDS that ARE LOCALLY CONTROLLED to improve academic facilities and technology implementations
which will allow them to continue providing ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE, HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION to local students, active military
and veterans, including:

•	Upgrade and expand facilities for career training in well-paying careers and transfer to universities.

•	Expand course opportunities to increase enrollment, classrooms and instructional facilities in nursing, emergency responder, criminal
justice, vocational job training classrooms, and other core academic classes.

•	Expand facilities for veterans to provide career training and support services to returning veterans seeking training or
retraining to reenter the workforce.

•	Upgrade outdated science, math and computer labs and expand College facilities providing instruction in Science, Technology,
Engineering and Math (STEM).

•	Install additional technology infrastructure to improve computer technology and Internet access.

•	Upgrade outdated job-training classrooms, labs and equipment to provide all students with opportunities to learn job skills.

•	Upgrade support facilities for currently active military personnel.

•	Upgrade and replace existing information technology infrastructure and network systems to improve efficiency and increase capacity.

•	Upgrade and expand telecommunications, Internet and network connections.

•	Upgrade and build academic buildings to expand classrooms for career training in science, medical, public safety and other in-demand
jobs.

•	Upgrade and replace technology, computers, hardware and systems used for job training and retraining programs.

Repair and Construction Projects to
Provide Greater Access to an Affordable Education

Goal and Purpose:	Since the cost of attending a public university has risen to as much as six (6) times that of attending Mt. San

Jacinto College, students rely on Mt. San Jacinto to save as much as $35,000 in tuition on their way to a four-year degree. Therefore,
keeping Mt. San Jacinto’s facilities upgraded will best serve all local students, military and veterans who can earn college credits,
certificates and job skills at a reasonable price:

♦	ENSURE BUILDINGS ARE ACCESSIBLE FOR THE DISABLED.

♦	Upgrade aging roofs, bathrooms and disabled accessibility, repair floors, walkways, lighting and electrical systems.

♦	Construct more classroom space.

♦	Remove asbestos.

♦	Upgrade campus facilities to provide improved access, including road and parking upgrades to improve safety, access and traffic flow.

♦	Improve heating, ventilation, insulation, doors, lighting, and windows to increase energy efficiency and save money.

♦	Upgrade outdated electrical systems and wiring for computer technology and Internet access.

♦	Renovate, repair or replace outdated laboratories, classrooms, training centers and support facilities.

♦	Upgrade and replace classroom instructional equipment.

♦	Improve student safety, emergency preparedness, and security systems, including lighting, fencing, smoke detectors, fire alarms and
sprinklers, gas and sewer lines.

endowment, LCD projectors, portable interface devices, servers, switches, routers, modules, sound projection systems, information systems,
printers, digital white boards, upgrade voice-over-IP, communication systems, call manager and network security/firewalI, Internet connectivity,
wireless systems, technology infrastructure, and other miscellaneous equipment and software.

The allocation of bond proceeds will be affected by the District’s receipt of State matching funds and the final costs of each project. In the
absence of State matching funds, which the District will aggressively pursue to reduce the District’s share of the costs of the projects, the District
will not be able to complete some of the projects listed above. Some projects, such as physical education facilities, may be undertaken as joint use
projects in cooperation with other local public or non-profit agencies. The budget for each project is an estimate and may be affected by factors
beyond the District’s control. The final cost of each project will be determined as plans and construction documents are finalized, construction
bids are received, construction contracts are awarded and projects are completed. Based on the final costs of each project, certain of the projects
described above may be delayed or may not be completed. Demolition of existing facilities and reconstruction of facilities scheduled for repair and
upgrade may occur, if the Board determines that such an approach would be more cost-effective in creating more enhanced and operationally
efficient campuses. Necessary site preparation/restoration may occur in connection with new construction, renovation or remodeling, or installation
or removal of relocatable classrooms, including ingress and egress, removing, replacing, or installing irrigation, utility lines, trees and landscaping,
relocating fire access roads, and acquiring any necessary easements, licenses, or rights of way to the property. Proceeds of the bonds may be
used to pay or reimburse the District for the cost of District staff when performing work on or necessary and incidental to bond projects. Bond
proceeds shall only be expended for the specific purposes identified herein. The District shall create an account into which proceeds of the bonds
shall be deposited and comply with the reporting requirements of Government Code § 53410.

MEASURE “AA” - MT. SAN JACINTO COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT

Mt. San Jacinto Community College District
2014 Bond Election
Tax Rate Statement

An election will be held in the Mt. San Jacinto Community District (the “District”) on November 4,2014, to authorize the sale of up to $295,000,000
in bonds of the District to finance facilities as described in the proposition. If the bonds are approved, the District expects to issue the Bonds in
multiple series over time. Principal and interest on the bonds will be payable from the proceeds of tax levies made upon the taxable property in the
District. The following information is provided in compliance with Sections 9400 through 9404 of the California Elections Code.

1.	The best estimate of the tax which would be required to be levied to fund this bond issue during the first fiscal year after the sale of the first series
of bonds, based on estimated assessed valuations available at the time of filing of this statement, is $0.01320 per $100 ($13.20 per $100,000) of
assessed valuation in fiscal year 2015-16.

2.	The best estimate of the tax rate which would be required to be levied to fund this bond issue during the first fiscal year after the sale of the
last series of bonds, based on estimated assessed valuations available at the time of filing of this statement, is $0.01320 per $100 ($13.20 per
$100,000) of assessed valuation in fiscal year 2024-25.

3.	The best estimate of the highest tax rate which would be required to be levied to fund this bond issue, based on estimated assessed valuations
available at the time of filing of this statement, is $0.01320 per $100 ($13.20 per $100,000) of assessed valuation, which is projected to be the same
in every fiscal year that the bonds remain outstanding.

Voters should note that estimated tax rates are based on the ASSESSED VALUE of taxable property on the County’s official tax rolls, not on the
property’s market value, which could be more or less than the assessed value. In addition, taxpayers eligible for a property tax exemption, such as
the homeowner's exemption, will be taxed at a lower effective tax rate than described above. Certain taxpayers may also be eligible to postpone
payment of taxes. Property owners should consult their own property tax bills and tax advisors to determine their property's assessed value and
any applicable tax exemptions.

Attention of all voters is directed to the fact that the foregoing information is based upon the District’s projections and estimates only, which are not
binding upon the District. The actual tax rates and the years in which they will apply may vary from those presently estimated, due to variations
from these estimates in the timing of bond sales, the amount of bonds sold and market interest rates at the time of each sale, and actual assessed
valuations over the term of repayment of the bonds. The dates of sale and the amount of bonds sold at any given time will be determined by the
District based on need for construction funds and other factors. The actual interest rates at which the bonds will be sold will depend on the bond
market at the time of each sale. Actual future assessed valuation will depend upon the amount and value of taxable property within the District as
determined by the County Assessor in the annual assessment and the equalization process.

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE “AA”

The Board of Trustees (“Board”) of the Mt. San Jacinto Community College (“District”) by adopting Resolution No. 2014/15-001 (“Resolution”),
elected to call an election pursuant to Section 18 of Article XVI and Section 1 of Article XI11A of the California Constitution and Section 15100 and
15624 etseq. of the California Education Code to obtain authorization to issue and sell general obligation Bonds (“Bonds”) in the aggregate amount
principal amount of two hundred and ninety-five millions dollars ($295,000,000).

This Measure was placed on the ballot by the Board of the above-identified District.

The Bonds would be used by the District to repair and upgrade campus facilities for career technical education, upgrade classrooms to support
programs for veterans and active military personnel, repair and renovate infrastructure to allow access to the disabled, repair, update and modernize
infrastructure, including technology, plumbing, electrical, parking and security. The Bonds would not be used to fund the salaries, pensions or
benefits of any board members, administrator, and/or teachers or for other school operating expenses.

If Measure “AA” is approved, the Board of the District will appoint a citizens’ oversight committee and conduct annual independent audits to assure
that bond funds are spent only on the construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation, or replacement of school facilities, including the furnishing and
equipping of school facilities, or the acquisition or lease of real property for school facilities, and for no other purposes.

An ad valorem tax would be levied and collected on property within the boundaries of the District to pay the principal and interest on the Bonds.

The Resolution provides that the maximum interest rate on the Bonds will not exceed the maximum interest rate permitted by the applicable laws
of the State and the maximum term of the Bonds, or any series thereof, will not exceed 40 years.

Approval of Measure “AA” does not guarantee that the proposed project or projects in the Mt. San Jacinto Community College District that are the
subject of the Bonds under Measure “AA” will be funded beyond the local revenues generated by Measure “AA”. The District’s proposal for the
project or projects may assume the receipt of matching state funds, which could be subject to appropriation by the Legislature or approval of a
statewide bond measure.

For this Measure to be approved fifty-five percent (55%) of qualified voters who vote on the Measure must vote yes.

A “YES” vote on Measure “AA” is a vote to allow the District to sell the Bonds and levy the necessary taxes to pay for the Bonds.

A “NO” vote on Measure “AA” is a vote against allowing the District to sell the Bonds and levy the necessary taxes to pay for the Bonds.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE “AA”

In the last four years, the state has cut millions of dollars from Mt. San
Jacinto Community College. We won’t stand for this, and can’t rely on
Sacramento politicians to help our local colleges—vote YES on “AA”!

Do you think it’s difficult to get a job in today’s slowly recovering
economy? We sure do! Vote YES on “AA” to expand essential
job training and workforce preparation skills in nursing, science,
technology, engineering and math to meet the needs of our local,
regional employers. A skilled workforce helps attract more high paying
jobs and businesses to our region.

YES on “AA” ensures that our tax dollars stay local to address our
area’s educational and job training needs. Sacramento is legally
prohibited from taking Measure “AA” funds!

YES on “AA” helps provide job training and education for our returning
military veterans. It is shameful how the federal government is treating
our war veterans. Mt. San Jacinto College is a national leader in helping
returning veterans reintegrate with their education and careers. It
upgrades and expands veteran services and job training so returning
veterans receive the support they need to complete their education and
enter the civilian workforce.

YES on “AA” will:

•	Improve our nationally-recognized, award-winning education
by expanding our transfer preparation and career training
opportunities/increasing partnerships with area employers to
fill local job training needs

•	Benefit students from EVERY region in the District

•	Double the college's student capacity

•	Upgrade leaky roofs and bathrooms

•	Upgrade outdated nursing labs, paramedic, 9-1-1, law enforcement
and job training classrooms

•	Ensure disabled accessibility

YES on “AA”'s strict Fiscal Accountability requirements include an
expanded Independent Citizens’ Oversight Committee and annual
financial audits ensuring money is spent as promised. No money will go
towards salaries or pensions and ALL money will stay local to address
our region’s education and job training needs.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE “AA”

While StateFunding was curtailed following the “Great Recession,”
Bond Proponents Falsely Argue that MSJC received only cuts during
the past 4 years. Rather, the 2014-15 State Budget increases Funding
by almost $1 Billion, or about 11 Percent over the previous year. “I’m
calling it a Grand Slam,” said Scott Lay, President of the Community
College League of California, a Nonprofit Association for Community
College Districts Statewide. “It freezes tuition and brings us back to the
Funding Levels of 2007-2008.” Budget Increases Include:

•	$155.2	Million	to fund a 3 percent restoration of access allowing

Colleges to add approximately 70,000 students.

•	$48.5	Million	to	fund a Cost of Living Adjustment of 0.86 percent.

•	$175	Million	for deferred maintenance and instructional

equipment.

•	$235.6 Million reduction in payment deferrals, combined with
$356.8 million proposed in one-time funds for this purpose.

•	$39	Million	in	Proposition 39 funds for energy efficiency and

workforce development projects.

•	$2.5	Million	for local technical assistance supporting

implementation of effective student success practices, with
priority placed on underperforming districts.

•	$1.1	Million	and nine new Chancellor’s Office positions to

develop student success indicators and monitor College/District
performance.

•	$50	Million	in	one-time	funding for incentive awards recognizing

models of innovation in Higher Education.

•	NO student fee increase for the 2014-15 Academic Year.

State Funding is Rebounding to Pre-Recession Levels. It’s the WRONG
time to Burden Locals with More Debt and Higher Taxes. Please Vote
NO on Measure “AA”

A vote in favor of this Controversial Bond Measure means Higher
Taxes. Measure “AA” means that WE Assume the Obligation to
Repay $Millions of Dollars in Debt issued on behalf of Mt. San Jacinto
Community College - in addition to Interest and Debt Servicing - which
makes Payback on Bonds as high as VA to 2 times the Original Debt.
So although MSJC will have roughly $300 $Million to Spend, the Money
WE are Obligated to Repay could reach nearly $600 $Million - which
Bottom Line remains Unknown because MSJC Neglects to Disclose
specifics of this ‘Minor’ detail. Bond issuers and Wall Street types are
Salivating over Stuffing their pockets full of Your Cash.

Measure “AA” also means OUR Homes become Collateral for
Repayment of these Bonds. Bond Holders gain a legal Right to
Foreclose and Auction off OUR Homes to Secure Debt Payments
in event of Default. So if You become short on Funds and choose
“Extravagances” such as food, clothing, health care, rent, car payments
or gasoline over Repaying MSJC’s Bond, You will risk Foreclosure
and having Your Home Sold off at a Public Auction to Repay Bonded
Indebtedness.

Measure “AA” is swirling in Controversy even before ink dries on the
ballots. The MSJC Board of Trustees could Not even reach a consensus
on their Decision to load You Down with more Debt. The vote was 4-1,
with Trustee Eugene Kadow voting NO on Bonds.

MSJC is among the Lowest performing Junior Colleges Statewide.
They manage resources Poorly and have left $Millions in State Funding
on the table by Failing to increase Class Sections. Now they want You
to Backfill their Underperformance with Bonds - Adding ways for You
to Lose your $Money and Possibly even Your Home. Enough is enough.

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE “CC”

On August 5, 2014, the City Council placed Measure "CC" on the
November 4, 2014 ballot. If approved by a majority of San Jacinto
voters, this Measure would authorize a six and one-half percent (6.5%)
utility users tax on the use of telecommunications, water, gas, electricity,
cable/video, sewer and refuse services within the City of San Jacinto.

The tax proposed by Measure “CC” is temporary and will automatically
expire 10 years after its effective date. Measure “CC” would exempt
households with low-income seniors (62 or older) and authorizes the
City Council to exempt additional persons or services from the tax in
the future.

Measure “CC” is intended to prevent significant cuts to general City
services resulting from revenue shortfalls caused by recent economic
factors. This tax would be a “general tax,” meaning that revenues raised
from the tax would go into the City’s general fund to fund any lawful
City program, improvement, or service. The City would not be required
to use the revenues raised by Measure “CC” for any special purpose
or for any particular program or service. All revenues raised by the tax
would belong to the City and would not be shared with the State or any
other agency.

Measure “CC” would require that the City annually verify that the tax
has been properly applied, collected and spent according to applicable
law through an independent third-party audit, the results of which shall
be published in an annual expenditure report.

Measure “CC” would authorize the City Council to adjust the rate of the
utility users tax up or down as appropriate to the financial condition of
the City, without voter approval, provided the rate does not exceed the
maximum 6.5% set forth in the Measure.

If approved, the utility users tax would be collected starting on or
about March 1, 2015. By placing Measure “CC” on the ballot, the City
complies with Article XI11C of the California Constitution (Proposition
218), which requires a majority of the voters to approve an ordinance
which establishes a general tax.

A “yes” vote on Measure “CC” will authorize the utility users tax.

A “no” vote on Measure “CC” will not authorize the utility users tax.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure “CC”.
If you desire a copy of the Measure, please call the elections
official’s office at (951) 487-7339 and a copy will be mailed at no
cost to you.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE “CC”

Vote YES on Measure “CC” to maintain and restore police, fire and
emergency services.

Public Safety is the most important service. San Jacinto policing levels
are already 20% below the standard due to growth. Home invasions,
homicides, gang activity, and crimes targeting seniors are up. County
prisons are full resulting in the release of 23,560 inmates, and increasing
the City’s police calls by 40%.

The City cannot continue to spend more money on public safety than
its revenues. San Jacinto could eliminate everything from the budget
except public safety and there would still be a deficit. Over 80% of the
general fund is spent on police and fire services. Without Measure
“CC”, approximately 25% of the police, one School Resource Officer,
all traffic patrols and one fire station will be eliminated.

It is an income problem, not a spending problem. Since 2007-2008,
Sacramento raided the City revenue by over $3.7 million, taking over
40% the City’s property tax revenues. Between this and “The “Great
Recession” the City was forced to balance the budget using reserve
funds. San Jacinto has cut 23% of an already lean staff, lowered interest
payments on loans, reduced utility costs, eliminated special events and
passed pension reform requiring employee retirement contributions.

Measure “CC” will provide the revenue needed to not only maintain the
current public safety levels, but will increase the policing levels to match
our population growth. These funds will be safe from Sacramento and
the County. Measure “CC” will require independent audits, exempt low
income seniors, and will sunset after 10 years.

Measure “CC” is endorsed by The San Jacinto Chamber of Commerce,
The Hemet/San Jacinto Chamber of Commerce, educators, all 5
council members, and community leaders because they know Measure
“CC” will protect businesses, schools and our entire community.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE “CC”

All we need is basic common sense and responsible leadership with
common sense budget decisions. The budget could balance if the City
Council reduced expenses and made appropriate changes. The San
Jacinto Police Department has always had the current staffing levels
for the last four years. The City Council had knowledge and continued
to spend the general fund reserves to balance the budget for four
years. This City Council continued to spend; now they want to tax
you so they can continue to spend more. This City Council has been
fiscally irresponsible. Why should San Jacinto residents, businesses,
and consumers be penalized because the City Council refused to stop
spending? It is very clear that the City Council knew that Sacramento
would raid City revenues. The City Council continued to spend our
general fund reserves. Why can’t the City Council live within its means?
Why do the residents, businesses, and consumers of San Jacinto
have to bail them out? Haven’t we had enough of political bailouts?
Measure “CC” Utility tax funds are not protected from Sacramento. The
City Council can use this revenue any way they choose. Measure “CC”
utility tax funds are considered general fund revenues. Measure “CC”
utility tax funds might cover the deficit only and not provide additional
revenue or police to the City. Measure “CC” utility tax will hurt San
Jacinto residents, consumers, and businesses. We will lose more jobs
and future jobs in this city. Vote NO on Measure “CC”!

Taxpayers Against Measure “CC”

Here we go again with another new tax increase on the ballot, and this
one is unnecessary and unfair. The current City Council for the past two
years has been fiscally irresponsible and has not been good stewards
of the City's assets and services. The City Council approved placing the
measure on the ballot 5-0. They are a tax and spend council.

Measure “CC” will apply a 6.5% tax to your electric, gas, water, phone,
cell phone and internet bills. Your “NO” VOTE on “MEASURE CC” will
save you thousands of dollars over the next ten years on user utility
tax for all utilities. This tax has a sunset clause of ten years. Do you
really think this tax would be a “TEMPORARY TAX?” This tax will
automatically increase as utility rates increase for San Jacinto residents
and businesses. This 6.5% tax could cost an average household about
$400.00 a year or more and for businesses substantially more. Contrary
to what the City Council claims, the tax DOES NOT indicate whether it
is designated or restricted for Public Safety or for a specific benefit for
the San Jacinto Taxpayers.

Some homeowners will be double taxed because of Community
Facilities District taxes where they pay for public safety already. For
example a property owner in San Jacinto who already pays $3,484.46
per year for Community Facilities District public safety taxes will now
add on 6.5% utility tax or about $400. For electricity alone, a restaurant
in San Jacinto that pays $8,000.00 per month would have to pay $6,240
more per year. This will cost us jobs!

“VOTE NO” on Measure “CC”.

James D. Pangrazzi, Retired Professional Driver
Michael Fred Allen, Retired Teacher

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE “CC”

The small group opposed to Measure “CC” is composed of failed
politicians who want to blame others, but offer no solutions of their
own to preserve basic public safety services. Instead, they throw out
inaccurate and downright deceptive numbers designed to scare voters.

The truth is we have a revenue problem, not a spending problem. City
revenues have declined because of the recession and seizure of local
funds by the state to relieve their budget problems. Current revenues
are not even enough to cover the cost of public safety. Even if every
city employee and manager were fired, San Jacinto would still have a
budget deficit.

The current City Council has been fiscally conservative, reducing city
staff by 23%, reforming employee pensions, and cutting the city budget
by an average of $9.5 million over the past two-years. Any further cuts
would drastically reduce the level of public safety in our city.

State mandated prison realignment forced the release of 23,560
inmates into Riverside County. As a result we’ve seen a surge in home
invasions, gang activity, and crimes targeting seniors. Our city cannot
afford any further cuts to public safety.

The San Jacinto City Council, the Chamber of Commerce, and San
Jacinto taxpayers all support Measure “CC” because revenues will stay
in San Jacinto and cannot be seized by the state or county. Measure
“CC” will stabilize our city budget, improve public safety, and make San
Jacinto a safer, more attractive place to live and work.
