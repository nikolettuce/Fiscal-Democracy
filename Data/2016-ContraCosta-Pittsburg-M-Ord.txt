BEFORE THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY OF PITTSBURG

In the Matter of:

An Ordinance of the City of Pittsburg	)

Continuing and Extending the General )

Transaction and Use Tax to Fund General )	ORDINANCE NO. 16-1411

Municipal Services and to be Administered )
bv the State Board of Equalization________)

Now therefore, the People of the City of Pittsburg, DO ORDAIN as follows:

SECTION 1.

A.	The City of Pittsburg has faced decreasing revenues, including a twenty-six percent
decrease, in sales and property taxes since 2008, amounting to a loss of approximately
$2.6 million, and costs of providing essential city services to residents continue to
increase.

B.	The national and state recession has resulted in a weak economy best evidenced
by several years of declining development activity revenue, significant decreases in
property and transfer tax revenues, raids on City revenues by the State of California,
increased retirement costs and increased insurance costs.

C.	The City has taken steps to increase revenue and decrease expenditures, including
but not limited to, updating charges for services in order to ensure that users are paying for
their fair share of costs. Despite these measures, however, it is expected that the City’s
General Fund will continue to decline.

D.	The City has cut funding to community events, capped contributions to employees’
medical insurance premiums and provides reduced retirement benefits to new employees
in an effort to minimize expenses.

E.	In an attempt to reduce costs, the fiscal year 2011-12 budget called for leaving four
(4) police department positions vacant, eliminating funding for police and maintenance
employees at City events, and eight (8) layoffs that resulted from eliminating approximately
(14) positions.

F.	Without increased revenues the City will have to further cut programs, including a
reduction in police services, cuts to senior services, code enforcement and other vital
community services necessary for the preservation of public peace, health and safety.

G.	The City is committed to maintaining public safety, including gang enforcement and
code enforcement, and does not want to make further cuts to community services,
including the Senior Center.

H.	This measure would create a guaranteed local source of funding for public safety in
order to avoid cuts to other important services offered by the City. All funds from a local
measure must stay in Pittsburg to maintain local services, and the funds cannot be taken

by the State. A local increase in the Sales Transaction and Use Tax would ensure fiscal
accountability to maintain local services and would be reported on annually to the City
Council.
