SAMPLE BALLOT

Measure K
May 3, 2005

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF

Due to increasing costs for labor and materials, we are unable to maintain the road
system within the Ryan Ranch Road Zone of Benefit at its current level and afford
regular road and drainage maintenance, brush and tree removal, weed abatement and
other projects annually.

This issue was discussed at our annual Zone meeting. In order to raise our assessment
in the most economical way your advisory committee is requesting your vote for a
special tax to replace the existing benefit assessment. This ballot measure requests
approval of a special tax of $600.00 per year, with the promise of the Advisory
Committee, that it will be levied at $500 per parcel for the 05/06 fiscal year. It should be
stated that at the annual meeting of the zone of benefit January 31, 2005 the property
owners in attendance voted to increase the assessment for the 05/06 Fiscal Year to
$500 per parcel by unanimous vote.

By setting the special tax at $600.00 your Advisory Committee believes it will not be
necessary to increase the tax above this amount for at least six to nine years. As the
Advisory Committee determines the level of maintenance necessary each year to
maintain the road system, the parcels owners at the annual meeting can adjust the per
parcel assessment for the roads up or down as needed within the $600 per parcel
(framework. A special tax assures the property owner that the tax can not be increased
above $600.00 per year unless another election is held and passed by a 2/3 vote.
