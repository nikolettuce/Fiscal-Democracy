Impartial Analysis of Measure B

Measure B would extend the City's existing special parcel tax. The special parcel tax was first adopted by
the voters in 2007. The tax was readopted by the voters in 2012. The 2012 tax is due to expire, and will
no longer be collected after June 2018.

Measure B would continue the parcel tax until repealed by a vote of the people. The actual rate will be
set each year by the City Council, but could not exceed the current flat rate of $150 per lot or parcel. In
other words, in any given year the Council could charge $0 per parcel, $150 per parcel, or any amount in
between.

This Measure does not include any escalation for inflation.

The tax would potentially generate $7.5 million annually. However, because of the history of
delinquencies, the City anticipates the tax revenue would be approximately $6 million annually. The City
Council would have the ability to levy a tax each year unless and until the electorate removes that
authority from the City Council.

To foster accountability, the Measure requires the City's Finance Director to file an annual report with the
City Council stating the amount of taxes collected, the amount expended, and the purpose of the
expenditures.

Proceeds of the tax can only be used for (1) police operations, training and supplies, personnel,
equipment, law enforcement, dispatch, animal control, and facilities; (2) fire prevention and suppression
operations, training and supplies, firefighter and paramedic personnel, equipment and facilities; (3) code
enforcement; (4) street improvements; and (5) senior programs, parks, recreational services and
improvements.

The tax would be collected on the annual Kern County property tax bill. The tax would apply to all lots
and parcels within the boundaries of the City other than lots and parcels that (i) are exempt from this tax
pursuant to the Constitution or laws of the United States or of the Constitution or laws of the State of
California or (ii) are exempt from the ad valorem property tax or have an ad valorem property tax liability
of zero.

This measure was placed on the ballot by the City Council. It requires two-thirds voter approval for
passage.

Statement that Argument is True and Correct 10/4/17

Vote YES on Measure B.

Protect our local police, fire and 911 Emergency Services.

This tax is absolutely necessary to fund our police, fire and code enforcement departments. These are
essential public services currently available to us when we need them. But they are in serious jeopardy.
Contrary to what some suggest, our general fund doesn't have enough money to pay for public safety at
the current levels.

The current parcel tax will expire on June 30,2018 unless this measure passes. If it fails the City will lose
more than $6 million each year. After June 30, 2018 our community will see drastic reductions in police
and fire response to emergency calls. We'll see cutbacks in other city services such as street repair,
parks and senior programs.

The proposed tax is $150 per parcel per year, or merely $12.50 per month. This is a tremendous deal for
the citizens, especially considering the overwhelming majority of the tax is paid by people that do not
live in the city - why would anyone vote against receiving free money?

This is not a new tax. It simply continues the existing tax. Property owners would pay the same $150
already being paid. For this small amount, we gain greater control over our public safety services well
into the future. And good public safety helps to increase property values. A loss of public safety
services will destroy property values.

Many other rural communities are dependent on the county to provide public safety, but they receive
significantly delayed response times. So the city council, with support of residents, placed this measure
on the ballot to ensure our local public safety services will not be interrupted.

Vote YES to support our police and fire!

Vote Against Special Parcel Tax Measure "B"

Local government performance with taxpayers' money is out of
control; lacks strategic fiscal planning and is poorly managed.
Send the message to sustain police and fire in the general fund
and eliminate the regressive parcel tax dependency!

A no vote will send a message to strengthen the general tax base
to ensure revenue predictability for valued public safety
personnel.

Recent ordinance allowing medical cannabis businesses are
forecast to generate millions into the general fund each year.

Vote No on Measure "B"

Taxpayers are fed up with personnel issues; i.e. police chief
out on leave for almost 8 months. Government is spending
millions of your taxpayer money on pet projects, engineers,
attorneys, and consultants year after year. California City
history of excessive special taxes have not improved overall
fiscal sustainability, nor attracted investment in the
community.

The real question is simple: can we trust the City Officials
with more taxpayers' money?

Vote No on Measure "B"

According to the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, "Parcel
taxes are the biggest end-run around Proposition 13's one
percent limit on property taxes. Taxpayers should also be aware
how these taxes bear no relation to the value of their homes."

Adding special tax burdens is a destructive force on property
values. Kern County Auditor reports property values have tumbled
hundreds of millions dating back to Y2007-08 special tax levy.
Y2016-17 Assessed Valuation plummeted another $94 Million!

Fairness is essential

KernTax and MyCalCity.Org are opposed to special parcel taxes.

The general tax base is unsustainable because of failed economic
policies and special taxes; over 15,680 properties are tax
delinquent effective January, 2018. Another parcel tax levied

on the overburdened backs of taxpayers is equivalent to fiscal
insanity!

Voting No on Measure "B" will end the failed experiment!

THE TRUTH ABOUT SPECIAL PARCEL TAX MEASURE "B"

1.	Measure "B" has no expiration date.

2.	Why would taxpayers trust the local government with the power
to levy a special tax forever?

3.	Council discussed special taxes in perpetuity only after
public comment was closed. As a result, public participation
was avoided relating to forever taxes.

4.	Well-attended workshops on budget discussions directed council
to STOP SPECIAL TAX DEPENDENCY and focus all efforts on
encouraging expansion of the general tax base.

The proponents of Measure "B" ignore important facts:

5.	Kern County Taxpayers Association and MyCalCity.Org oppose
special taxes for general services such as police and fire,
because they are unfair taxes! City Officials have refused to
work with taxpayer organizations to ensure government
efficiencies, or to develop alternate revenue sources, which
would be more effective and healthier for the local economy.

6.	Police and fire should be paid for out of the general fund,
not special parcel taxes.

7.	Special parcel taxes are serious, unsustainable drain to the
tax base. 15,680 landowners defaulted on special taxes in
first half of fiscal year. Taxpayers are angry; taxes are not
"free" money!

8.	Measure "B" was presented to the city council with only one
day public notice. Non-resident taxpayers were not notified
and they cannot vote.

9.	No fiscal urgency exists because the current tax does not
expire until July 2018 and millions of dollars are available
in budget reserves and future cannabis business taxes.

Vote No on Measure "B"

Rebuttal to support Measure B

We are unique in our East Kern community in that we have our own fire and police. We benefit
daily from these local services and need to make sure they stay funded. Currently there is an
annual $150 parcel tax to fund our public safety services. This tax will end in June of this year
(2018). This will lead to a lack of funding, an estimated 6 million annually, which will have a
significant, negative impact on our emergency services. To prevent cutbacks the $150 revenue
from Measure B needs to continue.

Keeping our public safety strong is a basic quality of life issue. Having a safe community
translates to higher property values and lower insurance rates which in turn have a positive
impact on our local economy. This can be done by continuing to protect our public at a cost of
.41 cents a day or $12.50 a month. This is less than the average cable bill or dinner out.

This measure can be rescinded by the citizens of our city or our city council once enough
revenue is generated from other sources such as Measure A.

Let us keep our community safe, vote “Yes” on Measure B.
