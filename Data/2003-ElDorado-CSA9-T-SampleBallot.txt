The proposal is to raise the ceiling for parcel assessment from $250 to $500/year. This will allow
the Zone membership to annually vary the assessment not to exceed $500 per parcel. The main
reasons in favor are: (1) cost increases over time have not been accompanied by increasing the
fee, (2) maintenance delayed because of shortfalls has resulted in more expensive patching, and
(3) the Zone has added roads in 1998. The Zone was established in 1984 with a $200/parcel
assessment. This was raised in FY 1991/92 to the current $250/parcel level. However, this did
not keep pace with inflation in road maintenance prices. Since 1991, the chip seal maintenance
has roughly doubled (budgets rose from $0.10 to $0.27 in 2002). The Zone has therefore been
forced to delay seal coating and use a newer cheaper slurry seal product (budgeted at $0.18/SF
in 2002); which does not last as long as chip seal coating. Maintenance work each year has
been cut back to patching first, and then sealing the roads in the worst shape with the remaining
fees available. This has caused delayed seal coats, one reason leading to more patching in
following years which is more expensive than doing maintenance when required. For example, in
2002 $10,551 of patching work was required, reducing the seal coat line item planned from
$16,359 to $7,433. Also, the Zone road area has grown since the $250 fee was approved. In
1998 roughly 119,000 SF of new roads were added to the Zone, a 24% increase. If the
assessment ceiling is not raised, the delaying in maintenance will become worse and more road
will break up. Therefore, the ceiling for the annual fee should be raised to $500/year, which can
be varied below $500 based on yearly road maintenance needs.
