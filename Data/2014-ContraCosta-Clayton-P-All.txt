CITY OF CLAYTON

DOWNTOWN “THE GROVE” PARK FUNDING - EXTENSION OF
EXISTING SPECIAL TAX

To continue the operation and maintenance of the Downtown “The
Grove” Park, shall the existing special tax, funded by the citywide
Community Facilities District 2006-1 levy, be extended at the current
annual special tax with the same methodology rate (currently $19.03 per
year for single-family residential parcels, with higher commercial parcel
rate) for Fiscal Years 2017/2018 through 2036/2037?

CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF
MEASURE P

Measure “P” would extend the special tax levied for the maintenance and
operation of the City of Clayton’s Downtown “The Grove” Park, known
officially as Community Facilities District (“CFD”) 2006-1 through Fiscal
Year 2036/2037. This measure would not change the services provided
by the CFD, the rate of adjustment or the method of apportioning the
existing special tax.

The tax revenue pays for costs related to the operation and maintenance
of the Downtown “The Grove” Park, including repair and replacement of
landscaping, irrigation, hardscape, lights, public restroom, gazebo,
playground, water, electricity, etc. Other City parks are not maintained
by this special tax. These tax revenues are placed into a restricted use
fund through which all eligible expenses are tracked, paid and audited.
These funds are protected and cannot be spent for any other purpose by
the City and cannot be taken by the State, County or any other public or
private entity.

Following the advertised public hearing, on July 15, 2014 the City
Council adopted Resolution No. 32-2014 proposing to extend the special
tax in the CFD for twenty years and placing Measure “P” on the ballot.
The CFD is the sole funding source to pay for the operation and
maintenance of the Downtown Park (“The Grove”) and its related
facilities. The CFD’s boundaries encompass the entire City of Clayton.

In 2006, voters approved a special tax to fund the CFD through Fiscal
Year 2016/2017. The current annual special tax amounts are:

Residential Parcels: $19.08 per parcel.

Downtown Core Parcels: $257.56 per 1/4 acre or fraction thereof.

Other Commercial Parcels: $112.90 per 1/4 acre or fraction thereof.

Recreational Open Space Parcels: $56.44 per 1/4 acre or fraction
thereof.

Multi-Family Residential Care Facilities Parcels: $59.32 per 1/4 acre or
fraction thereof.

Measure “P” continues the existing tax rate methodology and existing
annual adjustment, including limiting any increases to the annual change
in the Consumer Price Index. In no event can an annual rate increase
approved by the City Council at a public meeting be higher than 3% over
the previous year. The proposed ballot measure would continue this
same formula for an additional 20 years (June 30, 2037).

Measure “P” requires approval from two-thirds of voters. Should Measure
“P” not be approved, the special tax will sunset and expire in June 2017.
However, should Measure “P” be approved, the special tax will sunset
and expire June 30, 2037.

Copies of all relevant reports, a boundary map of the CFD, and Council
resolutions concerning the formation of the CFD are available for review
in the office of the City Clerk (925-673-7300).

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure “P”. If you
desire a copy of the measure, please call the City Clerk's office at (925-
673-7300) and a copy will be mailed at no cost to you or obtain on the
City website: cityofclayton.org.

This analysis as prepared is an impartial analysis of the measure as
required by Calif. Govt. Code Section 53327 and Elections Code Section
9280.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF
MEASURE P

Clayton's "The Grove Park" is the heart of our historic downtown and a
favorite gathering place for our community. Families meet to walk, play,
picnic, and socialize in its beautifully landscaped setting. It’s the venue
for weddings, Concerts in The Grove, city events, and after-school play.
The tot lot and water play feature are happy places for kids of all ages.
Many go there just to relax and enjoy the amazing views of Mt. Diablo
and the beauty of our city.

The Grove Park opened in January 2008 after over 70% of Clayton
voters in 2006 approved the dedicated funds needed to pay for its
maintenance, operation and repairs. Its popularity and scenic
environment have exceeded expectations and the park has proven to be
an economic asset to our downtown.

The Grove Park restricted tax currently works to keep the park useable
year round. Measure P will extend the existing tax, set to expire in 2017,
for an added 20 years, thereby ensuring for future generations a
continued dedicated source of revenue to maintain our beautiful
downtown park. The current yearly rate is only $19.03 per residential
parcel, and any future rate increases cannot exceed 3% annually.

Measure P is endorsed by the Contra Costa Taxpayers Association and
was unanimously placed on this ballot by the Clayton City Council.

Residents, business owners and visitors constantly remark how much
everyone enjoys our wonderful Grove Park. Supporting the continuation
of this small per parcel tax will allow our City to continue providing a
beautiful, well-maintained park in downtown Clayton.

Please vote “Yes” on Measure P for our Grove Park!

MEETING DATE:	May	6,2014

SUBJECT:	Consider a proposed 15-year time extension to an existing special real

property parcel tax supporting and funding the Downtown Park’s [“The Grove
Park”] operation and maintenance by a local ballot measure on the November
___________2014 General Municipal Election._________________________________

RECOMMENDATION

Following staff report and public comment, by motion Council provide policy direction to staff
regarding the proposed 15-year time extension to the existing special parcel tax for the
downtown park (The Grove) and retaining the current tax rate methodology.

BACKGROUND

In 2006 the City received two per capita State park grants and, when combined with park in-
lieu fees and Redevelopment funds, was able to accumulate sufficient funds to construct the
Downtown Park (The Grove Park). Before commencing construction the City Council
determined General Fund monies were insufficient to undertake the ongoing maintenance and
operations of the park. The City Council established a Community Facilities District (CFD)
2006-1, which would be able to receive dedicated maintenance and operation funds if the
public voted for a special parcel tax. In November 2006 a ballot measure for such dedicated
funds was placed before the voters for the special tax known as Measure “O” for a 10 year
period through June 2017 (FY 16/17. It received 68.19% voter approval. The Grove Park was
then constructed and opened to public use in January 2008. The special tax was initially collected
via direct bill in November/December 2007 by the City due to timing of the election after the tax
levy deadlines, however thereafter it has been levied on the real property tax bills.

DISCUSSION

In November 2006 the electorate voted to establish a special tax, known as Measure O, for the
care and maintenance of Downtown Park, now known as “The Grove”. Measure O was
established for a 10 year period (through June 2017).

This special tax serves as the sole funding source for the Downtown Park Operation and
Maintenance - known officially as Community Facilities District (CFD) 2006-1. To levy the tax the
City placed a ballot measure on the November 2006 consolidated election and received more than
the minimum vote threshold (66.66%) to enact the tax.

Subject: Consider a proposed 15-year time extension to an existing special real property parcel tax supporting and
funding the Downtown Park’s [“The Grove Park”] operation and maintenance by a local ballot measure on
the November 2014 General Municipal Election.

Date: May 6, 2014

Page 2 of 2_________________________________________________________________________

The tax revenue pays for costs related to the operation, maintenance, repair and replacement
landscaping, irrigation, hardscape, lights, public restroom, gazebo, playground, water, electricity,
etc. Other City parks are not maintained by this special tax (but through the General Fund).

The actual collection of the tax is done by the County. Established in the current voter-approved
tax is the authorization after the initial year, to increase the assessment by the CPI with a
maximum of 3% annually. It is recommended the City Council direct staff to prepare ballot
information for the November 2014 election which would extend the time period of the tax by 15
years beyond its expiration in 2017 with the same tax rate methodology.

FISCAL IMPACT

For fiscal year 2013-14 fiscal year the total annual levy amount was $18.56 per residential parcel.
The non-residential parcels for 2013-14 fiscal year are: Downtown Core, $250.56 per % acre or
fraction thereof; Other Commercial $109.84 per % acre or fraction thereof; Recreation Open Space
$54.92 per % acre or fraction thereof; Multifamily Residential Care Facilities $57.72 per !4 acre or
fraction thereof.

Currently there are approximately 4,103 parcels subject to the special tax; of these 4,043 are
residential and approximately 60 are non-residential. The total amount of revenue received from
this tax for FY 2013-14 is $116,834. These tax revenues are placed into a Special Revenue
(restricted use) Fund (No. 211) through which all eligible expenses are tracked, paid and audited.
Allowable expenses include only that for the purposes of the Downtown Park Operation and
Maintenance District such as materials, supplies, equipment, utilities, labor, and administration.

If the special tax is not placed before the voters the last levy will occur in FY 16/17 and thereafter
there is no funding to continue its operations and maintenance. If the flat-lined General Fund must
absorb operation and maintenance of The Grove, cuts elsewhere in the General Fund Budget
totaling approximately $120,000 would be necessary. By acceptance of State grant funds to
construct the public park, the City agreed to maintain and operate the facility for a period of 20
years..

FISCAL IMPACT

No general fund monies will be expended in connection with this ballot measure; cost for the
ballot portion related to the Park Tax would be paid for out of the CFD Funds. The cost for an
election are less expensive when combined with a general consolidated election cycle rather
than during a primary or off year (ie: 2015) election cycle. If the election is held in the next
general election cycle (November 2016) and is unsuccessful there would be no opportunity to
place it on a future election without a gap in the funding stream.

CONCLUSION

It is recommended the City Council direct staff to prepare necessary documents and authorize
other matters relating thereto, for proceeding with the process for placement of a time
extension only of 15 years with the same tax rate methodology for Community Facilities
District (CFD 2006-1) special tax for the Downtown Park (Grove Park) on the November 2014
general election ballot.

BACKGROUND

In 2006 the City received two per capita State park grants and, when combined with park in-
lieu fees and redevelopment funds, was able to accumulate sufficient funds to construct a
new Downtown Park (The Grove Park). Before commencing construction the City Council
determined General Fund monies were insufficient to undertake the ongoing maintenance
and operations of the park. The City Council established a Community Facilities District
(CFD) 2006-1, which would be able to receive dedicated maintenance and operation funds if
the public voted for a special parcel tax to maintain the park. In November 2006 a ballot
measure for such dedicated funds was placed before the voters for the special tax known as
Measure "O" for a 10 year period through June 2017 (FY 16/17). It received 68.19% voter
approval. The Grove Park was then constructed and opened to public use in January 2008.
The special tax was initially collected via direct bill in November/December 2007 by the City
due to timing of the election after the tax levy deadlines, however thereafter it has been
levied on the real property tax bills.

Subject: Downtown Park CFD Special Tax Extension
Date: May 20, 2014

Page 2 of 3____________________________________

On May 4, 2014, the City Council directed staff to explore placing a fifteen year extension of
the special tax in the CFD2006-1 before the voters in the November 2014 general election.
This item is the first step in the formal process to extend the existing special tax in the CFD
until June 2032 with the same tax rate methodology.

DISCUSSION

In November 2006, the electorate voted to establish a special tax, known as Measure O, for
the care and maintenance of Downtown Park, now known as "The Grove". Measure O was
established for a 10 year period (through June 2017).

This special tax serves as the sole funding source for the Downtown Park Operation and
Maintenance — known officially as Community Facilities District (CFD) 2006-1. To levy the
tax, the City placed a ballot measure on the November 2006 general election and received
more than the minimum vote threshold (66.66%) to enact the tax. The tax revenue pays for
costs related to the operation, maintenance, repair and replacement landscaping, irrigation,
hardscape, lights, public restroom, gazebo, playground, water, electricity, etc. Other City
parks are not maintained by this special tax (but through the General Fund).

In order to extend the current special tax to a longer period, the process requires technically
the levying a new special tax in the CFD to extend the current tax; and consists of three
major steps: (1) adopting a Resolution of Consideration to start the process, (2) conducting
a public hearing on the Resolution and (3) submitting the tax extension to the voters. The
enclosed Resolution of Consideration is the first step. It would schedule a public hearing for
July 1st for affected parties to provide comments regarding the proposal. As long as less
than half of all affected property owners do not submit written protests regarding the
proposal at the hearing, the City Council can submit the measure to the voters at the
November general election. The measure requires two-thirds (66.66%) voter support to be
approved.

In addition to providing the City Council with the required Resolution of Consideration, staff
provides a sample ballot language for the Council’s consideration. The Council will not be
approving this language tonight but simply providing direction to staff. Staff will ensure the
Council’s direction is incorporated when formal ballot language is provided at a future
Council meeting.

The Ballot Language is limited to a maximum of 75 words including the Ballot Title.

Sample language options:

Option 1: (55 words)

be extended at the current annual special tax with the same methodology rate for
Fiscal Years 2017/2018 through 2031/2032?

FISCAL IMPACT

No General Fund monies will be expended in connection with this ballot measure; cost for
the ballot portion related to the Park Tax would be paid from the CFD 2006-1 Funds. The
cost for an election is less expensive when combined with a general consolidated election
cycle rather than during a primary or off year (i.e.: 2015) election cycle. If the election is held
in the next general election cycle (November 2016) and is unsuccessful there would be no
opportunity to place it on a future election without a gap in the funding stream.

CONCLUSION

It is recommended the City Council:

(1)	Adopt the attached Resolution of Consideration

(2)	Schedule a public hearing regarding the same for July 1,2014

(3)	Provide direction to staff regarding the sample ballot language.

RECOMMENDATION

Open the public hearing, receive any comments and continue the public hearing to the City
Council meeting of July 15, 2014.

Due to a change in the Contra Costa Times newspaper legal section email address that staff
was unaware of, there was a delay in the receipt of the required legal notice for this July 1
meeting. The legal notice was not published until June 25, one day later than required to hold
the hearing on July 1st. Therefore the associated Public Hearing needs to be continued to July
15, 2014. This change does not adversely affect the overall process as the filing deadline for
the ballot measure is August 8th. The hearing on July 15th would include consideration of the
Resolution to file the ballot language, and direct the City Attorney to prepare the required
impartial analysis.

However, at this hearing the City Council can determine if it wishes to authorize one or more
Council Members to prepare ballot the argument and/or rebuttal, if necessary. If the City
Council declines as a body it still allows for individual members to submit ballot arguments in
favor. The City Council did not submit ballot arguments for the original measure in 2006.

BACKGROUND

In November 2006 the electorate voted 68.19% approval to establish a special tax, known as
Measure O, for the care and maintenance of Downtown Park, known as “The Grove”. Measure
O was established for a 10 year period (through 2017). This special tax serves as the only funding
source for the Downtown Park Operation and Maintenance - known as Community Facilities
District (CFD) 2006-1.

At the May 6th meeting the City Council directed staff to move forward for the November 2014
election, consideration of an extension of the Grove Park parcel tax with the same tax rate

SUBJECT:	Continued	Public Hearing to consider a proposed 20-year time extension to the

existing Community Facilities District’s (CFD’s) annual real property special
parcel tax that funds the Downtown Park’s [“The Grove Park”] annual
operation and maintenance by placement of a local ballot measure on the
____________November	2014 General Municipal Election.________________________

RECOMMENDATION

Upon conclusion of the staff report, and any public comments received from the continued
public hearing, it is recommended the City Council adopt the attached resolution associated
with the placing of a ballot measure for a 20 year extension for the operation and maintenance
of the existing Downtown Park (“The Grove Park”) [Community Facilitates District (CFD)
2006-1], special tax be considered by the voters on the November 4, 2014 election.

BACKGROUND

In 2006 the City received two per capita State park grants and, when combined with park in-lieu
fees and redevelopment funds, was able to accumulate sufficient funds to construct a new
Downtown Park (“The Grove Park"). By acceptance of State grant funds to construct the public
park, the City agreed to maintain and operate the facility for a period of 20 years. Before
commencing construction the City Council determined Genera! Fund monies were insufficient to
undertake the added cost of a new park’s ongoing maintenance and operations. The City Council
established a Community Facilities District (CFD) 2006-1, which would be able to receive
dedicated maintenance and operation funds if the public voted for a special parcel tax to maintain
the park if constructed by the City. In November 2006 a ballot measure for such dedicated funds
was placed before the voters for the special tax known as Measure "O" for a 10 year period
through June 2017 (FY 16/17). It received 68.19% voter approval. “The Grove Park” was then
constructed and opened to public use in January 2008. This special tax serves as the sole funding
source for the Downtown Park Operation and Maintenance - known as Community Facilities
District (CFD) 2006-1.

At its May 6, 2014 public meeting the City Council directed staff to move forward on the
November 2014 election, the consideration of an extension of ‘The Grove Park” parcel tax
with the same tax rate and methodology.

At its May 20th meeting the City Council formally adopted a Resolution to schedule the
required ballot measure public hearing for July 1, 2014.

Subject: Consider a proposed 20-year time extension to an existing special real property parcel tax supporting and
funding the Downtown Park’s [“The Grove Park’1] operation and maintenance by a local ballot measure on
the November 2014 General Municipal Election.

Meeting Date: July 15,2014

DISCUSSION

The public hearing was opened on July 1, 2014 and continued to July 15, 2014 due to legal
publication notice delay. At the July 1st meeting the City Council did authorize an ad-hoc group of
the legislative body (Councilmembers Pierce and Geller) to prepare the ballot argument in support
of the measure. The July 15, 2014 public hearing is the last step in the process to place the ballot
measure before the voters on the upcoming election. The City Council will be taking final action on
the directing the placement of the ballot on the November 4, 2014 election, the final ballot wording,
and directing the City Attorney to prepare the required impartial analysis. As long as less than half
of all affected property owners do not submit written protests regarding the proposal at the hearing,
the City Council can submit the measure to the voters at the November general election. The
measure requires two-thirds (66.66%) voter support to be approved as a special purpose tax.

At is May 20th meeting the City Council identified a preference for the following ballot
language.

(ballot language is limited to a maximum of 75 words including the ballot title):

Measure______, City of Clayton

Downtown (The Grove) Park Funding - Extension of Existing Special Tax

"To continue the maintenance and operation of the Downtown Park ("The Grove Park”,
shall the existing special tax funded through city wide Community Facilities District
2006-1 levy be extended at the current annual special tax with the same methodology
rate, for Fiscal Years 2017/18 through 2036/37.”

(56 words)

City staff has consulted with the City Attorney and found that the ballot wording could include a
reference to the current rates. As such the staff has prepared alternative additional wording for the
City Council consideration:

Measure_______, City of Clayton

Downtown (The Grove) Park Funding - Extension of Existing Special Tax

“To continue the maintenance and operation of the Downtown Park (“The Grove Park”,
shall the existing special tax funded through city wide Community Facilities District
2006-1 levy be extended at the current annual special tax with the same methodology
rate (currently $19.03 per year for single-family residential parcels, with a higher
commercial parcel rate), for Fiscal Years 2017/18 through 2036/37.”

(70 words)

Subject: Consider a proposed 20-year time extension to an existing special real property parcel tax supporting and
funding the Downtown Park’s [‘The Grove Park”] operation and maintenance by a local ballot measure on
the November 2014 General Municipal Election.

Meeting Date: July 15, 2014

Page 3 of 5______________________________________________________________________________

The ballot measure continues the same tax rate methodology and same annual adjustment in
the Consumer Price Index but in no event can the annual rate increase be higher than 3%
over the previous year.

This special tax serves as the sole funding source for the Downtown Park Operation and
Maintenance - known officially as Community Facilities District (CFD) 2006-1. There are not
sufficient funds elsewhere in the General Fund budget to undertake the ongoing $120,000
operational and maintenance costs of this park. The tax revenue pays for costs related to the
operation, maintenance, repair and replacement landscaping, irrigation, hardscape, lights, public
restroom, gazebo, playground, water, electricity, etc. Other City parks are not maintained by this
special tax (but through the General Fund).

The rate for FY 14/15 is $19.08 per residential parcel. The non-residential parcels: Downtown
Core, $257.56 per V* acre or fraction thereof; Other Commercial $112.90 per % acre or fraction
thereof; Recreation Open Space $56.44 per % acre or fraction thereof; Multifamily Residential
Care Facilities $59.32 per !4 acre or fraction thereof. The amounts can be increased by the CPI
annually with a maximum cap of 3% annual increase.

Currently there are approximately 4,103 parcels subject to the special tax; of these 4,043 are
residential and approximately 60 are non-residential. The total amount of revenue to be received
from this tax for FY 2014-15 is $120,101. These tax revenues are placed into a Special Revenue
(restricted use) Fund (No. 211) through which all eligible expenses are tracked, paid and audited.
Allowable expenses include only that for the purposes of the Downtown Park Operation and
Maintenance District such as materials, supplies, equipment, utilities, labor, and administration.

It currently costs about $110,000 per year to properly care for and maintain the Downtown
“The Grove” Park. This park has become a focal point to the downtown and has
accomplished the goals that were originally planned: the presence of an active recreation
public park in the Town Center, lively gathering areas for all ages, and a means to draw
people to the downtown to help encourage economic patronage of local businesses. As was
also anticipated with the park, the high patronage and prominent visibility results in on-going
wear-and-tear to the Park's facilities play apparatus, infrastructure and landscaping.
Consequently, the annual budget required for the Park has and continues to include additional
annual monies to establish and maintain a Park Asset Replacement and Reserve Fund of
$10,000 to address these realities. The total annual special tax revenue for FY 14/15 is
$120,106.

All revenues generated by the CFD's annual special tax have been and would continue to be
used soleiy for the operation and maintenance of the Downtown “Grove” Park. The CFD's
funds cannot be spent for any other purpose by the City and cannot be “stolen” by state
budget schemes. All tax revenues remain local with the exception of an annual fee that must
be paid by the CFD for the County's collection of this special tax with the property tax bills.
With voter approval, the CFD's special tax would commence in tax year 20017-2018 and
would expire at the end of tax year 2036-2037 (June 30, 2037).

Subject: Consider a proposed 20-year time extension to an existing special real property parcel tax supporting and
funding the Downtown Park’s [“The Grove Park”] operation and maintenance by a local ballot measure on
the November 2014 General Municipal Election.

Meeting Date: July 15, 2014

BALLOT MEASURE AND ELECTION PROCEDURES

The City Council, by virtue of calling the election and author of the ballot measure, retains the
authority to write the actual ballot measure text. The Resolution calling the Election
incorporates the text of the ballot measure itself that will appear on the voter's actual ballot
and in the Voter Information Pamphlet.

The measure’s text is limited to 75 words, as counted pursuant to the CA Elections Code. The
recommended text has been simplified for clarity and purpose. The City Council may modify
the proposed ballot measure prior to adoption of this Resolution, provided the modifications
result in a text not exceeding 75 words.

The City Attorney is also directed by the enactment of this Resolution to prepare an impartial
analysis of the proposed ballot measure. The impartial analysis will be printed in the local
Voter Information Pamphlet provided to each registered voter in Clayton, and must be filed
with the City Clerk by the August 15th deadline.

Further, the Resolution calling the Election establishes a deadline date of August 20, 2014 for
submittal of any Arguments For or Against the proposed measure. (Corresponding Rebuttal
Arguments must be filed with the City Clerk by August 25, 2014).

As author and proponent of the ballot measure, the City Council did at its July 1, 2014
meeting (by motion) authorize two of its members (Councilmember Pierce and
Councilmember Geller) to author the Argument In Favor of the ballot measure. In doing such
this argument is for printing in the Voter Pamphlet (ie: Election Guide), and is placed above
any interested citizens or individual members of Council acting on their own.

FISCAL IMPACT

No General Fund monies will be expended in connection with this ballot measure; cost for the
ballot portion related to the Park Tax would be paid from the CFD 2006-1 Funds. The cost for
an election is less expensive when combined with a general consolidated election cycle rather
than during a primary or off year (i.e.; 2015) election cycle. If the election is held in the next
general election cycle (November 2016) and is unsuccessful there would be no opportunity to
place it on a future election without a gap in the funding stream.

With the consolidation benefit, the election cost for the ballot measure is only the
incremental expense for printing and distribution of a Voter Information Pamphlet about the
ballot measure to each registered voter in Clayton. The County Elections Office has informed
our City Clerk they expect this cost to be approximately $19,200 (for 2-6 pages of ballot
information). The cost of this ballot measure election must be paid by the Downtown “The
Grove” Park Fund and such expenditure was incorporated into the Downtown “The Grove”
Park fund budget in FY 14/15, recently adopted by the City Council. The attached Resolution
also includes in Section 9, appropriate language to ensure the funding for the election costs of
the ballot measure are paid from “The Grove Park” special funds.
