share of the City’s local tax revenue in order to balance the State budget, thereby exacerbating
the City’s budget problems; and

eliminate waste and reduce employee salaries and benefits in order to adjust to the realities of the
current economic situation; and

additional revenue or drastically reduce essential City services; and
