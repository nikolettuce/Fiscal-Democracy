----------- -	ANALYSIS	OF PROPOSITION X

By DeWitt W. Clinton, County Counsel

Approval of this ballot measure would allow the Wisebum School District to
impose a special tax of up to $100 per year upon each parcel of real property
within the District The tax would be for a maximum four-year period. The
precise amount of the tax would be determined each year by the Board of
Trustees following a public hearing.

This measure exempts taxpayers 65 years of age or older.

The taxes may be used to provide special reading teachers, computer instruction,
special instruction for gifted and talented students, instrumental music
instruction for grades 4 through 8, and support and transportation services.

The approval of the measure would also allow the District to increase the legal
ceiling on expenditures currently imposed by the State Constitution. This
increase in the ceiling is limited to four (4) years, without additional voter
approval.

A two-thirds vote is required for passage of the measure.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION X

Help S O S.

Most of us selected and invested in our homes, in part, because of the reputation |
of the Wiseburn Schools and the superior education offered students.	|

Funding changes have created an emergency. Our schools are about to lose the :
winning edge that has enabled Wiseburn to stand out. The proposed Parcel Tax
will allow the continuation of the supportive and selective educational programs ;
which help keep Wiseburn one of the most sought after places to live in the
South Bay.	I

The choice is ours, the Wiseburn School Trustees have sent out an S.O.S. |
(Support Our Schools) call. We feel it is time to reinvest in our community, f
For less than 28 cents per day we can support our schools, support our tradition, |
support our kids, protect our investment and keep Wiseburn Schools at the top. *
A real bargain!

We eare, we have pride in our community. We know you do too. Please join ;

' us, make that WISE choice. Acknowledge the S.O.S. call. VOTE YES.
