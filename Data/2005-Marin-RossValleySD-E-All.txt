SAN ANSELMO AND FAIRFAX
MARIN COUNTY, CALIFORNIA

In the Matter of a )	RESOLUTION	AND	ORDER

Parcel Tax Election )	OF	ELECTION

THE ROSS VALLEY SCHOOL DISTRICT GOVERNING BOARD FINDS:

State funding for education has been inadequate and unpredictable, and
without the funds provided by the current parcel tax assessment, the
Ross Valley School District (Brookside, Manor, and Wade Thomas
elementary schools and White Hill Middle School) would be forced to
reduce or eliminate important programs beneficial and necessary to the
children who attend the schools of the District; and

The voters of San Anselmo and Fairfax have consistently supported the
District's excellent education program through the passage of local
parcel taxes and bonds that have enabled the recruitment and retention
of superior teachers and staff, small class sizes, and renovation of all
local school facilities; and

The voters of the District previously authorized a special assessment
which expires on June 30,2006, and without a renewed authorization by
the voters, a substantial reduction and elimination of educational
programs and services will result; and

Such voter support for the Ross Valley schools by the community has
tangible results in the form of consistently high student test scores and
safely rebuilt community buildings; and

A high quality public education system preserves and protects the values
of properties as well as the long term quality of life in our community;
and

The Ross Valley School District cannot continue to maintain its excellent
educational program without the continuation of the existing parcel tax,
and without the parcel tax would be forced to significantly increase class
sizes, lay-off teachers and staff, and cut vital programs; and

The Ross Valley School District has worked collaboratively with its
schools community foundation, YES, and its local school parent
organizations to fill in as much of the funding gap as possible through
annual direct contributions; and

These community partners will continue to raise essential funds to
provide art, music, poetry, and drama for students across the District as
well as other site needs; and

The State of California's budget problems make increased state funding
unlikely, and the federal government has withheld earmarked federal
funds for such services as special education; and

The Ross Valley School District is committed to the highest standards of
fiscal accountability and budget transparency, for which it has been
publicly praised by the County; and must, by law, create a balanced
three-year budget with a 3% reserve; and

Section 4 of Article XIIIA of the California Constitution and Government
Code Sections 50075, 50076, 50077, 50079,53720, et. seq., authorize
school districts to levy a special tax for specified purposes upon approval
by two thirds of the votes cast.

NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Governing Board of the
Ross Valley School District as follows:

Section 1: A special election is called and ordered and shall be
conducted on March 8, 2005, at which election will be submitted to the

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE E	
We urge the voters of Fairfax and San Anselmo to maintain the high standards of our public schools - standards which make Ross Valley one of the most desirable places to live in California.	
Vote YES for Measure E because it:	
o Represents NO NEW TAXES - this is simply a renewal of the existing funding measure which has not changed  •	Keeps class sizes small - and prevents us from returning to 30 plus students per class  •	Prevents us from having to lay off up to 20 of our most recently hired teachers - which would reduce our teaching staff by 20%  •	Strengthens current and future property values for all residents because high-quality public schools remain a top priority for home buyers  •	Ensures that your money will be spent wisely through stringent accountability and mandated annual audits.	■
Renewing the parcel tax for the Ross Valley School District makes common sense for our community. The parcel tax, initially passed in 1993, demonstrates the value Fairfax and San Anselmo voters place on public education. Through this measure, we merely seek to renew for eight years what has been strongly supported on two prior occasions.	
The parcel tax provides critical funds (12.4% of the RVSD budget or $1.8 million) to our local K-8 schools which serve almost 1800 students. The parcel tax has played an indispensable role in building our outstanding reputation for excellence and the high achievement levels of our students.	NO ARGUMENT AGAINST THIS
Through a locally controlled funding source, Measure E will keep our K-8 schools strong - despite continued inadequate state funding.  Good schools are an asset to the whole community. Vote YES on Measure E on March S01 to keep our public schools strong. You'll be proud of your support.	MEASURE WAS SUBMITTED
