PROPOSED ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF FARMERSVILLE ENACTING A ONE-HALF PERCENT	s/ Moses Diaz
(0.5%, OR ONE-HALF PENNY PER DOLLAR) GENERAL SALES TAX.	Michael L. Farley, City Attorney Moses Diaz, Deputy City Attorney
Upon voter approval, section 7285.9 of the Revenue and Taxation Code authorizes a city to levy a general purpose retail transactions and use tax (“sales tax”) on tangible personal property. In order for the sales tax to be approved, a majority vote of the qualified voters of the city voting on this measure must vote in favor of the measure.  If this measure is approved, Ordinance No. 483 of the City of Farmersville (“City”) will be implemented, imposing a transactions and use tax upon all retailers within the incorporated territory of the City at the rate of one-half (1/2) percent (or one-half of a penny per dollar). The authority to levy the tax will be effective until repealed by a duly enacted ordinance. However, the City Council would have authority to temporarily suspend collection of the tax by resolution unanimously approved by all members of the entire City Council.  The revenues derived from the sales tax must be placed in the City’s General Fund and may be used for any general city purpose, including but not limited to maintaining and/or improving: 9-1-1 emergency response and neighborhood police patrols; fire protection services; streets and roads repairs; support of senior and youth services; city parks; recreation programs; and any other city services for Farmersville residents and the public.  If this measure is approved, the ordinance will become operative but the retail transactions and use tax cannot be levied earlier than first day of the first calendar quarter commencing more than one hundred ten (110) days after the adoption of the ordinance by the voters.  All amendments subsequent to voter approval to Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code relating to sales and use taxes and which are not inconsistent with Part 1.6 and Part 1.7 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, and all amendments to Part 1.6 and Part 1.7 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, shall automatically become a part of the ordinance implementing this measure. The proposed ordinance contains certain exemptions and exclusions from the computation of the amount of the transactions and use tax on certain transactions, including those exemptions already applicable under state law.  This measure was added to the ballot by the City Council and makes no change to existing laws but will add to existing laws a citywide ordinance imposing a one-half (1/2) percent transactions and use tax within the City of Farmersville. The electors entitled to vote on this measure are the registered voters within City of Farmersville. If the measure is not approved by a majority vote of the votes cast on the measure, the measure will fail and the tax will not be imposed.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE P

CIUDAD DE FARMERSVILLE____

ARGUMENTO A FAVOR DE LA MEDIDA P

ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF FARMERSVILLE
ENACTING A ONE-HALF PERCENT (0.5%, OR
ONE-HALF PENNY PER DOLLAR) GENERAL
SALES TAX.

This is a general tax to pay for basic city services. It
will pay for police, fire, street and sidewalk repair,
senior and youth recreation and other essential city
services.

The Great Recession left us with reduced property tax
revenues. This has made it a difficult challenge to
provide the most basic of services. We have had to
leave city staff positions unfilled, use old, unreliable
equipment to maintain critical municipal services and
cut funding for other essential city services. We have
delayed maintenance on our streets, city buildings
and storm drains. Farmersville maintains only the
most basic city services. Now those are at risk too.

We have had to leave police officer positions unfilled.
We may have to make drastic cuts in all departments
(police, fire, and public works).

Many City improvements have been made using
grants without a cost to the city, but core services
depend on general fund revenue that this tax measure
would help support. The State and County keep most
of the sales tax collected in Farmersville with only
roughly one and a half pennies of every dollar paid to
Farmersville. The passage of this measure will
provide an estimated $280,000 in new funds. While
this additional revenue will not entirely solve our
financial situation, it will certainly help! Importantly,
this local tax cannot be taken away by the State.
These funds will be accounted for in our audit and the
audit report will be available to the public.

Please approve this measure and help Farmersville
move toward a better future for everyone who resides
here.

Please join us in voting Yes on Measure P.

ORDENANZA DE LA CIUDAD DE FARMERSVILLE EN
LA QUE SE PROMULGA UN IMPUESTO GENERAL DE
MEDIO PUNTO PORCENTUAL (0.5 %, O MEDIO
CENTAVO POR DOLAR) SOBRE LAS VENTAS.

Este es un impuesto general para pagar los servicios
basicos de la ciudad. Pagara los servicios de policfa y
bomberos, reparaciones de banquetas, entretenimiento
para jovenes y personas de la tercera edad, y otros
servicios indispensables en la ciudad.

La Gran Recesion redujo las recaudaciones del impuesto
a la propiedad. Como consecuencia, proporcionar los
servicios mas basicos se ha vuelto un reto dificil. Tuvimos
que dejar vacantes puestos del personal de la ciudad,
usar equipo obsoleto y poco fiable para mantener
servicios municipales fundamentales y recortar los fondos
para dedicarlos a otros servicios indispensables de la
ciudad. Retrasamos el mantenimiento de nuestras calles,
de los edificios de la ciudad y del alcantarillado pluvial.
Farmersville solamente conserva los servicios mas
basicos de la ciudad. Y ahora, tambien esos estan en
riesgo. Hemos tenido que dejar vacantes puestos de
agentes de policla. Es probable que tengamos que hacer
recortes drasticos en todos los departamentos (policia,
bomberos y obras publicas).

Se han hecho muchas mejoras usando subsidios que no
cuestan nada a la ciudad, pero los servicios
fundamentales dependen de los ingresos del fondo
general, a los que apoyaria esta medida de impuestos. El
estado y el condado conservan la mayorfa de los
impuestos sobre las ventas que se recaudan en
Farmersville; solamente alrededor de un centavo y medio
por cada dolar se paga a Farmersville. La aprobacion de
esta medida proporcionara aproximadamente $280,000
de nuevos fondos. Si bien este ingreso adicional no
resolver^ por completo nuestra situacibn financiera, jsin
duda ayudara! Es importante mencionar que el estado no
puede tomar el dinero proveniente de este impuesto local.
Estos fondos se contabilizaran en nuestra auditoria y el
informe de auditoria estara disponible al publico.

Apruebe esta medida y ayude a Farmersville a avanzar
hacia un mejor future para todos sus residentes.

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY FARMERSVILLE CITY COUNSEL
MEASURE Q

PROPOSED ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF
FARMERSVILLE ENACTING A COMMERCIAL
CANNABIS BUSINESS TAX.

In November 2016, California voters approved
Proposition 64 which, among other things, decriminalized
the use, sale and cultivation of non-medicinal cannabis
by adults and set a maximum cultivation allowance for
non-medicinal cannabis. Proposition 64 also authorized
local control over land uses involving non-medicinal
cannabis. The City anticipates enactment of zoning
standards and regulations, which would govern those
types of land uses, prior to January 1, 2018.

Upon voter approval of Measure Q, Ordinance No. 484
would authorize the City of Farmersville (“City”) to levy an
excise tax on the privilege of conducting a commercial
cannabis business within the City. In order for the tax to
be approved, a majority vote of the qualified voters of the
City voting on this measure must vote in favor of the
measure.

Measure Q would impose a business tax on every person
engaged in a commercial cannabis business within the
City, without regard to whether it is medicinal or non-
medicinal cannabis. The maximum tax rate would be up
to the greater of either: (i) $25.00 per square foot of
business areas, annually adjusted upward based upon
the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”) for all urban
consumers in the San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose
areas; or (ii) 10% of gross receipts per fiscal year. The
City Council would be authorized to adopt a resolution
implementing a tax rate which is lower than the maximum
tax rate and may, by unanimous resolution of the entire
Council, temporarily suspend collection of the tax.

Measure Q is a general tax under state law and, if
enacted by the voters, the revenues received from the
tax must be placed in the City’s general fund and may be
used in any lawful purpose, as directed by the City
Council, including but not limited to addressing cannabis
industry impacts and/or maintaining and/or improving: 9-
1-1 emergency response and neighborhood police
patrols; fire protection services; streets and roads repairs;
support of senior and youth services; city parks;
recreation programs; and any other city services for
Farmersville residents and the public.

If this measure is approved by the voters, Ordinance No.
484 shall be adopted by the City Council on the date the
City Council declares the election results. The ordinance
will become effective (10) ten days thereafter but the tax
shall not be levied until the City Council has adopted a
resolution setting an effective tax rate and implementing
the tax.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE Q

CIUDAD DE FARMERSVILLE
ARGUMENTO A FAVOR DE LA MEDIDA Q

Vote Yes on Measure Q, the City of Farmersville
Cannabis Business Tax.

You, the taxpayer, have borne the cost of addressing
the negative impacts of illegal cannabis operations for
far too long. Taxpayers have had to fully fund the
rising costs of police, fire, emergency medical, code
enforcement and other public services, without
contributions from cannabis businesses. It’s time for
the cannabis industry to pay its fair share of taxes to
mitigate these and other adverse secondary impacts.

Measure Q is simple: If an authorized commercial
cannabis business operates within the City limits, that
business would contribute its fair share to the funding
of vital public services such as police, fire, roads and
parks and recreation.

Measure Q would provide funds to implement strict
standards, regulations and location requirements for
cannabis businesses. Too many unregulated
cannabis operations have burdened vital public
resources and increased crime. Revenue from this tax
will protect our vital public services and finally help put
an end to these illegal operations.

The children of our City are our most important asset.
Implementing this tax will fund recreation activities for
them and contribute to clean, healthy and safe
neighborhoods throughout our community

Since there is no guarantee that State tax revenue
from cannabis sales will fund any local services, it is
necessary to secure our own funding through this tax
measure. All revenue collected from Measure Q will
stay local to maintain important and essential City
services.

Help eliminate illegal cannabis operations and ensure
the cannabis industry operates legally and contributes
positively to the quality of life in the City of
Farmersville.

Please join us in voting Yes on Measure Q.

Vote a favor de la medida Q, Ciudad de Farmersville el
impuesto comercial al cannabis.

Usted, el contribuyente, ha soportado durante mucho
tiempo el costo de hacer frente a los efectos negativos del
negocio ilegal del cannabis. Los contribuyentes han tenido
que financiar por completo el aumento de los costos de
los servicios de policia, bomberos, medicina de
emergencia, cumplimiento de los reglamentos y otros
servicios publicos, sin contar con las contribuciones del
comercio del cannabis. Es tiempo de que la industria del
cannabis pague su parte justa de impuestos para mitigar
estos y otros efectos secundarios adversos.

La medida Q es simple: si se realiza de forma autorizada
el comercio del cannabis dentro de los llmites de la
ciudad, ese comercio aportarla su parte correspondiente
para financiar servicios publicos vitales, como la policia,
bomberos, caminos y parques, y recreacion.

La medida Q proporcionaria fondos para implementar
estandares, regulaciones y requisitos de ubicacidn
estrictos para el comercio del cannabis. Muchas
operaciones de cannabis no reguladas suponen una
carga para los recursos publicos mas importantes, y el
crimen ha aumentado. Los ingresos de este impuesto
protegeran nuestros servicios publicos mas importantes, y
finalmente ayudaran a poner fin a estas operaciones
ilegales.

Los nifios de nuestra ciudad son nuestro bien mas
preciado. Al implementar este impuesto se financial
actividades recreativas para ellos y se contribuira a crear
vecindarios limpios, sanos y seguros en toda nuestra
comunidad.

Debido a que no hay garantia de que los ingresos de
impuestos estatales de la venta de cannabis financiaran
los servicios locales, es necesario asegurar nuestro
propio financiamiento a traves de esta medida de
impuestos. Todos los ingresos recaudados con la medida
Q permaneceran a nivel local para mantener los servicios
importantes e indispensables de la ciudad.

Ayude a eliminar las operaciones ilegales de cannabis y a
asegurar que la industria de cannabis funcione legalmente
y contribuya de forma positiva a la calidad de vida de la
ciudad de Farmersville.

BEFORE THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE

CITY OF FARMERSVILLE

IN THE MATTER OF:

Resolution Calling City Election for Voter
Approval of General Transactions and Use
of One-Half Percent; and Specifications of
the Election Order.

RESOLUTION 2017-025

WHEREAS, approval of a local transactions and use tax ensures that the City of
Farmersville (“City”) has more local funding for vital City services which cannot be
taken by the State, ensuring our tax dollars are spent locally for the benefit of residents of
Farmersville;

WHEREAS, when a City seeks voter approval of a new local transactions and use
tax, Article XIIIC § 2(b) of the California Constitution requires the election to be
consolidated with the general municipal election for City council members, except in
cases in which a City Council has unanimously declared that there is a fiscal emergency;

WFIEREAS, in recent years the City has experienced insufficient growth in sales
tax revenues and other State revenues while the scope and cost of providing essential City
services has increased;

WHEREAS, projected deficits in the General Fund and other operating funds
threatens a reduction in staffing and services in all departments including public safety
personnel and other essential City services potentially placing Farmersville residents at
risk in emergency situations;

WHEREAS, the City’s expenditure trends, and reduction of federal funding of
public safety positions, point to a potential deficit in the General Fund and/or other
operating funds in the upcoming fiscal years which will limit the City’s ability to meet
public safety standards, fund recreational programs and facilities, maintain and improve
parks, repair and improve streets, and provide other general and essential services;

WHEREAS, the City Council received information during the budget review
process for the last couple of years which demonstrated that the City will be operating at
a significant General Fund and/or other operating fund deficits commencing in fiscal year
2017 and said deficit is estimated to continue in current and subsequent fiscal years even
with significant cuts to expenditures;

Page 1 of 7

WHEREAS, in light of the projected significant General Fund and/or other
operating fund deficits over the next several fiscal years the City Council desires to, and
by adoption of this resolution hereby does, unanimously declare a fiscal emergency under
Article XIIIC § 2(b) of the California Constitution;

WHEREAS, the City Council published a notice of a public hearing to be held on
July 14, 2017 to consider revenue measures be placed on the ballot of the November 7,
2017 General Election to seek voter approval of a proposed general transactions and use
tax (“general sales tax”) as authorized by Revenue and Taxation Code § 7285.9;

WHEREAS, the statutory deadline to authorize submittal of said general sales tax
measure to the County of Tulare’s elections office is scheduled to expire on or about
August 11, 2017 for the November 7, 2017 regular election date and the County’s
administrative deadline for submittal of relevant documentation is August 11, 2017;

WHEREAS, the new general sales tax would be imposed on retail transactions
involving sale and/or use of personal property. The tax rate would be one-half percent
(0.5%, or one-half penny per dollar) of the sales price of the property. The general sales
tax revenue would be collected by the California Board of Equalization as with other
sales taxes. Collection of all or any portion of the tax could be temporarily suspended by
a unanimous vote of the City Council. The tax would require approval of at least a
majority of voters voting on the measure and approval of this resolution by at least two-
thirds vote of all members of the City Council;

WHEREAS, based upon all of the information presented to the City Council as of
the date of this resolution, both written and oral, including the staff reports, minutes and
other relevant materials, the general sales tax does not constitute a project under CEQA
Guidelines 15060(c)(2), 15061(b)(3) and 15378(b)(2) and (4) and therefore review under
CEQA is not required; and

WHEREAS, on July 14, 2017, the City Council opened and held a public hearing
to consider placing a general sales tax ordinance before the voters of the City of
Farmersville at an election to be held on November 7, 2017, and said hearing was
continued to July 17 and July 24, 2017.

This chapter is adopted to achieve the following, among other
purposes, and directs that the provisions hereof be interpreted in order to
accomplish those purposes:

A.To impose a retail transactions and use tax in accordance with the
provisions of Part 1.6 (commencing with section 7251) of Division
2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code and section 7285.9 of Part 1.7
of Division 2 which authorizes the city to adopt this tax ordinance
which shall be operative if a majority of the electors voting on the

measure vote to approve the imposition of the tax at an election
called for that purpose.

B.	To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that
incorporates provisions identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax
Law of the State of California insofar as those provisions are not
inconsistent with the requirements and limitations contained in Part
1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.

C.	To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that imposes a
tax and provides a measure therefore that can be administered and
collected by the State Board of Equalization in a manner that
adapts itself as fully as practicable to, and requires the least
possible deviation from, the existing statutory and administrative
procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in
administering and collecting California state sales and use taxes.

D.	To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that can be
administered in a manner that will be, to the greatest degree
possible, consistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of Division 2 of
the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting
the transactions and use taxes, and at the same time, minimize the
burden of record keeping upon persons subject to taxation under
the provisions of this chapter.

3.36.040: CONTRACT FOR ADMINISTRATION.

Prior to the operative date, the city shall contract with the California

territory on and after the operative date of this chapter.

3.36.060: PLACE OF SALE.

destination. The gross receipts from such sales shall include delivery
charges, when such charges are subject to the state sales and use tax,
regardless of the place to which delivery is made. In the event a retailer has
no permanent place of business in the state or has more than one place of
business, the place or places at which the retail sales are consummated shall
be determined under rules and regulations as may be prescribed and
adopted from time to time by the State Board of Equalization.
