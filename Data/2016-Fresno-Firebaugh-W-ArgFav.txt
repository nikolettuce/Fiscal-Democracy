The Firebaugh City Council urges citizens to vote YES for Measure	, which places a 5%

utility users tax (UUT) on new telecommunication technologies such as wireless and voice
over Internet services. The City has had such a UUT on phone services (landlines) for 25
years. The current rate applicable to this landline, telephone service is 10%. Measure ^
simply applies the current tax (at a lower rate, 5%) to new technologies that did not exist when
the UUT was first approved. All revenues would go to the City's General Fund, which
predominantly supports Police and Fire services. The City's General Fund revenues have
been hit especially hard these past several years and continued cutbacks could jeopardize
safety services. Since Public Safety Services (police and fire) consume, by far, the largest part
of General Fund revenues, reductions in these revenues will have negative impact on these
and other vital City services.
