<impartial> IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS FROM COUNTY COUNSEL
The Contra Costa County Board of Supervisors proposes a transactions and use tax (sales tax). The transactions portion of the tax will generally be imposed for the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail. The use portion of the tax will generally be imposed upon the storage, use, or other consumption in the County of tangible personal property purchased from any retailer for storage, use, or consumption in the County. The revenues collected from the tax will be used for Contra Costa County Public Libraries and the City of Richmond Public Library. The tax revenues will supplement, and not replace, existing funding for the support of public libraries.

The ballot measure provides for a Countywide transactions and use tax (sales tax) of one-eighth of one percent (0.125%) for eight (8) years, ending on March 31, 2009. The proceeds of the transactions and use tax will be used for the following public library purposes: to restore library services, programs, operations and facilities that were eliminated due to budget cutbacks; to maintain existing library services, programs, collections, operations and facilities; and to improve, upgrade and expand library services, programs, operations and facilities to all areas of the County, including, but not limited to, areas presently unserved or underserved. Projects for which the proceeds of the tax may be spent include, but are not limited to, the following:

1. Restoring, maintaining, and improving local public library services throughout the County.
2. Restoring, maintaining, and increasing open hours at libraries.
3. Restoring, maintaining and increasing the book and materials budgets at the libraries.
4. Restoring, maintaining, developing and increasing service programs (such as literacy, outreach, and volunteer programs) for user populations (such as children, seniors, physically challenged users, and businesses).
5. Acquiring and replacing library furniture, fixtures, and equipment.
6. Acquiring, renovating and constructing library facilities.
7. Restoring, maintaining and improving computer systems and library technology needs at the libraries.
Two-thirds of those voting on the measure must approve the measure for it to pass. <impartialend>









<favor> Arguments For Measure L
At a time when learning and literacy are more important than ever, our neighborhood libraries are in trouble. Our population has skyrocketed. Service demands have soared. In fact, the situation has become so bad that our libraries are ranked 36th of 37 Bay Area library systems.
	•	Books and materials are outdated and worn.
	•	After-school and homework assistance programs have been reduced.
	•	Services that meet the needs of seniors are insufficient.
	•	Literacy programs for children and adults are inadequate
	•	Libraries are open too few hours on nights and weekends. 
LITERACY, LEARNING, AND LOCAL LIBRARIES - INVEST 1/8th of a PENNY.
MEASURE L: EXCLUSIVELY FOR LIBRARIES: This measure increases the sales tax by just 1/8 of a penny, exclusively for library services. State and local laws guarantee the money can only be used for libraries. A Task Force of citizens and elected officials in each library region will ensure that funds will be used for services needed at your local library. Measure L automatically expires after eight years.
Vote YES for BOOKS AND MATERIALS: Doubling the books and materials budget will allow worn and outdated materials to be replaced.
Vote YES for AFTER-SCHOOL AND HOMEWORK PROGRAMS: Libraries are critical to improving education. Homework assistance, after-school programs, and joint-use programs with our schools will increase if this measure passes.
Vote YES for NIGHT and WEEKEND HOURS: Libraries will be open longer, more convenient hours, especially nights and weekends.
Vote YES for SENIOR SERVICES: Large-print books, books on tape, and mobile services will be improved with Measure L.
Vote YES for OUR FUTURE: More computer work-stations and Internet services for students and adults will be available with Measure L.

<rebutfavor> Rebuttal to Arguments For
LITERACY, LEARNING, AND OUTSTANDING LIBRARIES CAN AND SHOULD BE PROVIDED WITH EXISTING FUNDS, NOT NEW TAXES.
	•	DESPITE STATE GOVERNMENT'S ENORMOUS $13 BILLION TAX SURPLUS, Measure L demands MORE from Contra Costa's overtaxed families.
	•	MEASURE L EFFECTIVELY ENDORSES CALIFORNIA'S $3.9 BILLION ANNUAL REVENUE SEIZURE FROM LOCAL JURISDICTIONS - misrepresented by politicians as money for schools (Dan Walter, Sacramento Bee, 7/20/00).
	•	DESPITE STATE REVENUE GRABS, CONTRA COSTA COUNTY IS "PROBABLY IN BETTER FISCAL CONDITION THAN AT ANY TIME IN THIS DECADE" (county administrator Phil Batchelor, quoted in "Plenty of Green in County Budget," Contra Costa Times, 7/17/99). Spending $1500 altogether annually per resident, supervisors could easily find $12.50 more for libraries.
	•	SINCE WHEN SHOULD THE ELECTORATE BE BRIBED...? "THAT'S "SHORT-SIGHTED AND SOPHOMORIC...COUNTY LEADERS HAVE BEEN PLAYING THE FIDDLE, WHILE THE [LIBRARY]SYSTEM BURNS" (Times editorial, 7/23/99).
	•	OUTSOURCING LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION WOULD PROVIDE BETTER SERVICE, AT LOWER COST-as Riverside County's comparably sized Library System already demonstrates.
	•	SALES-TAX INCREASES HIT FIXED-INCOME FOLKS HARDEST. And on average, Measure L extracts $50 more annually per family of four.
	•	LOCAL LIBRARIES INCREASINGLY SUBSIDIZE MERE ENTERTAINMENT. Service demands haven't "soared". 
With growing home Internet research, library circulation is dropping. And average circulation-transaction cost (including renewals) already exceeds $3.50!
MEASURE L PROMOTERS ARE AGAIN USING TAX-EXEMPT FUNDS in their professionally orchestrated new-tax campaign. County vendors are "contributing" too - including $10,000 from a trash contractor. We question these practices, and hope you'll join our grass-roots opposition in voting... NO ON L!

<against> Arguments Against Measure L
ARE YOUR TAXES:
1. TOO LOW?
2. HIGH ENOUGH?
3. TOO HIGH?
IF "TOO LOW", VOTE FOR ADDITIONAL TAXES, OTHERWISE, WE RECOMMEND TELLING THE TAX PROMOTERS: "NO ON L!"
WE'RE TAXED ENOUGH NOW TO FUND LIBRARIES. If per capita funding is really "36th of 37 Bay Area library systems", it's not local taxpayers' fault.
BUT POLITICIANS DODGE HARD BUDGET DECISIONS by simply raising taxes. And they raise taxes by exploiting feelings and emotions about popular institutions like libraries, meanwhile spending discretionary funds on something else.
	•	"Just 1/8th of a penny"? Our CURRENT RATE: ALREADY 8.25 pennies grew a fraction of a penny at a time. WE'RE ALREADY TIED FOR SECOND-HIGHEST STATEWIDE, EXCEEDING THE RATES IN 52 OF CALIFORNIA'S 58 COUNTIES!
	•	MEASURE L WOULD RAISE CONTRA COSTA SALES TAXES TO 8.375%. And as Bay Bridge tolls (promised to end in 1956) remind, few things turn out more permanent than "temporary tax increases".
	•	"Just 1/8th of a penny" means $100 MILLION IN NEW TAXES over Measure L's advertised life.
	•	ACCT'S STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT CONSULTANTS HAVE REPEATEDLY OFFERED A DETAILED, NO-FEE EXAMINATION OF CONTRA COSTA'S BUDGET to find money for more library hours, literacy programs, etc. But county politicians have refused the offer, evidently preferring new taxes.
	•	MEANWHILE, "COUNTY GOVERNMENT JOBS ARE PAYING WELL." (Contra Costa Times report, 11/22/98). 133 full-time equivalent County Library employees already AVERAGE $63,390 in taxpayer-provided annual compensation, including 35% in benefit add-ons.
	•	ONLY 6.2% OF MEASURE L BUYS NEW BOOKS AND MATERIALS. The rest goes mostly for additional payroll and benefits...including 90 new positions. 
CALIFORNIAN'S INFLATION-ADJUSTED STATE AND LOCAL TAXES ARE HIGHER NOW THAN BEFORE PROP. 13. If Prop. 39 passes, taxes will go higher still. We must require better utilization of existing funds instead.
PLEASE VOTE NO ON L! <againstend>

<rebutagainst> Rebuttal to Arguments Against
Opponents of Literacy, Learning and Local Libraries attack everything but the facts. The facts remain clear and undisputed. At a time when improving education is critical, our local libraries are in trouble.
Fact: After-school and homework assistance programs have been reduced.
Fact: Literacy programs for children and adults are inadequate.
Fact: Services for seniors are insufficient.
Fact: Libraries are open too few night and weekend hours.
Measure L is an opportunity to tell government exactly how to spend tax dollars, giving you local and personal control over government spending. A Task Force in your area will ensure that funds are used for services and materials most needed locally.
Opponents Argue: Make the libraries more efficient. 
The Truth: One of America's leading auditing firms found that the library is well managed and efficiently operated.
Opponents Argue: Measure L will last forever. 
The Truth: By law, Measure L automatically expires in eight years.
Opponents Argue: Find the money elsewhere. 
The Truth: The issue is the lack of available funds. The Contra Costa County Grand Jury recognized the gravity when more than ten years ago it reported that our library system was failing due to chronic underfunding. Complex state funding requirements prevent the County from allocating more funding to libraries.
The question is simple and straightforward: Is your local branch library and the services it provides worth 1/8 of a penny? We think it is.
