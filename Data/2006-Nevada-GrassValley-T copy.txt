ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF
MEASURE T

The citizens of Grass Valley win with Measure T!

T = safer local streets and more: Potholes are filled. Broken sidewalks
are repaired. Rough streets are resurfaces. Speed Bumps are
installed to slow cars. Traffic congestion is eased and neighborhood
school streets will be safer.

T = Dorsey Drive Interchange completed: Improved, faster and safer
access to the Hospital, the College and High School. Fewer cars on
Brunswick and East Main.

T = a lot more: Building Wolf Creek Parkway. Constructing bicycle
and pedestrian paths. A parking garage that will remove cars from
downtown. A public transit center and bus shelter for all, especially
our seniors and the disabled.

T = accountability: Every Vt cent raised goes only to these specific
projects. An annual independent audit is required and citizens’
oversight committee is formed.

T = V4 cent sales tax: Those who shop in Grass Valley pay, including
folks from other communities, counties and tourists.

T = fair share: The cent sales tax insures we get our fair share
in matching funds from the state and federal government. Why
shouldn’t we?

With Measure T our community wins, our neighborhoods win, our
schools win, our seniors win and our historic downtown wins.

With Measure T and a % cent sales tax we the citizens of Grass Valley
win.

Please join us in voting Yes on Measure T.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE T

T = taxpayer-supported growth.

As an ex-Planning Commissioner and City Fee Committee member,
I’ve seen how developers pass their costs onto taxpayers. It was a
brilliant move to bait this tax measure with promises to Wolf Creek
supporters.

Over proponent objections, ex-councilmember Steve Enos and I
successfully fought for funding guarantees for the Wolf Creek project,
but the measure is still misleading and deeply flawed.

From the State of California’s Department of Transportation document
“Dorsey Drive Interchange Improvement”, March 2006:

“As a project intended to relieve congestion, the Dorsey Drive
interchange may be seen as creating opportunities for new
development. In fact, this interchange is included in a list of capital
improvement projects intended to provide capacity for all new

development in the area"

“...the greatest benefit of the project is a reduction in overall local
network (traffic) delay. With the full interchange, there will be... 9%
less traffic delay than the No-Build scenario.”

Benefit developers? 9% less delay? $28 million cost?

Why aren't proponents telling you this? Because it’s not about
reducing traffic but having taxpayers instead of developers pay for
past and future growth. Reject this tax and Loma Rica and other
developers will rightfully have to help build Dorsey.

This measure divides the community into self-serving segments but
is harmful to the community as a whole.

We have real problems to solve. This hasty harmful tax measure isn't
the solution, it bails out developers. We need an honest approach.

Please vote no!

such indebtedness solely by way of future collection of Sales Taxes for project expenditures.

2)	Maintenance of Effort - The City, by enactment of this Sales Tax Expenditure Plan, intends the funds provided by the Special Sales Tax

auditing, other financial activities and contract services that are necessary and reasonable to carry out its responsibilities pursuant to

8)	Citizen Oversight Committee - If this measure is enacted by the voters, Council shall establish a Citizen Oversight Committee to make
recommendations on project priorities and review the annual audit / report to insure that the proceeds are spent for purposes specified in
the expenditure plan.
