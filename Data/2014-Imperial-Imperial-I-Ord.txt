Municipal Code is hereby amended to read as follows:

“For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to and shall
pay a tax in the amount of ten percent (10%) of the rent charged by the operator.
The tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the City, which is
extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the City. The transient shall
pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is
paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each
installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient’s ceasing to occupy
space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the
hotel, the tax administrator may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the
tax administrator.”

Section 2. Notwithstanding Section 9217 of the California Elections Code,
without a vote of the people, the City Council may do any and all of the following: (i)
repeal this Ordinance; (ii) reduce the rate of the transient occupancy tax below ten
percent (10%); or (iii) increase the rate of the transient occupancy tax to ten percent
(10%) if it has been previously reduced below such rate. In no event shall the City
Council increase the rate of the transient occupancy tax in excess of ten percent (10%)
without approval by a majority of the voters voting in an election on the increase.

Section 3. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of
this Ordinance is for any reason held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of
competent jurisdiction, the remaining portions of this Ordinance shall nonetheless
remain in full force and effect. The People of the City of Imperial hereby declare that
they would have adopted each section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion
of the Ordinance, irrespective of the fact that any one or more sections, subsections
sentences, clauses, phrases, or portions of this Ordinance be declared invalid or
unenforceable.
