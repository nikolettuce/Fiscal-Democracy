COUNTY CLERK / REGISTRAR OF VOTERS
BRANDI L. ORTH

COUNTY OF FRESNO

Dear Registered Voter:

The Statewide Primary Election is rapidly approaching, and we are prepared for your involvement! Election Day, June 3, 2014, gives you
an opportunity to participate in democracy by casting your vote.

This primary election includes races for state offices, Congressional races, county races, the City of Fresno races, state propositions, and
local measures. The California Senate races for Districts 8, 12, and 14 are implementing district boundary changes for the first time since
the 2010 census and re-districting. You can verify what political districts you reside in by going to: www.co.fresno.ca.us/elections. You
will notice that a QR code is on the front cover of this sample ballot, which when scanned by your mobile device, will take you directly to
the County Clerk website to learn a wide variety of information.

June 3, 2014 will be the first time the Top Two Primary Act will be applied to a gubernatorial election. You will note that all the state and
congressional candidates for voter-nominated races, regardless of party, are on each ballot. You may vote for one candidate of your
choice, regardless of their party. After the statewide votes are tabulated the two candidates who receive the most votes, will move on to
the November General Election to be held on November 4, 2014.

Have you noticed the large arrow on the cover of this pamphlet? It points to the name and address of your polling location, printed on the
back cover. This is important information! Please vote at the location chosen for you or vote by mail. If you don’t vote at your assigned
polling location then your name will not appear on the roster. You will be processed as a provisional voter - which means your voted ballot
will be sealed in a pink provisional envelope and not opened until after the election when election officials research your registered voter

There are a few dates which carry great significance in this election:

May 5, 2014 - permanent vote-by-mail ballots and sample ballots will be mailed to voters;

May 5, 2014 through June 3, 2014: you may come into the County Clerk’s office and vote your ballot or take a ballot home;

May 19, 2014 - deadline to become a registered voter in this election

May 27, 2014 - deadline to request a vote-by-mail ballot to be mailed to you

June 3, 2014- ELECTION DAY-from 7:00 am to 8:00 pm.

We welcome your input regarding your voting experience.

You can reach us at 559-600-VOTE (8683) or by e-mail at clerk-elections@co.fresno.ca.us.

Is my polling place accessible?

What kind of support can voters get?

We work hard at getting polling places that are accessible for
all people. But sometimes this is not possible.

To know if your polling place is accessible:

•	Find the access symbol on the
back cover of your Sample Ballot
& Voter's Pamphlet.

•	Look for the word YES or NO near the symbol.

o YES means your polling place is fully accessible,
o NO means your polling place is not accessible.

•	If your current polling place is not accessible, and you
want to vote at an accessible polling place, call us at
least 2 weeks before the election: (559) 600-7353

How do I find my polling place?

Look for the address on the back cover of the Sample Ballot &
Voter's Pamphlet. Or find it at: www.co. fresno.ca.us/elections

Can I vote by mail?

Yes. See the Vote-by-Mail application on the back cover of the
Sample Ballot & Voter's Pamphlet. Or call to request a
Vote-by-Mail ballot: (559) 600-VOTE (8683)

Each polling place has:

•	A wheelchair accessible voting booth,

•	Magnifiers,

•	Pens with grips that are easy to hold,

•	A touchscreen TSX, an accessible voting device to help
you mark your ballot independently and privately.

STATEMENT OF CANDIDATE FOR
UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE, DISTRICT NO. 21
AMANDA RENTERIA

Occupation: Farm Policy Advisor
Education and Qualifications:

I’m a daughter of the Central Valley, a mom, a former high-school teacher, and a
dedicated public servant.

I attended Stanford with the help of student loans and received an education that
gave me more opportunities than my parents had as migrant farmworkers. As your
representative, I will work to ensure that our children have the same opportunities to
succeed — I will fight for universal pre-K and will cut student loan interest rates.

As a working mom, I know the challenges that families face, and in Congress, I will
fight to ease them. I will work to bring about job growth in the Valley, equal pay for
women, and earned paid sick leave so that no family has to choose between caring for
a sick child or paying the bills. I will work to protect our water and bring more water into
the Valley so that we can keep our businesses open and our community healthy.

Unlike our current Congress, I will always protect our seniors and put their interests ahead
of wealthy corporations’ interests so that everyone who works hard can retire with dignity.

Our Valley deserves a representative who knows how hard the Valley is struggling,
and I will never stop working to ease the challenges we face.

I would be honored to have your vote and support.

Endorsed by: the California Democratic Party, the Women’s Political Committee, the
Committee for Hispanic Caucuses, and local labor groups, including the Laborers and
firefighters.

STATEMENT OF CANDIDATE FOR JUDGE OF THE SUPERIOR COURT, OFFICE NO. 15  LISA GAMOIAN AGE: 55 Occupation: Chief of Homicide, Fresno County District Attorney Education and Qualifications:  1 am the Chief Deputy District Attorney specially assigned to prosecute the most violent and dangerous criminals in Fresno County. 1 have proudly served you in that capacity for 24 years.  1 successfully prosecuted numerous Three Strikes and Death Penalty cases. 1 prosecuted Marcus Wesson who was sentenced to death for the murders of his 9 children. As a result, 1 was named California’s Outstanding Prosecutor of the Year. 1 teach Deputy District Attorneys and Police Cadets throughout the State.  Born in Selma, the daughter of a raisin farmer, 1 still operate my late father’s 40 acre farm. 1 know the importance of water to Fresno County and the court’s role in protecting our water rights.  1 graduated from Selma High, Fresno State and Hastings Law School. 1 have a life- long investment in Fresno County. 1 believe in our community with all my heart.  Because 1 am committed to public safety and service, 1 am now running for Superior Court Judge. 1 will work to stop the “revolving door” at the jail that releases an average of 50 criminals a day back onto our streets. 1 have the right experience to dispense the tough and fair justice we the people of Fresno County deserve.	STATEMENT OF CANDIDATE FOR JUDGE OF THE SUPERIOR COURT, OFFICE NO. 15 PHILLIP JARRETT CLINE  Occupation: Deputy District Attorney Education and Qualifications:  It has been my honor to serve you as Deputy District Attorney. As a prosecutor and former police officer obtaining justice for victims of crime has always been my highest priority. My extensive knowledge of both criminal and civil law has prepared me to be a tough, levelheaded, and fair judge.  As your judge 1 will insure that all our citizens have ready access to their justice system. By integrating web-based services, cloud technologies, and smart apps 1 will make our court system more efficient, save taxpayer money, and make our calendars serve you rather than the other way around.  1 want to see our police officers kept on the street rather than waiting for cases in the hallways of the courthouse. 1 want to see our mental health courts expanded so the mentally ill don’t get lost in the justice system. 1 want to see the scope of our veterans courts increased so that justice and dignity is available to those who have served our country.  My endorsements include Assembly Minority leader Connie Conway and Senator Jean Fuller.  It will be an honor for me to continue my public service as your judge. 1 respectfully ask for your vote.
STATEMENT OF CANDIDATE FOR JUDGE OF THE SUPERIOR COURT, OFFICE NO. 15 RACHEL HILL AGE: 50 Occupation: Criminal Law Professor, Civil Attorney, Former Prosecutor Education and Qualifications:  1 am the only candidate with experience in the many areas of law directly affecting our community. My civil and criminal law experience, reputation as a tough prosecutor and trial attorney, and my work teaching Constitutional Law, Ethics, Criminal and Juvenile Law, establish me as the most qualified candidate.  Judges don’t choose which cases they will get. Taxpayers need a judge with broad- based legal and life experience. 1 have that experience, handling cases ranging from gang, armed robbery and homicide to contract, water, and zoning disputes. Candidates who have only prosecution experience or a title of “administrative law judge,” which has them handling only administrative claims, lack the necessary qualifications. 1 am the only candidate with the experience to hit the ground running on day one.  Graduating from Notre Dame Law School in 1990, 1 spent years developing vast experience in civil law with a top Fresno firm. 1 then joined the Fresno County District Attorney’s Office, where 1 was a prosecutor for over ten years, earning Criminal Law Specialist Certification, never losing a trial. 1 have defended constitutional rights of individuals in state and federal courts.  A vote for me is a vote for experience, strength and common sense.	STATEMENT OF CANDIDATE FOR JUDGE OF THE SUPERIOR COURT, OFFICE NO. 15 CHARLES F. MAGILL AGE: 52 Occupation: Attorney Education and Qualifications:  Juris Doctorate from San Joaquin College of Law  Change is coming to the Fresno County judicial system. Prison overcrowding is a reality and the days of “just lock them up” are behind us. Almost all of the seated judges are former career prosecutors and that has served us well in the past, however, these new realities are going to require a commitment to be tough on crime and the ability to look outside-of-the-box to insure justice.  My 25 years of experience in the private sector makes me well qualified for the office of judge. As an experienced attorney and legal analyst 1 bring a new and independent perspective to the bench.  1 believe passionately in the rights the Constitution has identified. 1 have courageously fought in court for the rights of religious freedom and free speech and have been recognized for my work by the Pacific Justice Institute.  My wife and business partner, Laura Guzman Magill, a successful attorney who recently passed away from a battle with breast cancer always agreed with my philosophy that a defense attorney is the ultimate defender of our Constitutional rights.  1 appreciate vour vote.www.maqillforjudqe.com

FR 045-015

STATEMENT OF CANDIDATE FOR JUDGE OF THE SUPERIOR COURT, OFFICE NO. 15 STEVEN D. SMITH  Occupation: Administrative Law Judge II Education and Qualifications:  My family came to Fresno County in 1965. 1 grew up during a time when our doors did not need to be locked and everyone knew their neighbors. Our values remain the same, but our community continues to change. We need firm compassionate judges to deal with Fresno’s crime rates. Judges also need to appreciate the diverse nature of our citizens as well as our business community.  While in college at Fresno State, 1 worked for U.S. Senator Pete Wilson. As a criminal defense attorney for almost 20 years, 1 represented clients in thousands of cases in half of the counties of this state, as well as several federal courts.  1 have served the people as an Administrative Law Judge for the past five years. As an ALJ 1 have made tough and well-reasoned decisions that have affected the lives of the thousands of citizens. As your next Superior Court Judge, 1 will continue to make tough well-reasoned decisions.  1 am the only local conservative candidate with extensive judicial training and experience. 1 ask for your vote on June 3rd.	
	

STATEMENT OF CANDIDATE FOR COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS JIM YOVINO AGE: 57 Occupation: Fresno County Superintendent of Schools Education and Qualifications:  Fresno is our home. Born and raised here, 1 attended and graduated from the public schools in our County. After serving as Deputy Superintendent under Larry Powell for several years, 1 was proud to be appointed in June 2013 as your Fresno County Superintendent of Schools. Now in my 23rd year in education, 1 believe that a variety of opportunities for students, business-school partnerships and participation by the community are critical elements to student success. Our teachers, administrators and school staff absolutely cannot do it alone. 1 am a strong advocate for Career Technical Education, and promoting the Arts. Students deserve the opportunity to discover their passions, as they prepare for higher education and/or to enter the work force. Many of the unique challenges we face in Fresno County carry a tremendous impact on our children, specifically poverty and homelessness. 1 believe education is the ultimate equalizer and is a crucial component for our students’ success, at any age, including preparing our students to enter school with Early Care in Education. 1 would be honored to receive your vote so that 1 may continue my work. Together we can change the lives of our children, one future at a time.

Management Services

I have over 25 years of financial management experience in the private sector as
a CPA and business owner that I can bring to Fresno County as your next Assessor.
During my career, I have developed an expertise in business ethics, finance, and
management. As a small business owner, I use this expertise to help local business
owners increase efficiency and expand. I have also served as the CEO of Central
California Blood Center with an annual budget of over $10 million and 125 employees.

couple of years. I vow to ensure it keeps that promise, and I hope to earn your vote.

ELIZABETH A. EGAN

Education and Qualifications:

I am honored to serve as your District Attorney and to be Law Enforcement’s Choice.
I’m proud that our Conviction Rates are higher than the state average.

Fresno County Sheriff Margaret Mims endorses me. We work together every day to
stamp out gangs and crime. The Fresno Deputy Sheriffs Association, Crime Victims
United, Fresno Sheriff Correctional Sergeants Association, and more than 30,000 Peace
Officers statewide endorse me. They know I protect victims and lock up criminals.

Fresno’s Mike Reynolds, the father of California’s Three Strikes law, endorses me.
He knows I enforce Three Strikes.

This campaign is about who has the commitment and proven track record to put
violent criminals in prison and keep you safe. Our conviction rates are higher because
I beefed up the county’s Homicide, Sexual Assault; and Gang Prosecution units;
established an Elder Abuse Unit; expanded the Consumer Protection Division; added
an Identity Theft unit and lead our Multi-Agency Gang Enforcement group.

COUNTY OF FRESNO
FRESNO COUNTY ABANDONED VEHICLE ABATEMENT PROGRAM

MEASURE A

Should the Fresno County Vehicle Abatement Program and vehicle registration fees
(one dollar per vehicle and an additional two dollars for certain commercial vehicles
payable upon registration of a vehicle) be renewed for a ten-year term beginning
July 1, 2014, for the abatement and removal of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or
inoperative vehicles?

YES OR NO

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL

Sections 22710 and 9250.7 of the California Vehicle Code authorize the establishment
of the Fresno County Abandoned Vehicle Authority (AVA), as well as the imposition of a
fee on all vehicles registered in Fresno County. The fee, which is referred to as the AVA
Fee, is charged at a rate of one dollar ($1.00) per vehicle, and two dollars ($2.00) for cer-
tain commercial vehicles, registered in Fresno County. The California Department of Mo-
tor Vehicles (DMV) collects the AVA Fee, and then disburses them to the AVA. The AVA
Fees may only be used for the abatement, removal, and disposal of any abandoned,
wrecked, dismantled, or inoperative vehicles, or vehicle parts, located on private or pub-
lic property within Fresno County. The AVA Fee must be renewed every ten (10) years.

In compliance with state law regarding the imposition of this type of fee, the Board of
Supervisors ordered that Measure A be placed on the ballot for the electors of Fresno
County to consider whether to renew the existing AVA Fee.

AYES vote would authorize the DMV to continue collecting the AVA Fee in the amount of
one dollar ($1.00) for every vehicle registered in Fresno County, and two dollars ($2.00)
for certain commercial vehicles registered in Fresno County, for a term often (10) years.

A NO vote would mean that the DMV would stop collecting the AVA Fee effective
July 1,2014.

s/Kevin B. Briggs
County Counsel

FISCAL IMPACT STATEMENT

This ballot measure is to extend the current Abandoned Vehicle Abatement Program
and vehicle registration fees (one dollar per vehicle and an additional two dollars for
certain commercial vehicles payable upon registration of a vehicle), which expires on
June 30, 2014.

This ordinance will generate approximately seven hundred thousand dollars annually
($700,000) with the growth of this revenue generally following the economic trends with-
in the local community.

The revenue from this Abandoned Vehicle Abatement Program will be used exclusive-
ly for the abatement, removal, and disposal, as a public nuisance, of an abandoned,
wrecked, dismantled, or inoperative vehicle or part of the vehicle from private or public
property; and for the recovery or assumption by the service authority, of costs associated
with the enforcement of the ordinance. Cost recovery shall only be undertaken by an

entity that may be a county or city or the department, pursuant to contract with the ser-
vice authority. If approved, the Abandoned Vehicle Abatement Program will be extended
for a ten-year period, ending June 30, 2024.

sA/icki Crow, CPA
Auditor-Controller/Treasurer-Tax Collector

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE A

Vote Yes on Measure A to continue an important local program for all residents of Fres-
no County and its 15 cities through the Fresno County Abandoned Vehicle Abatement
(AVA) program. Voting Yes on Measure A will not create a new fee but will continue for
an additional ten-vear period the same fee that has been collected since 2004. Since
the program began, over 35,800 abandoned vehicles have been removed. Removal of
abandoned vehicles helps reduce risks to the environment, remove safety hazards and
maintain the visual beauty of our communities. Risks to the environment include fluids
leaking or rust leaching from abandoned vehicles that can enter waterways or habitats
through drainage systems. Vehicles abandoned in roadways present safety hazards for
other motorists and pedestrians by occupying a portion of a roadway or shoulder. Aban-
doned or wrecked vehicles left on our roadways and open areas in our communities and
rural areas are an eyesore.

The AVA program is responsive to resident complaints and results in proper removal of
abandoned vehicles. The Fresno County AVA program started as a ten-year program
in 2004. Since 2004, all of us who register vehicles in Fresno County have paid a $1
annual fee per vehicle and $2 annual fee for certain commercial vehicles.

The City Councils of all 15 cities have adopted resolutions urging the Board of Super-
visors to place the extension of the abandoned vehicle abatement fee on the ballot.
County and city budgets are stretched thin. There is simply no money in existing local
budgets to replace the approximately $700,000/year generated by the abandoned vehi-
cle abatement fee, and without a renewal of the fee abandoned vehicles will accumulate
throughout the county and within its cities. Vote Yes on Measure A.

★ Update your voter registration! ★

When is the deadline to register to vote or update my registration?

The deadline is 15 days before an election.

When do I have to update my voter registration information?

Fill out a new voter registration form if you:

★	Move to a new address,

★	Change your mailing address,

★	Change your name,

★	Are released from prison and complete parole,

★	Would like to change your political party, or

★	Feel your signature has changed.

What happens if I do NOI update my information?

Your name may not be on the Roster of Voters at the polls on Election Day. That means you may
have to vote a provisional ballot, which may not have all of the candidates or measures that are on
the ballot for your current address.

If we do not have your current mailing address, the post office will not forward your election mail.
Why update my signature?

We are aware that signatures may change over time and submitting a new voter registration card will
update our records with your most up to date signature. This is quite significant as, for example, our
office uses the signature to verify the identity of every voter on Vote-by-Mail ballots and petitions.

Where can I get a voter registration form?

You can get a voter registration form at:

★	At our elections office, 2221 Kern Street, Fresno, CA 93721

★	Any public library,

★	Any fire station,

★	Your local DMV office, or

★	Electronically at: reaistertovote.ca.gov.

Information for Voters Voting at the Polls

What happens when I go to the polls on Election Day?

•	First, a precinct officer will ask you to state your name and address out loud.

•	Second, you will be asked to sign the Roster of Voters.

•	Third, the precinct officer will give you a ballot and secrecy sleeve and direct you to a voting booth.

•	Finally, you mark your ballot and deposit it in the ballot box.

If you need assistance with the voting process, ask the precinct officer to help you.

Do I need identification to vote?

The only voters who will be asked for ID at the polls are those who registered by mail but didn’t provide a drivers’ license number on the
registration form and are voting for the first time for a federal office.

What if my name isn’t on the Roster of Voters or I don’t have my Vote-By-Mail ballot to surrender?

If your name is not on the Roster of Voters at the polling place, or you are a Vote-by-Mail voter, but do not have your ballot to surrender,
a precinct officer will offer you a “provisional ballot”.

What is a “provisional ballot”?

A “provisional ballot” is an official ballot that the voter gets at the polls and puts inside a special pink envelope after they have signed
the provisional roster. The voter fills out and signs the form on the envelope, and returns it to a precinct officer. The ballot inside the
envelope is counted after Election Day provided the voter is registered to vote in Fresno County and has not voted elsewhere in that
election. Provisional voters get a receipt with a phone number they can call no sooner than 40 days after the election to check if their
ballot was counted.

Why would my name not be printed on the Roster of Voters at the polls?

The most common reasons are:

•	You are in the wrong polling place, or

•	You changed your name and did not re-register to vote, or

•	You moved into Fresno County or moved to a new precinct within Fresno County but did not re-register to vote, or

•	You never registered or you registered after the deadline.

NOTE: Election mail cannot be forwarded. Be sure to re-register to vote if you move or change your name, otherwise you will not receive
election mail and your name may not be on the Roster at your polling place.
