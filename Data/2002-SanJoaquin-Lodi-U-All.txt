IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE U
Prepared by City Attorney

This ballot measure requests that the voters approve an
increase in the City’s Hotel-Motel Occupancy Tax. This tax is
paid by those persons who occupy a hotel or motel room for a
period of less than 30 days. The current rate of collection for
this tax is 9%. The new rate of collection, if approved, would
be 10%. The current rate of collection has been in place
since 1991. It generates approximately $429,756.00 ip
revenue per year. At the 10% rate, approximately $47,756.00
of additional annual revenue would be collected. The money
collected from this tax is placed in the City’s General Fund.
Money from the General Fund is used to provide overall
services in the following approximate percentages; Public
Safety (Police and Fire) 42%; General Government 27%;
Leisure, Cultural and Social Services 13%; Community and
Economic Development 11%; and Transportation 7%. Since
this tax is a general tax, the vote needed to approve the
increase is a simple majority (50%+1) of those voting on the
measure.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure U. If
you desire a copy of the measure, please call the Lodi City
Clerk’s office at (209) 333-6702 and a copy will be mailed at
no cost to you.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE U

Our organizations stand together in support of increasing the
Hotel-Motel tax from 9% to 10%. This tax is NOT a tax on
citizens of Lodi but placed on the out of town visitor to our
City. It is assessed them when they stay at a local hotel or
motel.

The revenue generated by this Tax goes into our City’s
general fund. The general fund supports City services such as
police, fire, economic development and parks and recreation.
In addition, the City’s general fund has contributed funds to
{ The Lodi Chamber of Commerce, The Downtown Lodi

I I Business Partnership and The Lodi Conference & Visitors
Bureau. These organizations support the community through
business attraction and assistance, tourism, and Downtown
I promotions and events.

I When visitors come to Lodi, their spending contributes to our
I local economy. We believe the proposed small increase in the
| Hotel-Motel Occupancy Tax will benefit and enhance
" programs and services to the community while having a
I nominal impact to visitors,

I The Chamber and its Board of Directors represent 650
businesses in Lodi. The Downtown Lodi Business Partnership
has over 200 members including Downtown merchants. The
Lodi Conference and Visitors Bureau has many partners and
constituents.

We urge you to VOTE YES on Ordinance No. 1714. Thank
I You.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE U

The undersigned hotel-motel owners and operators are
against increasing the occupancy tax from 9% to 10%.

Since we all want to attract visitors to Lodi, it does not make
sense to require them to pay a higher occupancy tax, when
those same tourist dollars might be spent in the community
for food, gasoline, winery tours, entertainment, etc.

Cherokee Lane hotel-motel owners are still burdened by
revitalization assessments, school bond raises are being
added to our property taxes, utility costs have risen, and since
9/11, our commercial insurance costs have tripled in some
cases. Those costs increase room rates, and a 10%
occupancy tax will further discourage tourists.

Please help Lodi’s small hotel-motel owner/operatdrs to stay
in business.

We urge you to vote NO on Lodi city ordinance No. 1714.

THANK YOU.

ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE U

NO REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST
MEASURE U WAS SUBMITTED

With our winery tours, street fairs, festivals, and other special
events, the tourist dollars brought to Lodi are becoming
increasingly important to local businesses. By charging the
highest occupancy tax in the county, Lodi penalizes the
visitors we want to attract.

in 1991, a surcharge of three percent was added to the
existing six percent occupancy tax. That temporary tax, of
course, did not go away and has never been approved by the
voters of Lodi. With this proposed increase, that temporary
tax now becomes permanent.

By providing jobs, goods, and services, businesses are the
life-blood of our community. While Cherokee Lane
hotel/motel occupancy rates are dropping, our costs are
rising. We are paying an assessment for the revitalization of
Cherokee Lane, property taxes have gone up, utility costs
have increased, and since 9/11 some insurance costs have
been raised to three times the previous amount.

Increasing the occupancy tax rate is bad for local business
and bad for Lodi’s prosperity. Please vote NO.
