Impartial Analysis of Measure
by Robert Winston, City Attorney

j

This amendment to section 3.28.030 of the Weed Municipal Code
would increase from 6% to 8% the "Transient Occupancy Tax". That
tax is added to the charges for hotel and motel rooms, inns, R-V
Parks, and other short-term commercial accommodations in the
city, collected by the owners of such businesses, and all of it
is paid to the city.

If the measure passes, the 6% would continue to go into the
general fund of the city, to be spent for police, fire, roads,
public utilities, and other city expenses, but the additional 2%
could be used by the city only for promotion, community events,
economic enhancement, and community beautification.

Currently, the city receives some $88,000 from the tax. It is
expected that the increase will result in an about $29,000 in ad-
ditional revenues to the city for the specified purposes.

The City of Yreka has already increased their Transient Occupancy
Tax by the same amount as requested here, and the City of Mt.
Shasta will have a similar measure on its ballot concurrently
with this one.

Because the increase in the tax is to be for a special purpose,
as opposed to mere general revenue, a 2/3 affirmative vote is
remiired.

Robert Winston,
City Attorney

MEASURE "E"
The Motel Tax

QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE

ON MEASURE "E1

The Motel Tax

Let tourists help us promote and beautify
the City of Weed. On the June 5th ballot.
Weed voters will be asked to approve a 2%
tax increase in the motel tax paid by motel
visitors here in Weed.

THIS INCREASE WILL NOT
COST WEED RESIDENTS A
SINGLE DIME.

This increase will make Weed's
motel tax equal to communities
such as Yreka, Redding,
Crescent City, Eureka,
and Red Bluff.

It is paid solely by tourists using motel
accomodations in Weed. This 2% increase will
benefit all Weed residents because it will be used
solely for:

1.	City Promotion

2.	Economic enhancement-
(bringing new employers
to Weed)

3.	Community Beautification

4.	Community Events

We need your helpl
Please support Measure "E",
the motel tax.

REMEMBER-
IT WON'T COST WEED
RESIDENTS A SINGLE DIMEI

Q.- How much money will the 2%
yield?

Approximately $26,000 annually.

Q.- How will the money be
distributed?

The money will go into a specially marked account.
Those who have a plan to help promote, beautify
or improve Weed can apply to the City Council
for funding of their project.

Q.- Can the money be used for any
city project?

Only those that are specifically defined for
promotion, beautification, community events, or
economic enhancement.

Q.- Won't the increase in tax keep
people from staying in Weed?

NO. Tourists are used to paying 8% or more in most
other towns. The 2% tax increase in Weed would
add only 600 to the average $30.00 room rental.

Q.- Will the tax hurt the
local motels?

NO. The tax is paid by the motel guest. The motels
and other tourist related businesses will benefit by
the overall improvement in Weed—plusthe added
promotion of our community.

Q.- Are you SURE this isn't going to
cost Weed residents?

YES. Unless they stay at a local
motel, this tax increase will not
cost any Weed resident a dime.

TO THE VOTERS OF WEED

AN INCREASE IN THE TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX (TOT) WILL HAVE NO
EFFECT ON LOCAL TAXPAYERS. THE TOT IS A MOTEL TAX THAT IS PAID BY
OUT-OF-TOWN TRAVELERS AS THEY STAY IN OUR LOCAL MOTELS. RIGHT NOW,'
THE CITY OF WEED IS COLLECTING A 6% TAX. YET AROUND THE STATE, MOST
LOCALITIES ARE CHARGING 8% OR MORE AT THEIR MOTELS.	SO OUR

CITIZENS ARE GENERALLY PAYING A HIGHER TAX WHEN THEY ARE TRAVELING
OUT OF TOWN, THAN THOSE VISITORS STAYING HERE. WE ARE PROPOSING
AN INCREASE IN OUR TOT FROM 6% TO 8%. THIS MONEY IS TO BE USED
SOLELY FOR CITY PROMOTION, COMMUNITY EVENTS, ECONOMIC ENHANCEMENT,
AND COMMUNITY BEAUTIFICATION.

THE TAX WOULD BE COLLECTED FROM THE MOTELS AND PUT INTO A
RESTRICTED CITY FUND. AT BUDGET TIME, ANY GROUP OR ORGANIZATION
COULD APPLY FOR FUNDING FOR THEIR CIVIC PROJECT. IMPROVEMENTS
COULD INCLUDE NEW DOWNTOWN LIGHTING, FLOWER BOXES, SIDEWALK
IMPROVEMENTS, DRINKING FOUNTAIN'S, TRASH CONTAINERS, PARKING
FACILITIES, BUILDING FACADES, AND OTHER ATTRACTIONS UNIQUE TO OUR
COMMUNITY.

SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS COULD BE MADE TO ATTRACT OTHER EMPLOYERS TO OUR
AREA. THE IDEAS ARE ENDLESS. BUT IDEAS TAKE MONEY, YET AN
INCREASE IN THE TOT IS TOTALLY PAINLESS TO OUR LOCAL TAXPAYERS.

HELP WEEDS FUTURE, SUPPORT MEASURE E. A YES VOTE WILL BE YOUR FREE
TICKET TO A BETTER COMMUNITY.
