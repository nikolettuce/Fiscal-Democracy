SPALDING COMMUNITY SERVICES DISTRICT,
VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT SPECIAL TAX

This measure would authorize the Spalding Community
Services District, Volunteer Fire Department, (“the District”)
to repeal the 1998 special tax and enact a new special
tax on all taxable real property and structures within the
District. The tax levied will be seventy dollars ($70.00) per
taxable improved parcels located within the District, per
year, for improved parcels containing a structure existing
thereon, other than a storage building consisting of less
than 100 square feet, or a parcel to which a sewer and/
or water connection has been provided which facilitates
occupancy of the property through a recreational vehicle
or in any other manner. Unimproved parcels shall be
taxed at the rate of twenty-six dollars ($26.00) per taxable
parcel, per year. This measure will take effect beginning
with the 2013-2014 fiscal year. The special tax shall be
used solely for the purpose of providing fire suppression,
protection, prevention, rescue, ambulance and other
emergency services within the District which the District
is authorized by law to provide, for any responses outside
of the District under mutual aid agreements with other fire
suppression or emergency service agencies and for any
incidental expense relating thereto including expenses
related to the collection of the tax. The taxes will be
collected on the County of Lassen property tax bill in the
same manner and subject to the same penalty as the
county property taxes are collected. Any property owner
who is assessed a special tax as provided for herein may
appeal any determination by the District concerning the
nature of the use of the property or the calculation of the
amount of the tax by filing a notice of appeal with the
District office. This measure will pass if two-thirds of the
registered voters of the Spalding Community Services
District cast a “Yes” vote. If the measure does not pass,
the existing special tax will remain as previously approved
by the voters on February 3, 1998.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of
Measure “V”, If you desire a copy of the measure,
please call the elections official’s office at 530-251-
8217 and a copy will be faxed or mailed at no cost to
you.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE V

Fire Department funding comes strictly from a fire
assessment tax that has not been changed since
its inception in 1985. Much of the fire equipment is
aging and will, in the near future, need to be replaced.
With the current tax structure, the District collects
approximately $30,000 which only pays for worker’s
comp insurance, administrative overhead, utilities and
vehicle maintenance. If this tax assessment is approved,
the Fire Department would collect about $63,000 per
year. This will allow us to buy needed small equipment
and firefighting tools, pay for fire related expenses and
begin to save for capital replacement of equipment in the
future. Without this new tax, the fire department will not
have sufficient funding to operate next fiscal year and
will have to drastically cut from their already lean budget.
No firefighters are paid for their services! State grants
usually require a 50% match which the Fire Department
can no longer afford. Our volunteer Fire Fighters respond
to approximately 35 medical emergencies and several
fire and accident calls each year. They need this funding
to continue their valuable work!
