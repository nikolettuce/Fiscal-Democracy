<full> ORDINANCE NO. 3106

AN ORDINANCE AMENDING CHAPTER 3.32
OF THE TUOLUMNE COUNTY ORDINANCE CODE
AMENDING THE TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX
BY INCREASING THE TAX RATE FROM
EIGHT PERCENT (8%) TO TEN PERCENT (10%)

TO TAKE EFFECT UPON THE APPROVAL OF A
MAJORITY OF THE VOTERS VOTING ON THE ORDINANCE

The tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the county which is extinguished only by payment to the operator

paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be due upon the transient’s ceasing to occupy space in the

shall be paid directly to the tax collector.

the unincorporated area of the County on this ordinance at an election to be held on June 8, 2010 and the approval

<impartial> IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL
MEASURE A

This ballot measure, if adopted by County voters,
would amend the Tuolumne County Ordinance Code by
raising the Transient Occupancy Tax rate from the current
rate of eight percent (8%) to ten percent (10%). This
ballot measure also requires that the voters within the
Sonora City Limits approve a similar ordinance setting
the Transient Occupancy Tax rate at ten percent (10%) in
order for the County’s ordinance to become effective. If1
adopted by County voters and the voters within the Sonora
City Limits, the increase to the Transient Occupancy Tax
rate would take effect on October 1, 2010.

The Transient Occupancy Tax is a tax paid by
hotel and motel guests who spend fewer than thirty (30)
consecutive days in a hotel or motel in the County of
Tuolumne. The tax is on the room rent paid and is paid
by the person renting the room. For example, a hotel
guest currently pays Eight Dollars ($8.00) tax per night
on a One Hundred Dollar ($100.00) hotel room. If the
ballot measure is adopted, the hotel guest would pay Ten
Dollars ($10.00) tax per night on a One Hundred Dollar
($100.00) hotel room.

One hundred percent (100%) of the transient
occupancy tax collected goes into the County’s general
fund which can be spent at the discretion of the Board
of Supervisors. The increase of the Transient Occupancy
Tax rate from eight percent (8%) to ten percent (10%)
would raise additional revenue in the approximate amount
of Three Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($350,000.00)
that would be placed into the County’s general fund. 

This ballot measure proposes a “general tax”
as defined in Article XIII C of the California Constitution.
Accordingly, in order for the ballot measure to be adopted,
it must receive a majority “yes” vote. A “Yes” vote on
this ballot measure means that you want to increase
the Transient Occupancy Tax rate from its current eight
percent (8%) to ten percent (10%). A “No” vote means
that you want the Transient Occupancy Tax rate to remain
at its current eight percent (8%).


This analysis is submitted by the Office of the
County Counsel of the County of Tuolumne pursuant to
the requirements of Section 9160 of the Elections Code
of the State of California.<impartialend>

<fiscal> FINANCIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY AUDITOR-
CONTROLLER

MEASURE A

This ballot measure, if adopted by County voters, would
amend the Tuolumne County Ordinance Code by raising
the Transient Occupancy Tax rate from the current rate of
eight percent (8%) to ten percent (10%) and applying the
Transient Occupancy Tax.

Assumption:

County Hotel/Motel revenues are based upon Fiscal year
2008-09 annual receipts of $1,417,800 with no growth.

Financial increase to Tuolumne County General Fund:

Fiscal year 2010-11 (9 months)	$265,850

Fiscal year 2011 -12 and thereafter $354,450

This analysis is submitted by the Office of the Auditor-
Controller of the County of Tuolumne pursuant to the
requirements of Section 9160(c) of the Elections Code of
the State of California.

<favor> ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE A

Measure A is a true “win-win” proposition for
everyone in Tuolumne County. Measure A will generate
approximately $350,000 annually by increasing from 8%
to 10% the “transient occupancy tax” (TOT) that visitors
pay to stay in hotels and inns.

The additional revenues Measure A generates
will be paid by tourists, not local taxpayers. All of that
new money will go into the general fund of Tuolumne
County to support such things as:

•	Law enforcement

•	Fire protection
» Road maintenance

•	Recreation

•	Libraries

•	Tourism promotion

Given the historic drop in revenues to local
government, it is more important than ever to ensure
visitors to our community pay for the services they
utilize.

Won’t increasing the TOT cause a drop in visitation
to the County? No! Few people ever look at the TOT rate
they pay and if they did, they would not be alarmed. The
10% rate proposed is equal to the statewide average and
less than that charged at most major destinations To
the extent some of the TOT currently goes to help fund
tourism, the TOT actually helps promote Tuolumne
County.

Why is promotion of Tuolumne County important?
Jobs - Jobs - Jobs. Tourism is one of our most
important economic forces and prime sources of
jobs. Tourists spend millions of dollars each year that
sustains many local businesses. This in turn generates
tax dollars that help fund essential local government jobs
and services. Tourism provides a significant return on
investment.

Measure A helps fund essential government
services, promotes Tuolumne County, and generates
local jobs. That is why Measure A is supported by
the Tuolumne County Lodging Association Tuolumne
County Visitors Bureau, Tuolumne County Chamber of
Commerce, Yosemite Chamber of Commerce, Tuolumne
County Business Council and many others. <favorend>
