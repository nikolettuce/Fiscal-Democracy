IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE A

By Raymond G. Fortner, Jr., County Counsel

Approval of Measure A would authorize the Little Lake City Elementary School
District (“District”) to levy a qualified special tax of $145 per year on any parcel
of land which lies wholly or partially in the District.

The tax revenues would be used to maintain health services to students, maintain
small class sizes, retain high quality teachers, and maintain safe, clean campuses.

The tax would be levied for seven (7) years. A person age 65 or older may apply
for an exemption if they occupy the parcel. All property that would otherwise be
exempt from property taxes will also be exempt. A parcel is any unit of land in
the District which receives a separate tax bill. The taxes under this Measure shall
be collected by the Los Angeles County Treasurer and Tax Collector at the same
time and manner and shall be subject to the same penalties as general ad
valorem property taxes collected by the Tax Collector. The tax shall bear the rate
for unpaid ad valorem property taxes until paid. Any tax levied shall become a
lien upon the properties against which taxes are assessed and collectible.

In each year, the Board of Trustees (“Board”) for the District shall provide for
any increase in the District’s appropriations limit as shall be necessary to ensure
that proceeds of the qualified special tax may be spent for authorized purposes.
The Board shall file an annual report pursuant to Government Code section
50075.3 accounting for the parcel tax revenues collected and the manner in which
they have been spent, and appoint an independent community oversight
committee to oversee all expenditures funded by the measure to ensure that
funds are spent wisely and used only for purposes approved by the voters. The
District shall create a designated account into which the proceeds of the tax shall
be deposited. The collection of the qualified special tax shall not decrease funds
available from other sources of the District in any period from the effective date.

This Measure requires a two-thirds (2/3) vote for passage.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE A

The Little Lake City School District has a longstanding reputation for offering
excellent educational opportunities to K-8 students in our community.
“Recognizing that children come first,” we are committed to providing a well-
rounded and high-quality education in a safe environment that results in student
learning. Our success as a school district enhances the image of our community
and contributes to property values.

Our tradition of excellence in education is now threatened. In recent years, the
state’s fiscal crisis has caused the district to cut spending by nearly 10%. Through
conservative fiscal planning, these cuts have been made as far away from the
classroom as possible.

Now, as enrollment in district schools temporarily declines, we will lose an
additional $1.25 million in funding next year, which will result in teacher layoffs
and larger class sizes.

In order to preserve the quality of education our students deserve, additional
support from the Little Lake community is needed.

Measure A provides needed local funding for the district that will make the
difference in our ability to continue and maintain:

Small Class Sizes;

Safe and Clean Campuses;

Health Services for Students;

Qualified Teachers Without Layoffs.

Measure A will meet the immediate funding crisis and will expire after seven
years as enrollment increases.

With Measure A:

Each parcel owner pays less than 40 cents a day.

All funds will be used on your local Little Lake schools for the benefit of district
students.

Not one cent will be used on administrator salaries or benefits.

No Funds can be taken by the State.

Senior Citizen Exemptions are available.

Citizens’ oversight committee will ensure that Measure A funds are directed only
on services for students.

Join us in investing in the future of our community by voting YES on Measure A.
