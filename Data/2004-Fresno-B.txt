<impartial> IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL

State law authorizes a county board of supervisors to propose a special
countywide sales tax ("transactions and use tax") for public library
construction, acquisition, programs, and operations within the county. The
tax proposal may be at the rate of either 0.125 or 0.25 percent for up to 16
years. The board of supervisors may also propose a tax in any succeeding
period at either rate for up to 16 years.

In 1998, the Fresno County Board of Supervisors proposed, and the voters
approved, a special library sales tax at the rate of 0.125 percent for 7 years.
This tax became operative on April 1, 1999, and will expire on March 31.
2006.

The Fresno County Board of Supervisors has adopted an ordinance which
would impose a successor special library sales tax on the same terms as the
existing ordinance: the tax would be imposed at the rate of 0.125 percent for
7 years, if two-thirds of the voters voting on the measure approved. If this
measure were to be approved by the voters, the successor tax would become
operative on April 1,2006 and would expire on March 31,2013. Because this
tax would succeed an expiring tax at the same rate, the sales tax rate in
Fresno County would not change if the voters approved this tax.

The tax revenues would be shared by the two public library entities in Fresno
County according to their proportions of County population, with about 97
percent going to the Fresno County Free Library, and about 3 percent to the
Coalinga-Huron Library District. The ordinance provides that one adjustment
for any change in population proportions would occur approximately halfway
through the 7-year term of the tax.

The proceeds from this tax could only be used for public library purposes,
and could only be used to supplement, not supplant, existing funding for the
support of public libraries. The specific expenditure plan in the ordinance
calls for the following activities:

1.	Continuing the current increased open hours, and increasing open
hours further where possible;

2.	Continuing to replace worn and out-of-date books and materials,
and continuing to add new books and other materials;

3.	Continuing the current expanded programs and services, and
expanding programs and services further, for children, young adults


and adults;

4.	Continuing the reestablished locally funded literacy services at the
County Library;

5.	Maintaining library buildings; and

6.	Constructing new libraries or remodeling and expanding existing
libraries.

The tax revenues would also be used to reimburse the County for election
costs and to pay the fees charged by the state in administering the tax.

The Fresno County Board of Supervisors and the governing board of the
Library District would be responsible for the specific expenditures of their
respective shares of the tax revenues, under the general laws governing each
type of entity. The Citizens Review Panel established by the Board of
Supervisors to monitor the County Library's expenditures under the current
tax would continue to do so for the new tax. <impartialend>

FISCAL IMPACT STATEMENT

This ballot measure is to extend the current Retail Transaction and Use Tax in
the incorporated and unincorporated areas of Fresno County at the rate of
one-eight of one percent (0.125%), which expires on March 31, 2006. The
State Board of Equalization will continue to administer this sales tax if
approved by at least two-thirds of the electors voting on the measure.

This ordinance will generate approximately twelve million five-hundred
thousand dollars annually ($12,500,000) with the growth of this revenue
generally following the economic trends within the local community.

The revenue from this Public Library Transactions and Use Tax Ordinance will
be used exclusively for public library services within Fresno County. This tax
will terminate on the later date of March 31, 2013 or 7 years after the first day
of the first calendar quarter following the execution of the State Board of
Equalization amended contract in accordance with the provisions of the
Transactions and Use Tax Ordinance.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR

Ballot Argument in favor of Measure B Measure B is not a new tax but simply
a continuation of existing funding sources!

In 1998, Measure B was passed by over 70% of the voters in Fresno County.
The message was clear: Voters wanted more hours and books; improved
literacy and more children’s and senior services. The citizens supported
Measure B because it guaranteed a local funding source that would provide
these services and also help finance improvements to library facilities in
Fresno County.

Measure B made a promise. The promise has been kept!

As proposed: Our libraries are now open twice as long, computer upgrades
are now complete in all branches giving each branch Internet access. More
than 500,000 new books and 800 magazine subscriptions have been added
by our library system. Library use has increased dramatically. Branch facilities
have been built or improved in Caruthers, Central, Clovis, Fig Garden,
Kerman, Kingsburg, Laton, Mendota, Piedra, Pinedale, Riverdale, San
Joaquin, Sanger, Sunnyside, Woodward Park, the Literacy Center and in the
Coalinga-Huron District. Measure B has opened the door to state matching
funds for construction.

What happens without Measure B?

Without Measure B, the results will be devastating! Hours will be reduced by
50%, cutting evening hours and weekend time, creating shorter days at most
locations. New books and materials purchases, online resources, and teen
and children’s programs will be severely reduced. Literacy, seniors and
daycare center services will be eliminated. Improvements and construction at
many facilities will not happen.

We cannot stop now. Let’s keep moving forward!

A Yes Vote on Measure B means local control of our library system with the
hours, books and services we want. Libraries have improved the quality of
life in our county.

For continued improvement in libraries and literacy without a new tax, please
vote Yes on Measure B!

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR

Supporters of the library tax have claimed succedss by simply saying that
THEY SPEND THE MONEY THEY WERE GIVEN. Wonderful! But what
tangible benefits have accrued from the expenditures? Has this tax resulted
in increased literacy? Has this tax resulted in greater economic
development? Has this tax resulted in decreased unemployment?

The library is bigger, they say. True enough, with the sparkling new
supersized Woodward Park unit that consumed a large chunk of the tax
money.

The library is open longer and serves more people, they say. Certainly, with
extensive media advertisements that could have generated greater use
WITHOUT the tax.

The library has more books and magazines, they say. That’s fine with regard
to government documents and reference volumes. But should the
government subsidize the private use of popular books and magazines that
are sold commercially at very modest prices?

Is it wrong to ask the users of a service to shoulder the lion’s share of the
costs of that service? What about outsourcing some services? What about
asking users to pay a modest increase in per-use or periodic fees? What
about increased fundraising from individuals, businesses, and
philanthropies?

Does the answer to every perceived problem in Fresno County have to
be a tax increase? For information on alternatives to increasing sales taxes,
please visit www.fresno.ca.lp.org.

Ask county supervisors to demonstrate their support of the library by
adequately budgeting for the library with existing funds. END THE TAX NOW.
Vote NO on Measure B.

ARGUMENT AGAINST

Most of us grew up with a County Library near our homes. Their wealth of
information helped us with school projects and opened our minds to the
world with colorful books and magazines. We also remember libraries were
open long hours and there was always a friendly librarian eager to expand
our horizons with an exciting novel.

Now, thanks to years of neglect and a failure to prioritize how our tax dollars
are spent, we are subjected to few locations, and shorter hours of operation.
Some argue the internet has made libraries obsolete, however nothing can
replace the pleasure of reading a good book and over 40% of population still
lack computer access. There is no reason for this decline in service.

The real problem rests with the Board of Supervisors who have ignored the
libraries for years. They passed budgets which failed to maintain the level of
service needed to keep up with our growing community.

The time has come for the taxpayers to send a clear message to the Board.
Balance the budget with the tax dollars you are already collecting. Take
advantage of increased revenues thanks to record setting appreciation in the
assessed value of homes and businesses. Tell the Supervisors to protect
funding for the libraries instead of spending millions of dollars on wasteful
programs such as workmen’s compensation fraud and the payment of
welfare benefits to illegal aliens.

Make the Supervisors accountable to our tax dollars just as we are
responsible for our family’s budget. Giving them more money to spend is not
the answer.

Our families, seniors and small business owners are paying enough and can’t
afford more taxes. Join the Valley Taxpayers Coalition, and the Libertarian
Party of Fresno County and vote no on new taxes and no on the Library tax.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST

Measure B results speak for themselves. Even those opposing Measure B
agree on the important services library districts provide to young and old.
They admit our libraries need the funds Measure B delivers. Instead, they

direct their arguments against the Board of Supervisors. They say the Board
should find the money, despite the rapid rise in public safety demands on one
side and continuing unfunded mandates and cuts by the state on the other.

The statewide squeeze allows no fiscal help for the libraries except through
Measure B. That was true before initial passage and is even truer today—the
state just took nearly $16 million in county property tax funds.

We do not want a return to the libraries’ “bad old days” of short hours, fewer
books and other materials, and shrinking services. A “Yes” vote will not add a
new tax, merely keep funding at the current level. An oversight committee
provides local control, since all Measure B collections are spent locally.

Our school children in financially strapped districts will need public library
facilities more than ever. Keep library doors open, providing expanded
services. Vote “Yes” on Measure B.

Adoption of an Ordinance Proposing Successor Library Sales Tax

RECOMMENDED ACTION

It is recommended that your Board:

1.	Conduct the first hearing on an Ordinance amending the Ordinance Code of
the County of Fresno by re-adopting uncodified sections and by amending
sections 4.20.010 and 4.20.110 of Chapter 4.20 of Title 4 thereof, imposing a
successor countywide transactions and use tax to supplement funding for public
libraries, to be administered by the State Board of Equalization.

2.	Set second hearing for May 18, 2004.

FISCAL IMPACT

The ordinance adopted by your Board today requires voter approval of two thirds of the
voters voting on the measure. The tax would be a successor tax imposed at the rate of
one-eighth of one percent (0.125%). The estimated annual income to the Fresno
County Free Library and the Coalinga-Huron Library District is $13,100,000 depending .
on the economy and the administrative fee charged by the State Board of Equalization.
These tax revenues would be shared by the two library entities, based on a population
formula which would be adjusted once. The revenues would be received and

The cost of adding the item to the November 2, 2004 ballot, estimated by the County
Clerk to be between $60,000 and $80,000, would be a General Fund Expense.

If the voters approve the tax, the Fresno County Free Library and the Coalinga-Huron
Library District will reimburse the County for this expense. Should the measure not be
approved, the County will finance the expense from the Miscellaneous Expenditures
budget (2540), Professional and Specialized Services Account 7295.

The total for all local sales taxes, in addition to the 7.25% imposed statewide, cannot
exceed 2.0 percent. If this tax is approved by the voters, it will be a successor tax at the
same rate as the current tax and will have no impact on the lid.

DISCUSSION

1.	Adoption of Ordinance

This ordinance allows the voters to vote on a successor to Measure B, which was
approved in November 1998, and extends from April 1, 1999 to March 30, 2006.

Unlike most other statutes authorizing local sales tax proposals, Revenue and Taxation
Code section 7286.59 does not require a two-thirds majority vote by your Board to place
the ordinance on the ballot, so the ordinance may be approved by simple majority. The
Ordinance must be heard twice by your Board. The second reading will be May 18,
2004.

Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, as specifically authorized by section
7286.59 of Chapter 2.98 of Part 1.7 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code
authorizes a board of supervisors to propose a sales tax for library purposes. This tax
may be imposed at the rate of 0.125 or 0.25 percent for up to 16 years, and can be
renewed with voter approval. The tax must supplement, not supplant, current funding
for public libraries. The statute requires the tax to be in the form of a county ordinance,
which must include an expenditure plan.

The campaign committee, Citizens for Libraries and Literacy, recommended that the tax
continue exactly as the current tax, that is at 0.125 percent for 7 years.

All sales taxes in California must be administered and distributed by the State Board of
Equalization. The provisions of the ordinance are designed to meet the requirements
imposed by the State Board of Equalization and have been reviewed by the State Board
of Equalization. The ordinance also includes the specific requirement for a library sales

#18358

Board of Supervisors

Page 3

tax of an “expenditure plan describing the specific purposes for which the revenues from
the tax may be expended." (Rev. & Tax. Code Section 7286.59, subd. (a)(2).) The
proposed ordinance language includes methodology for dividing revenue between the
Fresno County Free Library and the Coalinga-Huron Library District. It also calls for
reimbursing the County for the cost of the election and for the start-up fee charged by
the State Board of Equalization. This ordinance includes a new provision which would
allow revenue from this second sales tax to be used to pay for the election for a third
sales tax measure, if one is proposed at a later date.

The tax authorized in the Ordinance would generate approximately $13,100,000 per
year initially for the entire county. The actual income would depend on the economy,
the cost of the election, and the final administrative cost deducted by the State Board of
Equalization. Using the formula in the Ordinance and the 2003 certified population,
Fresno County Library would receive 96.9% and the Coalinga-Huron Library District
3.1%.

The expenditure plan continues the services begun under the current Measure B,
continuing expanded library hours and programs for children, adults and young adults,
continuing restored literacy services, continuing to maintain, restore and construct new
libraries. The extent to which the plan will be implemented will depend on revenues
received. The attached Operational Service Delivery Plan interprets and expands on
the details of the ordinance. Adoption and implementation of the Operational Service
Delivery Plan will continue to be through your Board’s annual adoption of the Budget.

Should the measure pass, the ordinance allows the County Librarian to finalize
implementation with the State Board of Equalization.

If the ordinance is approved by your Board today and at the second reading on May 18,
2004, and if your Board approves at the May 18 meeting, by a majority vote, a
resolution placing the measure on the ballot, the sales tax will appear on the November
2, 2004 ballot. If approved by two-thirds of the voters voting on the measure, the tax
would become operative on the later of April 1, 2006 or the first day of the first calendar
quarter following the execution of the required contracts by the State Board of
Equalization.

The Citizens Review Panel established under the current Measure B Ordinance would
continue to serve.

2.	Impact on Future Sales Tax Proposals

The total for all local sales taxes, in addition to the 7.25% imposed statewide, cannot
exceed 2.0 percent. If this tax is approved by the voters, it will be a successor tax at the
same rate as the current tax and will have no impact on the lid.

OTHER REVIEWING AGENCIES

County Counsel, the County Clerk/Registrar of Voters, the Coalinga-Huron Library
District, and the Citizens for Libraries and Literacy have assisted in the preparation of
this ordinance. The Citizens Review Panel and the State Board of Equalization have
reviewed and approved the ordinance. The Citizens Review Panel approved the
Operational Service Delivery Plan.

Attachment t

Operational Service Delivery Plan
2006-2013

1.	Branch Hours of Service

Continue the total hours of all locations at 70,000 annual hours of public service.
This level is double the number of hours in 1996-97. The hours at each location
would continue, as in the past, to be based on population, use, and number of
community based activities. At this level of access, library service would
continue to accommodate multiple types of programs for children; convenient
open hours of access for all patrons; literacy activities; programs for teens,
adults, and seniors; bookmobile hours to visit senior centers and child day care
centers in the county; and activities in support of independent learning
particularly in support of job training. Workstations with World Wide Web
Access, Library Catalog and Web Access, Database Access, and office
productivity tools will be available in all locations.

At each location the specific hours open each day would be determined in
consultation with community library staff and schedules will be flexible to meet
community needs as they change.

2.	Service to Children, Teens and Seniors

Specific services in this area will continue to include in-library story hours for
preschoolers and toddlers; school age programs; visits to classrooms,
particularly annual visits to each kindergarten, fifth, sixth, seventh and ninth
grade classes; group visits from schools; coordination with teachers at all
locations; coordination of technology to improve service to children and teens;
bookmobile service to day care centers and senior centers; in-library reading
activities for teens and teen outreach activities promoting reading to community
centers; and enhanced library material collections for children, teens and seniors.
The program which delivers materials to patrons who are not able to leave their
home will be expanded under volunteer services.

3.	Literacy Services

Library based literacy services in Fresno County will continue under the
California Library Literacy Services program. The program was discontinued in
1991 due to lack of funds. Local funding enables the Library to qualify for state
monies that help support adult literacy, Families for Literacy, and the
AprendoVan mobile family literacy services. These programs will continue to add
more books to the library collection, recruit and train volunteer tutors, provide one
to one tutoring for adults in reading, writing, spelling and basic math and help
parents with low levels of literacy to nurture a love of reading and learning in their
children.

#

#18358

4.	Library Book and Materials Collections

The plan will acquire books and other materials at a level three times that of
1996-97 local funding. These new books and materials will replace current ones
that are old, worn or out-of-date. Sufficient quantities of books will be added to
keep pace with the growing population and to particularly focus on children,
teens and seniors in our service area.

5.	New and Replacement Equipment

New and replacement equipment will be purchased to house, preserve and
secure collections. Special emphasis will be placed on equipment which
improves the productivity of staff.

6.	Library Facilities Maintenance and Operations

To operate and maintain the current 34 Library buildings and three bookmobiles
at the doubled hours of operation, appropriations for services, the increase in
supplies and maintenance staff will continue. The Library owns 12 buildings;
while critical deferred maintenance issues were addressed in the first years of
Measure B, other projects loom including regular recarpeting and painting and
ADA accommodations and earthquake safety modifications. For the leased
facilities (22), rental rates have generally been so low that owners cannot make
needed improvements and still receive a positive return.

7.	New and Remodeled Libraries

Funding would be possible to begin to meet the needs identified in the Long
Term Facilities Plan adopted by your Board in February 2003. Matching local
funds will ensure that sufficient funds are available for the maximum number of
projects and to capture any state or federal funding which may become available.

requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue
and Taxation Code;

c.	To adopt a retail transactions and use tax Ordinance which
imposes a tax and provides a measure for it that the State Board of
Equalization can administer and collect in a manner that adapts itself as fully
as practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from, the existing

d.	To adopt a retail transactions and use tax Ordinance which can

consistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and
Taxation Code, will reduce the cost of collecting the transactions and use
taxes and simultaneously will reduce the burden of record keeping upon
persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this Ordinance.

e.	To adopt a retail transactions and use tax Ordinance that
provides funding for public library construction, acquisition, programs, and
operations within this County. Such revenues shall be used only to
supplement existing expenditures for public libraries and shall not be used to
supplant existing funding for the support of public libraries. For the purposes

Dear Supervisor Case:

I	understand that the Board of Supervisors will be holding the 1st Reading of the
Ordinance to place Measure B on the November ballot.

We are very short staffed and I will be unable to attend. However, I did wish to let you
know that my Board of Directors and the community at large is in support of this ballot
measure. Since it is a renewal, they do not look at it as additional taxes. We realize that
without the continuing funding of Measure B our services will immediately drop
drastically. Within a ten year period, if wc must depend on Property Taxes only, we will
have to lay off staff and we would certainly not be able to stay open as many days as we
do now.

P S. We have missed you at the Project Coalinga meetings.

SUBJECT:	Adoption of an Ordinance Proposing Successor Library Sales Tax

RECOMMENDED ACTION

It is recommended that your Board:

Conduct second, hearing on an Ordinance amending the Ordinance Code of
the County of Fresno by re-adopting uncodifled sections and by amending
sections 4.20.010 and 4.20.110 of Chapter 4.20 of Title 4 thereof, imposing a
successor countywide transactions and use tax to supplement funding for public
libraries, to be administered by the State Board of Equalization.

FISCAL IMPACT

The ordinance adopted by your Board today requires voter approval of two thirds of the
voters voting on the measure. The tax would be a successor tax imposed at the rate of
one-eighth of one percent (0.125%). The estimated annual income to the Fresno
County Free Library and the Coalinga-Huron Library District is $13,100,000 depending
on the economy and the administrative fee charged by the State Board of Equalization.
These tax revenues would be shared by the two library entities, based on a population
formula which would be adjusted once. The revenues would be received and
distributed by the County.

The cost of adding the item to the November 2, 2004 ballot, estimated by the County
Clerk to be between $60,000 and $80,000, would be a General Fund Expense.

If the voters approve the tax, the Fresno County Free Library and the Coa/inga-Huron
Library District will reimburse the County for this expense. Should the measure not be
approved, the County will finance the expense from the Miscellaneous Expenditures
budget (2540), Professional and Specialized Services Account 7295.

The total for all local sales taxes, in addition to the 7.25% imposed statewide, cannot
exceed 2.0 percent. If this tax is approved by the voters, it will be a successor tax at the
same rate as the current tax and will have no impact on the lid.

DISCUSSION

1.	Adoption of Ordinance

this ordinance allows the voters to vote on a successor to Measure B, which was
approved in November 1998, and extends from April 1, 1999 to March 30, 2006.

Unlike most other statutes authorizing local sales tax proposals, Revenue and Taxation
Code section 7286.59 does not require a two-thirds majority vote by your Board to place
the ordinance on the ballot, so the ordinance may be approved by simple majority. The
Ordinance must be heard twice by your Board. The second reading will be May 18,
2004.

Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, as specifically authorized by section
7286.59 of Chapter 2.98 of Part 1.7 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code
authorizes a board of supervisors to propose a sales tax for library purposes. This tax
may be imposed at the rate of 0.125 or 0.25 percent for up to 16 years, and can be
renewed with voter approval. The tax must supplement, not supplant, current funding
for public libraries. The statute requires the tax to be in the form of a county ordinance,
which must include an expenditure plan.

The campaign committee, Citizens for Libraries and Literacy, recommended that the tax
continue exactly as the current tax, that is at 0.125 percent for 7 years.

All sales taxes in California must be administered and distributed by the State Board of
Equalization. The provisions of the ordinance are designed to meet the requirements
imposed by the State Board of Equalization and have been reviewed by the State Board
of Equalization. The ordinance also includes the specific requirement for a library sales

tax of an “expenditure plan describing the specific purposes for which the revenues from
the tax may be expended.” (Rev. & Tax. Code Section 7286.59, subd. (a)(2).) The
proposed ordinance language includes methodology for dividing revenue between the
Fresno County Free Library and the Coalinga-Huron Library District. It also calls for
reimbursing the County for the cost of the election and for the start-up fee charged by
the State Board of Equalization. This ordinance includes a new provision which would
allow revenue from this second sales tax to be used to pay for the election for a third
sales tax measure, if one is proposed at a later date.

The tax authorized in the Ordinance would generate approximately $13,100,000 per
year initially for the entire county. The actual income would depend on the economy,
the cost of the election, and the final administrative cost deducted by the State Board of
Equalization. Using the formula in the Ordinance and the 2003 certified population,
Fresno County Library would receive 96.9% and the Coalinga-Huron Library District
3.1%.

The expenditure plan continues the services begun under the current Measure B,
continuing expanded library hours and programs for children, adults and young adults,
continuing restored literacy services, continuing to maintain, restore and construct new
libraries. The extent to which the plan will be implemented will depend on revenues
received. The attached Operational Service Delivery Plan interprets and expands on
the details of the ordinance. Adoption and implementation of the Operational Service
Delivery Plan will continue to be through your Board’s annual adoption of the Budget.

Should the measure pass, the ordinance allows the County Librarian to finalize
implementation with the State Board of Equalization.

If the ordinance is approved by your Board today and at the second reading on May 18,
2004, and if your Board approves at the May 18 meeting, by a majority vote, a
resolution placing the measure on the ballot, the sales tax will appear on the November
2, 2004 ballot. If approved by two-thirds of the voters voting on the measure, the tax
would become operative on the later of April 1,2006 or the first day of the first calendar
quarter following the execution of the required contracts by the State Board of
Equalization.

The Citizens Review Panel established under the current Measure B Ordinance would
continue to serve.

2. Impact on Future Sales Tax Proposals

The total for all local sales taxes, in addition to the 7.25% imposed statewide, cannot
exceed 2.0 percent. If this tax is approved by the voters, it will be a successor tax at 1
same rate as the current tax and will have no impact on the lid.

OTHER REVIEWING AGENCIES

County Counsel, the County Clerk/Registrar of Voters, the Coalinga-Huron Library
District, and the Citizens for Libraries and Literacy have assisted in the preparation of
this ordinance. The Citizens Review Panel and the State Board of Equalization have
reviewed and approved the ordinance. The Citizens Review Panel approved the
Operational Service Delivery Plan.

Attachment 1

Operational Service Delivery Plan
2006-2013

1.	Branch Hours of Service

Continue the total hours of all locations at 70,000 annual hours of public service. :
This level is double the number of hours in 1996-97. The hours at each location I
would continue, as in the past, to be based on population, use, and number of
community based activities. At this level of access, library service would
continue to accommodate multiple types of programs for children; convenient
open hours of access for all patrons; literacy activities; programs for teens,
adults, and seniors; bookmobile hours to visit senior centers and child day care
centers in the county; and activities in support of independent learning
particularly in support of job training. Workstations with World Wide Web
Access, Library Catalog and Web Access, Database Access, and office
productivity tools will be available in all locations.

At each location the specific hours open each day would be determined in
consultation with community library staff and schedules will be flexible to meet 1
community needs as they change.	1

i

2.	Service to Children, Teens and Seniors

Specific services in this area will continue to include in-library story hours for
preschoolers and toddlers; school age programs; visits to classrooms,
particularly annual visits to each kindergarten, fifth, sixth, seventh and ninth
grade classes; group visits from schools; coordination with teachers at all
locations; coordination of technology to improve service to children and teens;
bookmobile service to day care centers and senior centers; in-library reading
activities for teens and teen outreach activities promoting reading to community
centers; and enhanced library material collections for children, teens and seniors.
The program which delivers materials to patrons who are not able to leave their
home will be expanded under volunteer services.

3.	Literacy Services

Library based literacy services in Fresno County will continue under the
California Library Literacy Services program. The program was discontinued in
1991 due to lack of funds. Local funding enables the Library to qualify for state
monies that help support adult literacy, Families for Literacy, and the
AprendoVan mobile family literacy services. These programs will continue to add
more books to the library collection, recruit and train volunteer tutors, provide one
to one tutoring for adults in reading, writing, spelling and basic math and help
parents with low levels of literacy to nurture a love of reading and learning in their
children.

4.	Library Book and Materials Collections

The plan will acquire books and other materials at a level three times that of
1996-97 local funding. These new books and materials will replace current ones
that are old, worn or out-of-date. Sufficient quantities of books will be added to \
keep pace with the growing population and to particularly focus on children, j
teens and seniors in our service area.

5.	New and Replacement Equipment

New and replacement equipment will be purchased to house, preserve and
secure collections. Special emphasis will be placed on equipment which
improves the productivity of staff.

6.	Library Facilities Maintenance and Operations

To operate and maintain the current 34 Library buildings and three bookmobiles
at the doubled hours of operation, appropriations for services, the increase in
supplies and maintenance staff will continue. The Library owns 12 buildings;
while critical deferred maintenance issues were addressed in the first years of |
Measure B, other projects loom including regular recarpeting and painting and
ADA accommodations and earthquake safety modifications. For the leased
facilities (22), rental rates have generally been so low that owners cannot make
needed improvements and still receive a positive return.

7.	New and Remodeled Libraries

Funding would be possible to begin to meet the needs identified in the Long
Term Facilities Plan adopted by your Board in February 2003. Matching local
funds will ensure that sufficient funds are available for the maximum number of
projects and to capture any state or federal funding which may become available.

SUBJECT:	Adopt	Resolution	Placing	Proposed	Library	Sales	Tax	on	Ballot

RECOMMENDED ACTION:

It is recommended that your Board adopt a Resolution placing the proposed library sales
tax on the ballot

FISCAL IMPACT:

The ordinance adopted by your Board today requires voter approval. The cost of adding the

$80,000, would be a General Fund Expense.

If the voters approve the tax, the Fresno County Free Library and the Coalinga-Huron Library
District will reimburse the County for this expense. Should the measure not be approved, the
County will finance the expense from the Miscellaneous Expenditures budget (2540),
Professional and Specialized Services Account 7295.

DISCUSSION:

The ordinance proposing the library sales tax must be presented to the voters. Accordingly,
your Board must adopt a resolution placing the ordinance on the ballot. This resolution may be
adopted by a simple majority.

OTHER REVIEWING AGENCIES	•	'

County Counsel, the Coalinga-Huron Library District, the Citizens Review Panel, County
