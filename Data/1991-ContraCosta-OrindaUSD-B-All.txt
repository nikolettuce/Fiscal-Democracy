COUNTY COUNSEL'S ANALYSIS OF

MEASURE PROPOSING A SPECIAL TAX AND
A COUNTERPART INCREASE IN THE DISTRICT’S
APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT

The governing board of the Orinda Union School District has adopted a resolution pro-
posing h special tax and a counterpart increase in the district's appropriations limit.

The ballot measure includes the following provisions:

1.	Special Tax. The ballot measure proposes a special tax at a rate not to exceed seventy
dollars per year per parcel for three years. The proceeds of the proposed special tax will be
used: ill to maintain programs critical to the quality of the educational process: i2) to maintain
a class size that maximizes learning by the community's children: and (3i to attract and retain
qualified and experienced employees. Proceeds from the proposed special lax may be used only
for the specific purposes set forth in the ballot measure.

2.	Appropriations Limit. The ballot, measure also seeks voter approval to increase the
appropriations limit for three years in the amount of the special tax. In order to expend the
proceeds of the proposed special tax, the district must have a sufficient appropriations limit
to allow such special tax.

The ballot measure will pass or fail as a whole. Two-thirds of those voting on the measure
must approve the measure in order for it to pass.

A “yes” vote is to authorize the special tax and the appropriations limit.

A ‘'no” vote is against authorizing the special tax and the appropriations limit.

This rejection by the full Board of Trustees suggests to me. at least, that the urgent need of
additional funding is not important enough for the Board to GUARANTEE to protect our public
trust lands without DOUBLE TAXATION

Please vote NO on this single-issue tax,
William A. Gross

*	Vote NO to preserve our public trust lands,.

*	This lax proposes to collect I1.; million dollars from Grinds taxpayers but retains for the
School Board Trustees the freedom to sell Pine Grove and Wagner Ranch Schools at. any
time u> the highest, bidders, a step which would then require even more tax dollars from
the citizenry in order to maintain public ownership of any portions of the schools such as
playing fields and nature area.

*	Vote NO on this single-issue tax.

Measure R has nothing to do with public trust lands. Measure B will provide critically
needed funds Ii>r our three Orinda elementary schools and the O rind a Intermediate School.

Our stthool district in ranked among the best in the state. Despite a severe loss of revenue from
the st;W. our district hafc maintained its excellent programs. The Educational Foundation of
Orinda. as well as the Parent Clubs of each school have helped to fund core programs which
otherwise would have been reduced or eliminated.

This year our school district will receive over $1,000,000 less than is needed U> maintain
programs at their current level. Measure R will provide temporary additional funds for three
years to benefit our local schools. Funds will be used to;

U Maintain class size at current levels.

2 Maintain the current school day uh> reduction in instructional hours;.

T Avoid reductions in mathematics, science, language arts, and social sciences.

4. Provide for continuation of existing courses in music, computer instruction, and physical
education.

o. Purchase of up-to-date classroom textbooks and library materials.

All funds generated by Measure B will he used in Orinda and will benefit only Orinda children
and community.

Please Vote Yes on Measure B.
