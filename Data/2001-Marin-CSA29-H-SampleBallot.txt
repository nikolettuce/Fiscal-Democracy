ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE H

Approval of Measure H renews the County Service Area
No. 29 parcel tax, beginning in fiscal year 2002/03, which will
continue the source of funding to pay for on-going maintenance
dredging of the waterways and entrances of Paradise Cay for
another ten years.

No other water oriented community in Marin County has
the enviable record for the frequency and cost effectiveness of
dredging as County Service Area No. 29. Since 1992, three
dredging episodes totaling $386,300 have been completed. A
fourth project, estimated at $200,000, is planned for the Fall
of 2002 and will be the last dredging episode to be funded by
the current annual parcel tax of $300 per riparian lot, approved
by County Service Area No. 29 voters in April 1992.

The County Service Area No. 29 Advisory Board has
projected future dredging requirements for the next ten years,
beginning in fiscal year 2002/03. The estimated cost is
approximately $1,257,000, based upon the cost experience of
prior dredging projects, adjusted for inflation. It should be no
surprise that dredging costs have increased significantly in
recent years due to higher labor and fuel costs as well as
lengthy and costly regulatory and testing requirements.

After reviewing the projections of costs and funding, the
Advisory Board recommended that the new parcel tax be set
at $925 per riparian lot to enable County Service Area No. 29
to undertake and complete a new ten year dredging program.

Maintaining our waterways is vital in protecting property
values and also ensuring that Paradise Cay continues to be a
highly desirable community in which to live.

The County Service Area No. 29 Advisory Board composed
of Harry Blake, Bill Canada, Bill Tapscott, Herm Zelles and I
urge you to VOTE “YES" on Measure “H” and the companion
Measure “I”.
