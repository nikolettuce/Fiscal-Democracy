THE FRESNO COUNTY MEASURE “C”

EXTENSION EXPENDITURE PLAN
FULL TEXT OF MEASURE

INTRODUCTION

The Fresno County Measure “C” Extension Expenditure Plan was prepared to guide
the expenditure of more than $1.7 billion in transportation funds generated through
continuation of Fresno County's half-cent transportation sales tax over the next 20
years, if approved by voters in the November 2006 election,

Fresno County’s current Measure “C” Program, voter approved in 1986, expires in
June 2007. This new Expenditure Plan, developed by a Steering Committee
representing diverse community interests, will address major regional transportation
needs in Fresno County through the year 2027. The Steering Committee thoroughly
considered needs identified by. voters and community residents during development
of the Plan. To insure the Plan addressed transportation needs of all County residents,
the Steering Committee;

•	Adhered to requirements contained in the Measure “C” Extension enabling
legislation

•	Reviewed Measure programs recently passed in other counties (best
practices review)

•	Listened to presentations by air quality and transportation advocates and
regulators

•	Just under 35% of the funds are directed to local street and highway
maintenance, ADA improvements, pedestrian, trail, and bicycle facilities
improvements, and as “flexible” funding to each of the cities and Fresno
County so that they can address their own individual transportation needs
over the 20-year period

•	Roughly 30% of the Measure funding is directed to capacity enhancing street
and highway improvements in the Urban (Clovis and Fresno Spheres of
Influence) and Rural (remaining County and rural cities) areas

•	6% of the funds are available to achieve Rail Consolidation within the Fresno
urban area, although if rail consolidation is not able to be achieved within 15
years the funds revert to grade separation that are to be coordinated with
transit improvements to achieve air quality and congestion relief benefits

•	The remaining Measure “C” funds are programmed for other transportation
modes and programs such as transit oriented development, school bus
replacement, and program administration and planning activities

2006 MEASURE “C” EXTENSION PLAN
EXPENDITURES TO TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS

•	Local Transportation Program - 34.6% ($593.6 million)

•	Regional Transportation Program - 30.4% ($520.8 million)

•	Regional Public Transit Program - 24% ($412.1 million)

•	Alternative Transportation Program - 6% ($102.5 million)

•	Environmental Enhancement Program - 3.5% ($59.8 million)

• Administration/Planning Program -1.5% ($25.6 million)

RESPONDING TO CORE VALUES

Two-thirds (67%) voter approval is necessary to pass Measure “C” in November 2006.
In order to ensure that Steering Committee members were on target with this
Expenditure Plan, voters and community residents were initially surveyed to determine
support for extension of the Measure. Voters were surveyed again to confirm support
for proposed expenditures.

The latest voter poll results indicate Measure “C” has a broad base of support 170% of
the likely voters) because the transportation programs contained in the Measure
reflect “core values” identified through the surveys such as:

•	Maintaining a vibrant economy

•	Cleaning our air

•	Local control of Measure “C” Extension funds

•	Leveraging matching funds from federal and state sources

•	Having a Measure “C” Citizen Oversight Committee

•	Heard innovative ideas related to new technologies in transportation and land
use advances

OVERVIEW-THE MEASURE KC" EXTENSION PROGRAM

The percentages below provide an overview of the proposed Measure “C” Extension
Plan funding expenditures approved by the Steering Committee. Referencing the
percentages, the allocations consider a “multi-modal” transportation program with:

•	Almost 25% of the expected Measure funds are directed to public transit
services and other transit-related activities and programs

Meeting the needs of Fresno County residents requires leveraging state and federal
investments with local resources. Even with a Measure “C” extension there will not be
enough funding available to address the more than $7.5 billion in transportation
needs. The Measure “C” Extension will generate slightly more than $1.7 billion over
the next 20 years to address a portion of the need. Therefore leveraging additional
federal and state dollars, beyond what the region expects, is critical.

SUCCESS OF THE CURRENT MEASURE “C” PROGRAM

Many changes to the existing transportation system have occurred since voters first
approved Measure “C” in 1986. New and improved regional and local stmo*- —1

R-9020-1

highways have been or will be constructed improving travel flow and reducing severe
congestion. These improvements include:

•	New freeways in the Fresno-Clovis Urban Area such as State Routes (SR) 41
South, 168 and 180

•	New SR 41 expressway south to the Kings County line

•	Adding lanes to Herndon and Academy Avenues

•	Extension of Willow and Manning Avenues

•	Interchange improvements along SR 99

•	Funding for the maintenance and operation of existing public transportation
systems

•	Funding for public transit services including Fresno Area Express (FAX),
Clovis Transit, and the City of Kerman

•	Improvements to local streets and roads, bikeway and trails systems, and
pedestrian facilities

The current Measure “C” program is widely viewed as one of the most important
programs ever approved by voters in Fresno County because it provided the
opportunity to compete successfully for additional state and federal transportation
funding. The Fresno County Transportation Authority (Authority) and the Council of
Fresno County Governments (Fresno COG) worked diligently to leverage additional
dollars from Sacramento and Washington D.C. for every Measure “C” dollar generated
locally under the current Measure “C* program. Responsibilities of the Authority and
Fresno COG are provided in Appendix A. Extending Measure “C” will continue to
provide local funds under local control, in order to leverage and direct additional state
and federal funding to the County.

ANNUAL AUDIT OF MEASURE PROGRAMS

Current Measure “C” expenditures and accounts of the local agencies and the
Authority are audited on an annual basis by an independent audit firm retained by the
Authority. Over the past 18 years, audit results have indicated that the Measure “C”
Program has been implemented, and proceeds expended, in accordance with the
Measure “C” Expenditure Plan and enabling legislation. That practice will continue
with this Measure “C” Extension Program. Appendix A also provides additional detail
regarding the Measure “C” Extension audit process.

HOW THE PLAN WAS DEVELOPED

The Measure “C” Extension Steering Committee was formed in May 2005 to develop
the Measure “C” Extension Plan. The Steering Committee evaluated existing systems
and created a vision for the future. There was recognition that this Measure “C”
Extension Plan needed to aid Fresno County in its transition from a county with a
population of approximately 900,000 in 2006, to a county with over 1.3 million by 2027.
This Plan recognizes transportation programs that maintain and improve our quality of
life and yet positions us to deal with the type of infrastructure that will be needed to
address the higher population and its mobility needs. Members of the Steering
Committee reviewed a variety of proposals, solicited public input and
professional expertise, conducted two polls, and reviewed data and literature
from other agencies to prepare this Plan.

Members of the Steering Committee represented the interests of:

•	Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)/Seniors

•	Agriculture

•	Building Industry Association

•	Business - Chamber of Commerce

•	Cities of Clovis and Fresno

•	Coalition for Livable Communities

•	County of Fresno

•	Eastside Fresno County Cities

•	Environmental Justice Task Force

•	Faith Based Organizations

•	Fresno Area Residents for Rail Consolidation

•	Fresno Business Council

•	Fresno County Transportation Authority

•	Labor

•	League of Women Voters of Fresno

•	Medical

•	Sierra Club-Tehipite Chapter

•	Southwest Transportation Agency

•	Taxpayers Association

•	Trails/Education

•	Trucking

•	Westside Fresno County Cities
EXPECTED MEASURE “C” PROCEEDS

If voters approve the extension of Measure “C” on November 7, 2006, they allow the
Authority to continue to impose a Vz% retail transaction and use tax for 20 years
(between July 1,2007 and June 30, 2027). The Measure “C” Extension Sales Tax will
provide $1.7 billion in new revenues for transportation improvements according
to financial projections through the year 2027.

This estimate considers current sales tax receipts and a conservative five percent (5%)
growth rate in sales tax proceeds through June 2027. The Measure Extension will
generate more than double the amount that will be collected during the current
Measure “C” Program ($686.3 million) through June 2007. The allocation of these
projected sales tax revenues to specific types of transportation funding programs and
improvement projects is described in the following sections of this Plan. The
Expenditure Plan will be updated every two (2) years to adjust the projection of sales
tax receipts, making sure that the projections are consistent with future expenditures
and promises made in this initial Plan. The Authority will have the option of issuing
bonds to deliver Measure “C” projects and programs contained in this Expenditure
Plan to save project costs by delivering them earlier.

REGiONAL PRIORITIES OF THE NEW PLAN

Through many months of intense discussion and hard work, the following Measure
“C” Extension funding program commitments were developed and agreed to by the
Steering Committee. The Committee realized that providing Measure “C” funds for all
modes of transportation would meet the quality of life intent of the “New” Measure “C”.
This would in turn enable agencies within the County to address the needs of
residents, businesses, and major industries over the 20-year life of the Measure. The
new Plan will provide a balance between public transit, road improvements, and other
transportation programs that improve mobility and air quality within the County and
each of the cities.

FR 188-011

Plan expenditure programs are detailed in Table 1. Implementing Guidelines for each
of the six (6) expenditure programs described below are contained in Appendices B
through G.

1.	REGIONAL PUBLIC TRANSIT-$412.1 MILLION OR 24%

The goal is to expand mass transit programs that have a demonstrated ability to get
people out of their cars and improve air quality. To accomplish this important goal:

t $337.1 million (approximately 20%) is provided to the three (3) transit
agencies within the County (Fresno Area Express, Clovis Transit, and the
Fresno County Rural Transit Agency)

•	The transit agencies would use the funds to address major new expansions
of the express, local and feeder bus services including additional:

Routes

Buses (including low emission)

Night and weekend service
Bus shelters

Safer access to public transit services

•	The transit agencies would also apply the Measure funds to provide:

“Free bus service” to seniors 65 and older

"Subsidized taxi script” to seniors (70 years or older) resulting in
better service to people with special transportation needs and the
growing aging population in Fresno County

•	Another $75 million (over 4%) is provided to:

Improve mobility for seniors and people with disabilities

Get farmworkers and commuters to their destinations safely,
improve air quality, provide a cost-effective alternative to the single
occupant vehicle, and address the social needs of the community
through the Farmworker Van Pool program

Set-aside funds for new transit technologies such as Personal Rapid
Transit (PRT) or a similar system

Fund Phase II of the Public Transportation Infrastructure Study
(PTIS), which will look to the future and identify how Fresno County
residents can take advantage of new technologies and advances in
public transit and land use planning

Finance a study to guide potential implementation of consolidated
transit services within the County

Specific Public Transit Program highlights and implementing guidelines are described
in Appendix B.

2.	LOCAL TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM - $593.6 MILLION OR 34.6%.

The goal is to improve each individual city’s and the County’s local transportation
systems. Several funding programs are included:

•	Approximately $263 million (more than 15%) has been guaranteed to the
County and every city to:

________________ Fill	potholes	___________________________________________

Repave streets
Improve sidewalks

Upgrade the local transportation infrastructure

These expenditures would address one of the most troubling transportation problems
for local agencies, which is how to fund improvements that address the aging street
and road infrastructure.

•	Approximately $253 million (almost 15%) of “flexible” funding is provided to
the local agencies for any transportation project they feel is warranted
(example: transit, pothole repair, match for new federal or state programs),
the local agencies in Fresno County know what their needs are and how
best to address those needs

•	Just over $9 million (.5%) is provided to local agencies for ADA compliance
including curb cuts and ramps to remove barriers, as well as other special
transportation services

•	Approximately $68 million (4%) is provided to fund significant improvements
to the existing and planned pedestrian, trail, and bicycle systems. This will
minimize traffic disruption and maximize safety for trail users, cyclists and
pedestrians

Specific Local Transportation Program highlights and implementing guidelines are
described in Appendix C,

3.	REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM - $520.8 MILLION OR 30.4%.

The Plan authorizes major new projects to:

•	Improve freeway interchanges

•	Add additional lanes

•	Increase safety

•	Improve major commute corridors

These projects provide for the movement of goods, services, and people throughout
the County. Major highlights of this Program include the following:

•	Approximately $504 million (over 29%) for regionally significant street and
Highway improvements has been divided equally between the Urban and
Rural areas of the County with $252 million, or just under 15%, to each area

•	More than $17 million (1%) will be invested in improvements to Fresno
Yosemite International (FYI) and Fresno Chandler Airports. The proposed list
of FYI and Fresno Chandler Airport improvement projects using Measure “C”
Extension funding is provided in Appendix D

This funding program requires new growth and development within the County and
each of the cities to contribute to regional street and highway project costs through
establishment of the Regional Transportation Mitigation Fee (RTMF) program. Funds
collected through the RTMF program will provide an anticipated 20% of Urban and
Rural Measure “C” funds needed to deliver Tier 1 Projects over the Measure “C”
funding period (2007 through 2027). Specific Regional Transportation Program
highlights and implementing guidelines are also described in Appendix D.

4.	ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION - $102.5 MILLION OR 6%.

The funding for this program would be reserved to provide local matching funds for
the consolidation of rail lines through Fresno. Specifically, consolidation of the tracks
will:

FR 188-012

•	Increase safety (example: reduce response times for emergency vehicles,
improve the safety of school routes and crossings)

•	Reduce traffic congestion by moving the Burlington Northern Santa Fe
(BNSF) Railroad tracks adjacent to the Union Pacific (UP) Railroad tracks
through Fresno

•	Provide for new under- or over-passes that separate vehicular and rail traffic

•	Fund efforts to secure an additional $600 to $900 million of needed funding
from state, federal, or other agencies to fully fund rail consolidation

Specific Alternative Transportation Program highlights and implementing guidelines
are described in Appendix E.

5.	ENVIRONMENTAL ENHANCEMENT - $59.8 MILLION OR 3.5%.

This program’s goal is to improve air quality and the environment through two (2)
important programs:

•	Transit Oriented Infrastructure for In-Fill Development (TOD) refers to
transportation facilities in new or revitalized developments that support
increased demand for transit with higher density and mixed land use. This
type of development reduces our dependence on the automobile by
providing funding incentives for more public or alternative transportation.
Approximately $20 million (just over 1%) is dedicated to this program

•	The School Bus Replacement Program will replace the oldest school buses
in the fleet that emit toxic fumes and emissions. Approximately 900 buses
need to be replaced. All replaced buses will also be equipped with seat belts.
Other funds in addition to Measure “C” funds will be leveraged to address the
need. The result will be cleaner fueled and safer buses for our school age
children and, as all school buses will be new, there will be seatbelts for
children providing added safety benefits. Approximately $40 million (over
2%) is provided to this program

Specific Environmental Enhancement Program highlights and implementing
guidelines are described in Appendix F.

6.	ADMINISTRATION/PLANNING - $25.6 MILLION OR 1.5%.

Measure “C” funding is provided to the Authority and Fresno COQ to:

•	Prepare Expenditure Plan updates

•	Develop allocation program requirements

•	Administer and conduct specified activities identified in the other five (5)
programs described above

Specific Administration/Planning Program highlights and implementing guidelines are
described in Appendix A.

ALLOCATION OF MEASURE “C” FUNDS TO URBAN AND RURAL AREAS

Referencing Table 1, an estimated 67.5% of the Measure “C” proceeds will be spent in
the Urban Area of the County or within the Clovis and Fresno Spheres of Influence.
The remaining 32.5% will be allocated to the Rural Area or the remaining County area
including the rural cities. These estimated percentages are consistent with the
percentage of Fresno County population within the Urban Area (71%) and Rural Area
(29%). The Measure “C” Program provides funding where the multimodal
transportation needs exist, recognizing the difference between urban and rural needs,
yet reflecting the distribution of population.

PROJECT COMMITMENTS - REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM
URBAN AND RURAL PROGRAMS

This section identifies priority regional street and highway improvement projects to be
implemented over the life of the Measure “C” program or by the year 2027. The
projects would be funded with Measure “C” and/or other transportation funding.

The Countv and each of the Cities, working cooperatively with Caltrans and Fresno
COG, have identified projects that support funding commitments between 2007 and
2027. These projects were identified bv stakeholders, citizens and community groups.

Tier 1 projects to be addressed in this Program are included in Tables 2 and 3. These
projects will be funded using:

•	Measure “C” funding (approximately $504 million)

•	75%	of	the	State	Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) funding

expected over the 20-year Measure and other local, state or federal funding
apportionments (or $400 million)

•	Approximately $102 million from developer fees. New growth and
development throughout the County would be required to contribute to Tier 1
project costs as part of the Regional Transportation Mitigation Fee (RTMF)
program. Details regarding the RTMF are provided in Appendix D

These funding sources together, result in slightly more than $1 billion available for
Tier 1 Urban and Rural regional street and highway projects. Additional projects in the
Urban and Rural Areas are included in Tier 2 tables (Tables 4 and 5). Tier 2 projects
are considered for funding once Tier 1 projects have been programmed or

implemented and if additional funding is still available over the 20-year period. Tier 1
and Tier 2 projects are in generalized priority order. During preparation of the biennial
Expenditure Plan Updates, Fresno COG will develop a detailed improvement program
that specifies the timing and delivery of projects or funding order considering project
cost benefit, project readiness, funding availability, etc. A description of funding
commitments ana implementing guidelines for the Regional Transportation Program
are provided in Appendix D.

FRESNO: AIRPORTS PROGRAM

Another component of the Regional Transportation Program is the Fresno Airports
Program. Measure “C” Funds will be available to match state and federal funding for
improvements at FYI and at the Fresno Chandler Downtown Executive Airport. A list of
these projects is provided in Appendix D. The most significant capacity enhancing
projects shown in the list of FYI improvement projects include the following Tier 1 and
Tier 2 projects:

•	Tier 1

Rehabilitate Taxiway C and Hold Pad - $27.1 million
($1.4 million Measure “C”)

Rehabilitate and Extend Runway 11R-29L - $45.0 million
($2.3 million Measure “C”)

Rehabilitate Taxi way B and Install all SMGCS lighting improvements.
This will better address our foggy day departures and prevent many
delays - $5.3 million
($.4 million Measure “C”)

Rehabilitate Taxiway CIO and Associated Aprons - $4.4 million ($.4
million Measure “C”)

Air Cargo Expansion Phase 2 - $25.1 million

($29.7 million Measure “C”)

Part 150 Noise Mitigation Program - $8.0 million ($.8 million Measure
“C”)

Tier 2 airport projects are considered for funding once Tier 1 projects have been
programmed or implemented and if additional funding is still available over the 20-year
period.

PROJECT COMMITMENTS - OTHER PROGRAMS

In addition to the Regional Transportation Program projects, Measure “C” will provide
additional funding for a wide range of multi-modal transportation projects. Many of
these projects will be identified and implemented by the local agencies to address
specific needs or will be developed in accordance with implementing guidelines
included in Appendices C and D. Examples of this process include projects to be
funded under the Local Transportation Program and the Regional Public Transit
Program. Other funding programs have been designed to address specific types of
improvements such as the School Bus Replacement Program, the Transit Oriented
Infrastructure for In-Fill Development (TOD) Program, and the Rail Consolidation
Program. Implementing guidelines for these programs are included in Appendices E
and F.

APPENDIX A - PLAN ADMINISTRATION

GOVERNING BOARD AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE

A description of the Fresno County Transportation Authority and its organizational
structure follows. The structure is consistent with the enabling legislation.

FRESNO COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY STRUCTURE UNDER
THE MEASURE “C” EXTENSION PROGRAM

The Authority will continue to administer the Measure “C” Extension Program in
compliance with its special enabling legislation. If the Measure “C” Extension is
approved by Fresno County voters in November 2006, the Authority will continue to be
responsible for administering the Measure “C” Programs in accordance with plans
and programs outlined in this and subsequent updates of this Plan. In addition, the
enabling legislation includes provision for a Citizen Oversight Committee. Details
regarding the Committee are contained in Appendix G. The Expenditure Plan will
continue to be prepared by Fresno COG and approved by its Policy Board and by the
Authority.

The new legislation changes the manner of appointment and expands by two the
number of members on the Authority Board. The new Authority will be represented by
nine (9) members including:

•	Two (2) members of the board of supervisors appointed by the board,
consisting of one (1) member from Rural district 1, 4, or 5 and one (1)
member from Urban district 2 or 3

•	Two (2) members representing the City of Fresno, consisting of the mayor
thereof and a member of the city council of that city appointed by the city
council

•	One (1) member representing the City of Clovis appointed by the city council
of that city

•	Two (2) members representing the other cities within the county, consisting
of one (1) Westside member appointed by a committee comprised of the
mayor of each of those cities west of State Highway Route 99, and one (1)
Eastside member appointed by a committee comprised of the mayors of
each of those cities east of State Highway Route 99

•	Two (2) members Of the public at large, consisting of one member appointed
by the board of supervisors with the appointee residing outside of the
incorporated areas of Fresno and Clovis, and one member appointed jointly
by the city councils of Fresno and Clovis with the appointee residing within
the incorporated area of Fresno or Clovis

As with the current Measure “C” Program, the goal of the Authority and Fresno COG
will be to continue to fulfill the Promise of Measure “C” by delivering projects.

PLAN UPDATE AND APPROVAL PROCESS

In compliance with schedules mandated in federal and state law, Fresno COG
regularly prepares a new long-range transportation plan that updates and renews a list
of candidate projects for all transportation modes (streets, highways, public
transportation, bikeways, aviation, etc.). If funds are available for any projects beyond
those now listed in this Expenditure Plan or Appendices, they will be drawn from that
list. As stated before, all updates of the Expenditure Plan will be subject to public
review and public hearings. While these candidate projects may change and priorities
for funding may occur, there are more than enough project needs within the County to
be addressed using all types of funding, including Measure “C”. It will be vital during
development of each Expenditure Plan Update to consider financing all transportation
modes in order to insure a balanced and efficient transportation system. All of the
projects and programs included in this Expenditure Plan are considered essential to
meet the transportation needs of Fresno County.

Council of Fresno County Governments (Fresno COG)

The following steps will be taken by Fresno COG to prepare and adopt this and future
biennial updates of the Measure “C" Extension Expenditure Plan:

•	Fresno COG staff working with member agencies and affected stakeholders
develops the Draft Expenditure Plan, and will update it every two years

•	The Fresno COG Policy Board receives the Draft Expenditure Plan and its
updates and schedules public hearings to review the Plan

•	The Fresno COG Policy Board adopts the Expenditure Plan

•	The Expenditure Plan is transmitted to the Authority

FR 188-019

ADA/SENIORS/PARATRANSIT

Dedicated funding would be available for ADA and Senior/Paratransit services under
the Regional PuMc Transit Prograrn and could be used as matching funds for state or
federal funds or to augment funding under the Public Transit Agencies Program or
programs contained in the Local Transportation Program. Details regarding the
funding process and implementing guidelines will be further defined by Fresno COG
and considered for approval by the Authority.

VAN POOL PROGRAMS

Public/Private Competition

Measure “G” funds can subsidize van pool programs within Fresno County. The
programs would be evaluated for funding allocation based upon an open competitive
process. The Van Pool Program should provide an equal opportunity for both public
and private industry competition, as well as potential public/private partnerships.
Details regarding the funding process and implementing guidelines will be further
defined by Fresno COG and considered for approval by the Authority.

Commuter Van Pool Performance Criteria

•	The Fresno County Transportation Authority will issue a Request for
Proposals to qualified entities to provide such a service

•	All commuter vanpools using Measure “C" funds allocated for this purpose
must originate within Fresno County. This does not preclude an agency to
use other Measure “C” funds (e.g., Regional Public Transit, Local
Transportation Program) to subsidize additional Commuter Vanpools

•	Allocations of Measure “C” funds for vanpools will be prioritized based on
overall cost effectiveness and air quality benefit

FARMWORKER VAN POOLS

Dedicated Revenue Stream for Farmworker Vanpools

Each of the two sub-programs (Car & Van Pool and Farmworker Van Pool) should
receive equal Measure “C” funding. In addition, the Farmworker Van Pool Program is
required to operate in accordance with federal regulations and Measure “C” funding
for Farmworker Van Pool Programs within Fresno County is to be allocated to entities
through an open competitive process. Details regarding the funding process and
implementing guidelines will be further defined by Fresno COG and considered for
approval by the Authority.

Farmworker Van Pool Performance Criteria

•	The Fresno County Transportation Authority will issue a Request for
Proposals to qualified entities to provide such a service

•	The RFP will include specific performance criteria and specific operating
standards needed to operate such a service in the State of California

•	All farmworker vanpools using Measure “C” funds allocated for this purpose
must originate within Fresno County. This does not preclude an agency to
use other Measure “C” funds (e.g., Regional Public Transit, Local
Transportation Program) to subsidize additional Farmworker Vanpools

•	Allocations of Measure “C” funds for vanpools will be prioritized based on
overall cost effectiveness and air quality benefit

ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGIES

A portion of this funding allocation can be programmed and available for efforts
needed to Implement the new technologies. Also, the sub-category should be
renamed to New Technology Reserve, and defined as a funding program for new
transit technologies such as Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) or similar system, A further
recommendation was that if the sub-category does not resonate with the voters in the
follow-up poll it could be eliminated. It can also be eliminated if during the biennial
Expenditure Plan update a detailed evaluation of the feasibility and likelihood of
implementing such a system after ten (10) years is not eminent, or if construction is
not eminent within 15 years after the Measure passes. The funds would then revert
back to the Expenditure Plan update process to be allocated where the greatest need
then exists. Details regarding the funding process and implementing guidelines will
be further defined by Fresno COG and considered for approval by the Authority.

APPENDIX C - IMPLEMENTING GUIDELINES:

LOCAL TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM

LOCAL ALLOCATION PROGRAM

The Local Allocation Program consists of three (3) subprograms including the:

•	Street Maintenance/Rehabilitation

•	ADA Compliance

•	Flexible Funding

Overarching Implementation Guidelines affecting the Local Allocation Program
include:

•	A minimum base of $100,000 per year shall be allocated to each agency, and
then the annual 75% population/25% road mile formula would be applied to
determine the total funding allocation by local agency under this Program

•	The County of Fresno is annually required to spend a portion of its local
allocation in the unincorporated urban area using the 75% population/25%
road mile formula in appropriate proportion to its total allocation

Street Maintenance/Rehabilitation

The following Implementing Guidelines apply to the Street Maintenance Program:

•	A mandated 50% of the local transportation fund allocation will be earmarked
for street maintenance/rehabilitation

•	Every 5 years (4 times in 20 years) there will be a compliance test where
jurisdictions must: show they have spent their mandate, but the time frame
allows funds to accumulate up to a 5 year segment if needed for match
purposes or a large project; then they must meet the spending goals

•	If an agency is not in compliance with the 5 year mandate, funds may be
withheld until the jyrisdi.ctioh is compliant and further may be subject to an
Expenditure Plan amendment reallocating the funds upon consideration and
approval of the Fresno COG Board and Transportation Authority and when
consistent with the enabling legislation process for amendment

The following paragraph is the recommended definition of “street and highway
maintenance, rehabilitation, reconstruction, and storm damage repair.”

Definition: As per AB 2928 (Proposition 42) language for local agency allocations
(Revenue & taxation code, Section 7104 (e))

Funds allocated to a city, county.. shall be used only for street and highway

maintenance, rehabilitation, reconstruction, and storm damage repair. For purposes
of this section, the following terms have the following meanings:

Eligible Projects & Urban/Rural Allocation

FR 188-022

•	“maintenance” means either or both of the following:

-patching

-overlay and sealing

•	“reconstruction” includes any overlay, sealing; of widening of the roadway, if
the widening is necessary to bring the roadway width to the desirable
minimum width consistent with the geometric design criteria of the
department for 3-R (reconstruction, resurfacing, and rehabilitation) projects
that are not on a freeway but does not include widening for the purpose of
increasing the traffic capacity of a street or highway

•	“storm damage repair” is repair or reconstruction of local streets and
highways and related drainage improvements that have been damaged due
to winter storms and flooding, and reconstruction of drainage improvements
to mitigate future roadway flooding and damage problems, in those
jurisdictions that have been declared disaster areas by the President of the
United States

ADA Compliance

•	After the mandated 50% street maintenance/rehabilitation is subtracted, there is
an additional 1.75% mandate from the local allocation for jurisdictions to meet the
current requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Communities
already in compliance would not have to meet

•	Jurisdictions that receive less than $200,000 annually from the total local
transportation program (total funds available) would also be exempt from this
provision

•	Every 5 years (4 times in 20 years) there will be a compliance test where
jurisdictions must show they have spent their mandate, but the time frame allows
funds to accumulate up to a 5 year segment if needed for match purposes or a
large project; then they must meet the spending goals

•	Details regarding the funding process and implementing guidelines will be further
defined by Fresno COG and considered for approval by the Authority

Flexible Program

Details regarding the funding process and implementing guidelines will be defined by

Fresno COG and considered for approval by the Authority.

PEDESTRIAN/TRAILS/BICYCLE FACILITIES PROGRAM

The following implementing guidelines were prepared after lengthy discussion and

deliberation. As a result, the implementing guidelines have been inserted as approved

by the Measure “C” Steering Committee.

Master Plan for Trail. Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities

•	By January 1, 2012, all jurisdictions within Fresno County will have updated
and/or adopted a Master Plan for Trail, Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities that
promotes connectivity within all of Fresno County and its urban areas

•	Measure “C” funds may be used to pay for development of a Master Plan

•	The Master Plan will be the guiding document for upgrade and/or installation
of such facilities

•	if any jurisdiction fails to meet this goal the earmarked funds for Trail, Bicycle
and Pedestrian facilities shall be withheld by the Authority until such time as a
jurisdiction is in compliance

Pedestrian/Bicvcle Trails and Bike Lane Earmark Thresholds

•	Less than 25,000 population - jurisdictions are exempt from the earmarked
funds for pedestrian/bicycle trails and earmarked funds for bicycle facilities

•	25,000	-	74,999	population	-	jurisdictions may combine the earmarked funds

for pedestrian/bicycle trails and the earmarked funds for bicycle facilities in
order to provide flexibility in implementing projects conforming to any of the
provided definitions

•	Greater than 75,000 population - jurisdictions must meet each of the earmark
targets for 1) Pedestrian/Bicycle Trails and 2) Bicycle Facilities

Allowed Accumulation of Earmark Funds Over Five (5) Years

•	Every 5 years (4 times in 20 years) there will be a compliance test where
jurisdictions must certify to the Authority that they have spent their earmark
funds, but the time frame allows funds to accumulate up to a 5 year segment
if needed for match purposes or a large project-then the spending goals
must be met thereafter

Earmarks for Pedestrian/Bicvcle Trails

•	These funds may be used for new construction of ' pedestrian/bicycle trails
and for the development of the Master Plan as well as retrofitting
pedestrian/bicycle trails within the circulation system that existed as of
January 2007 or the date of adoption of the Master Plan

•	Trails built with earmarked or other Measure “C” funds shall, at a minimum,
be designed in accordance with the design criteria for bicycle paths and
multi-purpose trails set forth in the California Highway Design Manual,
Chapter 1000, Bikeway Planning and Design, with the following caveats:

Within the Fresno Clovis Metropolitan Area; trails built with Measure “C”
funds shall be 12 feet minimum where physically feasible

Within the Fresno Clovis Metropolitan Area, trails built with Measure “C”
funds shall be built so that at-grade crossings are limited to one every
half-mile at signalized intersections for new developments provided that
this does not violate property owner rights

Trails built within existing neighborhoods shall be built so that mid-street
crossings on collectors, arterials, super-arterials or expressways should
be either (a) controlled by an at-grade pedestrian waiting mechanism,
signalized or otherwise flashing crossing or alternative warning devices,
or (b) built with a grade separated crossing when these are warranted
due to pedestrian/bicycle safety risk areas

Where a Class 1 trail crosses a street or expressway at grade, or for connectivity
purposes, is established on a street, expressway or freeway as a Class II or Class III
facility, signing and striping shall be in accordance with the nationwide standards
established within the current edition of the MUTCD (Part 9) and/or current edition of
the California Supplement to the MUTCD (Part 9).

Jurisdictions shall certify to the Authority that these guidelines have been met in the
utilization of Measure “C” funds.

Earmarks for Bicycle Facilities

These funds may be used only for retrofitting bicycle lanes within the circulation
system that existed as of January 2007 or the date of adoption of the Master Plan.
Bicycle lanes must be consistent with the adopted Master Plan for each jurisdiction.

FR 188-023

Requirements Applying to All Facilities Utilizing Either Regional or Local

Allocation Funds

•	New Pedestrian Facilities:	Every highway, expressway, super-arterial,

arterial or collector (exempting freeway) within the urbanized areas
throughout the County that is constructed or reconstructed in whole or in part
with Measure C funds shali include sidewalks, paths, walkways, or equivalent
facilities on both sides of the street, road, or highway for use by pedestrians.
Facilities built and maintained by the State of California and projects, which
are either for routine maintenance or traffic safety purposes, are exempt from
this requirement Expressways constructed in an urban area can meet this
requirement by including a sidewalk, paths, walkways or equivalent facility on
one side of the roadway

•	New Bicycle Facilities: Every highway, expressway, super-arterial, arterial
or coliector within the County constructed or reconstructed in whole or in part
with Measure “C” funds shall include accommodations for bicycle travel
either by a shared roadway or by bike lane. A shared roadway includes a
paved shoulder or a wide outside lane. On a city or county street, road or
highway, or upon a State highway that is classified as freeway or urban area
expressway and mot already expressly closed by order, ordinance or
resolution to bicycle or pedestrian use under Section 21960 of the California
Vehicle Code, the accommodation shall be by paved shoulder or Class 1
separated bicycle path and appropriate MUTCD signing and striping.
Similarly, in the future, and consistent with the provisions of Section 888 of
the Streets and Highway Code, Caltrans shali not sever or destroy an existing
or proposed major bicycle route included in an adopted bicycle pfan unless it
provides a reasonable, safe, and convenient alternate route or such a route
exists. Identical provisions also apply to ail local agencies within the County.
While not mandatory, but where circumstances require the closure of an
existing bike facility, the intent is to provide an alternate bicycle route within 'A
mile or less of the severed route

•	Maintained Pedestrian or Bicycle Facilities: Any maintenance to a street,
road, or highway funded in whole or in part by Measure “C” funds shall, at a
minimum, maintain the existing level of pedestrian and bicycle access,
facilities and safety features along and across the street, road, or highway

•	Exceptions to the Requirements: The above requirements shall not apply if
the constructing agency, after a properly noticed public hearing, determines
that one or more of the exceptions listed below exists. The public hearing
notice shall include a statement clearly declaring that the purpose of the
hearing is to review bicycle and pedestrian facility exception (s) for the
proposed project using Measure “C” funds and identifying the specific
exceptions. The exceptions are:

The provision of pedestrian and/or bicycle access is contrary to public
safety

An alternative route already exists or will be built as part of the project
that is equally or more safe and convenient in terms of distance and
travel time

- The cost of the facilities would be disproportionate (exceeding 20% of
the cost of the overall project)

Sparse population or other measurable factors indicate an absence of
need

Significant adverse environmental effects would result from the inclusion
of the facilities in the project

- Opposition by 2/3 or more of the property owners whose property lies
directly adjacent to the facilities

“Constructed" is defined as the construction of a new roadway or portion of a
roadway that did not previously exist including projects to increase the
capacity of an existing street or road. For the purposes of this section,
“Reconstructed” is defined as the existing full improvement of a roadway, but
which does not include additional lane capacity. It does not include the
repair, rehabilitation or overlay of existing paved surfaces, landscaping,
signing, signafization or routine maintenance that does not include the
widening of the road surface. For the purposes of this section “Urban Areas”
is defined as the Fresno Clovis Metropolitan Area and the incorporated cities
of Fresno County.

• Flexibility if Needs Are Met: in 2012, 2017, and 2021 the Fresno County
Transportation Authority will review the status of all jurisdictions’ Master Plans
for Trail, Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities If the Authority determines at a
public hearing that a jurisdiction’s Master Plan for Trail, Bicycle and
Pedestrian Facilities is less than five years old when last adopted, and the
Master Plan has been completed at each of these five year marks, the
earmark requirements are suspended until the next evaluation and revert to
the overall local allocation category for flexible use by the local jurisdiction.

APPENDIX D - IMPLEMENTING GUIDELINES:

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM

URBAN AND RURAL ALLOCATION PROGRAMS

Funding Parameters

The Regional Transportation Program (RTP-MC) component of the Measure “C”
Expenditure Plan includes Tier 1 and 2 lists of both urban and rural street and road
projects within Fresno County and its cities. The Tier 1 and Tier 2 projects are
included as Tables 2 through 5. The projects provide for the movement of goods,
services, and people throughout the county. The Measure “G" allocation for the Tier 1
program is 50% for urban projects and 50% for rural projects. In addition, in order to
accomplish the Tier I program in a timely fashion, a minimum of 75% of the State
Transportation improvement Program funds due to the Fresno County region over the
twenty-year life of the Measure “G” (2007-2027) shall be committed to this Tier 1
program. It is anticipated that 20% of the total program shall be funded through
implementation of a Regional Transportation Mitigation Fee (RTMF) on new or
expanded development that increases traffic impacts.

Although it is the primary purpose of the RTP-MC funds to augment Tier 1 funding
levels, there is recognition that it is difficult to accurately project revenues/expenditures
for a 20-year period. Therefore, in the event that additional resources (e.g. federal or
state earmarks) are made available to fully fund all of the Tier 1 projects, then it is
acknowledged that the Fresno County Transportation Authority (Authority), in
consultation with the Council of Fresno County Governments (Fresno COG), will have
the flexibility to fund other urban and rural street and road projects contained in the
Tier 2 list of regional transportation projects. This would be accomplished through the
Expenditure Plan update process, and appropriate Tier 2 list project(s) would be
amended into the Tier 1 funded program.

Regional Transportation Mitigation Fee

The RTMF shall be developed and approved by the Fresno COG and Authority in
coordination with ail local jurisdictions. Fresno COG shall contract with a qualified
individual or firm with experience in the development of such mitigation fees to
conduct a RTMF Study, which will serve as the foundation for development of a RTMF

FR 188-024

program. The RTMF shall also be structured to effectively address improvements
identified in the Fresno-Madera County Freeway Deficiency Study.

The RTMF shall cover the 20-year period of Measure “C”. The RTMF shall apply to
Regional Transportation Program-Measure “G” projects identified in Tier 1, Tier 2 and
other such regional projects as may be identified in the RTMF Study. Such process
shall be consistent with state law and shall require analysis of growth of travel demand
for each agency, identify regional road improvements to meet such demands,
describe the appropriate “nexus” between such demand and improvements, and
adopt appropriate mitigation fees. The RTMF shall be adjusted to reflect actual
construction costs every 5 years, but shall be adjusted annually on July 1 st to reflect
the percentage increase or decrease in the Engineering News Record Index for the
California Cities for the twelve (12) month period preceding December of each year.

The RTMF shall be enacted by all cities in the County and by Fresno County to
become effective by no later than January 1, 2009. For any jurisdiction that collects
mitigation fees for any regional transportation project listed in theyRTP-MC prior to the
January 1, 2009 deadline, those fees may be factored into the RTMF fee analysis for
that project to insure that development is equitably assessed in accordance with State
law. Fees will be collected by each local jurisdiction and transmitted to the Authority
on a schedule to be determined by the Authority. It is imporiarit to the implementation
of the RTP-MC that every incorporated city in the County and Fresno County enact the
RTMF. If any city or Fresno County should choose to not implement the RTMF, then
that agency shall forfeit annually from the Local Transportation Program Street
Maintenance Allocation an amount equal to the amount of RTMF that would otherwise
have been paid for development projects within that jurisdiction during the year, if an
agency chooses to not implement the RTMF, that agency shall notify the Authority of
such decision and shall file an advisory report with the Authority for each development
indicating the amount of RTMF that would have been paid. . The Authority shall make a
total calculation of RTMF obligation on an annual basis and deduct the appropriate
amount of funds for the RTMF from the Local Transportation Program allocation for
that agency.

The Authority, consistent with the adopted and updated Measure “C” Expenditure
Plan, shall have the authority and flexibility to allocate the RTMF based upon regional
priority need within the county as defined by the RTP-MC and consistent with State
law governing impact mitigation fees.

Regional traffic impacts shall be determined based upon the COG Regional
Transportation Model analysis. The RTMF shall apply to all types of land uses and to
the extent possible limit the number of categories of fees to agriculture, single family
residential, multi-family residential, commercial-office, commercial-retail, light
industrial, heavy industrial and certain traffic generating non-essential public facilities.
Essential public facilities, as defined by state law, shall be exempt from such fees.
However, provision should be made for unique types of land uses to be evaluated on
an individual basis. Such unique projects and specific evaluation shall be paid for by
the project applicant and performed by Fresno COG or its designee.

It is in the public interest and welfare to make exception for certain types of land uses.
To that purpose, affordable housing shall be required to pay only 50% of any fee
established for the land use category. Affordable housing is defined as housing
affordable to persons with 80% of Fresno County median income or less annually.
The definition for median income and affordable housing is as provided annually by
the U. S. Housing & Urban Development Agency (HUD) to the County of Fresno.

FRESNO AIRPORTS PROGRAM

The two public-owned and operated airports in the City of Fresno [Fresno Yosemite
International (FYI) and Fresno-Chandler] are important components of both the urban
and rural area transportation systems, FYI is critical to continued economic
development in Fresno County and the Central San Joaquin Valley and Fresno-

Chandler competes very well for federal and state funds. As a result, funds allocated
to this program are expected to leverage a considerable amount of additional state
and federal funds for improvements at the airports. Tier 2 airport projects are
considered for funding once Tier 1 projects have been programmed or implemented
and if additional funding is still available over the 20-year period. Details regarding the
funding process and implementing guidelines will be further defined by Fresno COG
and considered for approval by the Authority.

ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM

| RA%$? <JNSOLID'AT?@N

P' X U020-17	~~~	""	——	1	“

The following implementing guidelines apply to the Rail Consolidation Program:

•	Should rail consolidation occur, the land along the BNSF tracks will revert
back to the City and County of Fresno for trails, bikeways, and pedestrian
facilities

•	The issue of rail consolidation and an evaluation of its feasibility and
likelihood of securing the additional funding are to be included in the biennial
update of the Expenditure Plan. A more thorough review should take place
at ten (10) years

•	If rail consolidation is not programmed with construction eminent within 15
years after the Measure passes, the funds would revert to grade separation
projects that coordinate with transit improvements and provide the greatest
amount of congestion relief and air quality benefit

•	A portion of the funds should be allocated (allowed) to fund the effort of
securing the additional funding from state, federal, or other agencies to fully
fund rail consolidation. This would include financing a position to seek the
additional funding, securing the services of a lobbyist for the project, and
working on operations issues along the corridors

» The Fresno Area Residents for Rail Consolidation (FARRC) and the City of
Fresno would work with the Authority to pursue the additional funding details
regarding the funding process and implementing guidelines will be further
defined by Fresno COG and considered for approval by the Authority.

APPENDIX F - IMPLEMENTING GUIDELINES:

ENVIRONMENTAL ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM

TRANSIT ORIENTED INFRASTRUCTURE FOR IN-FILL DEVELOPMENT

The proposed Measure “C” Transit Oriented Infrastructure for In-Fill Program would
fund planning and incentives to cities for leveraging land use changes that increase
demand for transit and the economics of transit that include:

•	Identification of selected nodal transit sites and transit corridors for Transit
Oriented Development (TOD) investment

•	Environmental and design studies related to TOD implementation

•	Incentives to developers to build compact designs with higher residential
densities, mixed-uses, and open space that are characteristic of well
implemented TOD in other cities

•	Off-set for capital costs for TOD related infrastructure

•	Leverage of costs for TOD related land acquisition

Definition and Goals: TOD refers to development that supports increased demand for
transit with higher density and mixed land uses accessible to transit nodes. Goals of
TOD for the Measure “C” Transit Oriented Infrastructure for In-Fill allocation are to
support community-based transit projects that are:

•	Developed through an inclusive planning process with broad private-public
partnerships and outreach

•	Improve the range of transportation choices by supporting transit facilities
and improving links between facilities and activity nodes

•	Support well-designed, high-density housing and mixed uses near transit

FR 188-026

Three kinds of programs are recommended with a community advisory committee

providing details:

•	Transportation infrastructure improvements to transit facilities to encourage
safety and access to transit facilities, support in-fill development or
revitalization, reduce traffic congestion at transit stations, and provide for a
wider range of transportation choices and improved internal mobility. Funds
could be used for preliminary design and environmental studies, engineering,
land acquisition, and construction

•	Planning Program or matching money to identify nodal transit sites on transit
corridors for transit oriented development, planning retrofit for existing
neighborhoods, downtowns, commercial cores, and transit station areas and
stops in order to create access to transit and mixed use development in
transit friendly environments. The community planning process would result
in transportation/land-use concept plans; streetscape design concept plans,
environmental studies, detailed drawings, construction cost estimates, and
implementation plans for specific capital projects

•	Housing in-fill incentive program that would reward local governments for
encouraging developers to build compact designs with higher housing
densities, affordable, accessible housing, and mixed uses that are
characteristic of well implemented Transit Oriented Design in other cities
developments at transit stops. Local government agencies could spend
funds to supplement development fees or on a capital project that supports
new housing development connections to transit

A community advisory/technical committee is recommended to provide design
specifics such as performance standards for the program. Revenues should be
accumulated until Public Transit Infrastructure Studies identify transit corridors and
transit nodes throughout the County. Details regarding the funding process and
implementing guidelines will be further defined by Fresno COG and considered for
approval by the Authority.

SCHOOL BUS REPLACEMENT/CNG

The following implementing guidelines apply to the School Bus Replacement
Program:

•	Use the Department of Motor Vehicles list of registered school buses in the
County, ana the priority list established based on the oldest fleet vehicles
being replaced until the remaining buses meet current air quality standards

If and when all the buses meet the standards, then funds would revert to implementing
clean fuel infrastructure. Details regarding the funding process and implementing
guidelines will be further defined by Fresno COG and considered for approval by the
Authority. In addition to cleaner fueled buses, all replaced buses will be equipped with
seat belts.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR

Renewing Measure C will generate 1.7 billion dollars plus millions in matching funds
for safer roads and traffic relief throughout Fresno County-without new taxes.

This is not an increase in the Fresno County sales tax. It extends the current voter-
approved sales tax that has generated over 1,250 miles of improvements to local
streets and highways since 1986. Millions of dollars in state/federal matching funds
have been leveraged to complete voter-approved projects as promised.

Our local population is expected to increase by over forty percent by 2026. Without
Measure C, traffic will become more congested, the local economy will suffer, and our
roads could become unsafe and dangerous.

Measure C will:

•	ensure that all funds stay in Fresno County and cannot be taken by the
State

•	improve highways 99, 41, 168,180

•	create a Citizens Oversight Committee and audit expenditures to ensure
funds are spent as promised

•	improve public safety and emergency response times, public
transportation, transit services for seniors and the disabled, and air quality
with new clean burning fuel school buses

•	support a vibrant regional economy by generating over $1.7 billion for
Fresno County transportation projects

•	improve over 100 miles of roads and highways including the 20 mile
extension of Highway 180 east and west, upgrade 15 freeway interchanges,
repair an additional 50 miles of local highways

•	add bike lanes and community trails countywide

•	repair potholes, synchronize traffic signals and improve local streets and rural
roads for safer and more efficient traffic flow

•	improve safety for school age children by adding seat belts to school buses
and providing local transportation funding for projects such as improving
school routes and crossings.

•	qualify Fresno County for billions in matching funds that will otherwise be lost
to other counties.

Please join us in supporting Measure C for transportation improvements countywide
without raising taxes.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR

Measure C is a bad proposal that doesn’t address important transportation issues.

•	By ignoring east/west streets to Highway 99, Measure C will increase traffic
congestion causing more air pollution and reduced safety

•	Measure C spends 30% of funds on alternative transportation that studies
show is used by no more than 2% of the population. They want to force you
onto public busses by congesting our streets. Are you going to ride the bus?

•	The original Measure C plan was developed by transportation experts. This
extension was developed by a tightly selected group of special interests -
environmentalists, political groups, unions and developers

•	Measure C is incomplete. The phrase “details...will be further defined later” is
used repeatedly and over 20 new designated studies are funded. This is a tax
that studies the problem, not fixes the problem.

•	This Measure C extension limits our ability to compete for matching funds on
critical projects such as Highway 99

•	The claim of dire consequences if Measure C fails simply isn’t true. Just like
schools bonds, if this plan fails you’ll be asked to vote on another plan soon.
A no vote simply says you want a plan that does more for congestion relief.

The local population is expected to increase by over 40 percent by 2026, further

congesting our streets. This Measure C does not provide real solutions to Fresno

County’s transportation problems.

Vote No on Measure C - Fresno County can do better.

ARGUMENT AGAINST

Don’t be fooled.

This is NOT the Measure C that built Fresno’s Freeways.

It doesn’t fix east-west congestion in Fresno/Ciovis. Highway 99 gets no new lanes
through Fresno. There are no repairs to the Highway 41/Herndon parking lot.

Instead, this Measure C funds farm worker vans, free taxi rides and downtown
Fresno people-movers.

It’s political boondoggles amok. All that’s missing is the Disneyland submarine ride.

This is NOT the Measure C that returned tax dollars to taxpayers.

bid Measure C spent 70% of its freeway monies in the urban region. Where 70% of
our community lives. Where 70% of the sales taxes are collated. It returned taxes to
the taxpayers.

This Measure C returns just 50% of freeway monies to the urban community.
Taxpayers haven’t moved out of the cities. Cities still suffer the most congestion.
Why abandon the old formula?

The California Public Policy Institute reports that 64% of Valley residents believe our
region’s problems are caused because government spends on the wrong things.
With this Measure C our region’s transportation monies will be spent on the wrong
things.

This is NOT the Measure C that kept promises to Voters.

There’s a map showing new projects to be bought with your sales tax dollars. But
read the fine print. Only half the map's road improvements will be built. And most
will be built with $500 Million of state and federal gas taxes our local governments
receive without Measure C.

Under old Measure C, the politicians asked for higher taxes. Now they claim they
need temporary taxes another 20 years. Besides, you weren’t spending that money
to begin with.

So, they say Measure C isn’t a tax increase. But that’s a half truth. A no vote means
lower sales taxes. A yes vote means higher sales taxes.

si Chris Mathys
President

Valley Taxpayers Coalition

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST

Mr. Mathys falsely declares that Measure C will fund the “wrong things”.

Do these projects sound like the “wrong things” to you: Repairing potholes and local
highways, protecting children by installing seat belts, improving air quality by
replacing old school buses with clean fuel school buses, improving public safety, or
improving transit for seniors and disabled persons?

Measure C will support a vibrant regional economy and qualify Fresno County for our
fair share of state and local matching funds.

Mathys’ argument is full of inaccuracies and scare tactics intended to mislead voters.
We’re supporting Measure C because of the facts:

Measure C DOES improve east-west congestion in Fresno/Ciovis with regional funds
that will add lanes to both Herndon and Shaw Avenues, intersection improvements
and synchronized traffic signals.

More than 2/3 of Measure C funds WILL be spent where most of the community lives
and where most taxes are collected. This is significantly more than the inaccurate
figure claimed by Mathys.

Measure C is NOT a tax increase and passage will NOT mean higher sales taxes than
we currently pay. It’s an extension of the voter-approved Measure C that has been
responsible for major improvements to roads and highways across Fresno County.

An INDEPENDENT Citizens Oversight Committee and expenditure audits will ensure
that Measure C funds are spent efficiently and only on voter-approved projects.

Please join an unprecedented Fresno County coalition of Republicans, Democrats,
Independents, Business, Labor, Agriculture, Environmentalists, Public Safety and the
League of Women Voters in supporting Measure C.
