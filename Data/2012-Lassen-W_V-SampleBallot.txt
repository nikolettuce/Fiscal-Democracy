no fiscal impact on the state and local
governments. Rejecting the
referendum would result in a one-time
cost of about $1 million to the state and
counties.

LASSEN LIBRARY DISTRICT

This measure would authorize the Lassen Library District,
(“the District”) to extend a special tax to all inhabitable
dwellings units within the District. The tax levied is twenty
eight dollars ($28.00). Currently, the tax is levied upon
inhabitable dwelling units within the City of Susanville.
The District boundary was extended to the inhabitable
dwelling units within the County of Lassen effective
September 11, 2006, by the Lassen Local Agency
Formation Commission. This measure will take effect
beginning with the 2013-2014 fiscal year. The special tax
shall be used solely for the operation and maintenance
of the District. This measure will pass if two-thirds of
the registered voters of the Lassen Library District cast
a “Yes” vote. If the measure does not pass, the existing
special tax will remain as previously approved by the
voters on November 8,1994.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of
Measure “W”. If you desire a copy of the measure,
please call the elections official’s office at 530-251-
8217 and a copy will be faxed or mailed at no cost to

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE W

The Lassen Library District has an annual budget
of $131,000 and serves all of Lassen County but is
supported solely by the citizens of Susanville. In 1994
the voters within the City of Susanville passed a special
tax of $28.00 per inhabitable dwelling. This tax, and this
tax alone, constitutes the entire library budget, including
salaries, insurance, utilities, maintenance, as well as
the support programs to the smaller libraries. A vote
for Measure W will extend this tax to all the inhabitable
dwellings in Lassen County.

The library has been in operation since 1915 and is a
cornerstone of the community. Each year the library
serves over 43,000 patrons, circulates more than 40,000
items, provides over 17,700 hours of computer sessions,
and offers special programs for toddlers, children, and
young adults. The Library serves as a test-proctoring
site for colleges and universities, and is the only GED
testing center for Lassen County, which allows adults to
earn high-school equivalency, increasingly essential for
getting jobs.

In 2006 the library’s boundaries were expanded to cover
the entire county with the intention of providing additional
services to all county residents. However, the lack of
financial resources has prevented this. Since state library
funding has dropped to zero, the Lassen Library has
gone from a bare-bones operation to a barely surviving
one. No one associated with the library receives health
care or benefits; we have zero budget for books; we have
cut hours drastically. A yes vote would bolster financial
viability, enable more comprehensive services throughout
the county, restore operating hours, upgrade technology,
and maintain the facility. An equitable percentage of
the tax revenue will return to local libraries in direct and
indirect support.

100% of the revenue received from the passage of
Measure W will stay in Lassen County and support the
libraries.

SPALDING COMMUNITY SERVICES DISTRICT,
VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT SPECIAL TAX

This measure would authorize the Spalding Community
Services District, Volunteer Fire Department, (“the District”)
to repeal the 1998 special tax and enact a new special
tax on all taxable real property and structures within the
District. The tax levied will be seventy dollars ($70.00) per
taxable improved parcels located within the District, per
year, for improved parcels containing a structure existing
thereon, other than a storage building consisting of less
than 100 square feet, or a parcel to which a sewer and/
or water connection has been provided which facilitates
occupancy of the property through a recreational vehicle
or in any other manner. Unimproved parcels shall be
taxed at the rate of twenty-six dollars ($26.00) per taxable
parcel, per year. This measure will take effect beginning
with the 2013-2014 fiscal year. The special tax shall be
used solely for the purpose of providing fire suppression,
protection, prevention, rescue, ambulance and other
emergency services within the District which the District
is authorized by law to provide, for any responses outside
of the District under mutual aid agreements with other fire
suppression or emergency service agencies and for any
incidental expense relating thereto including expenses
related to the collection of the tax. The taxes will be
collected on the County of Lassen property tax bill in the
same manner and subject to the same penalty as the
county property taxes are collected. Any property owner
who is assessed a special tax as provided for herein may
appeal any determination by the District concerning the
nature of the use of the property or the calculation of the
amount of the tax by filing a notice of appeal with the
District office. This measure will pass if two-thirds of the
registered voters of the Spalding Community Services
District cast a “Yes” vote. If the measure does not pass,
the existing special tax will remain as previously approved
by the voters on February 3, 1998.

Measure “V”, If you desire a copy of the measure,

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE V

Fire Department funding comes strictly from a fire
assessment tax that has not been changed since
its inception in 1985. Much of the fire equipment is
aging and will, in the near future, need to be replaced.
With the current tax structure, the District collects
approximately $30,000 which only pays for worker’s
comp insurance, administrative overhead, utilities and
vehicle maintenance. If this tax assessment is approved,
the Fire Department would collect about $63,000 per
year. This will allow us to buy needed small equipment
and firefighting tools, pay for fire related expenses and
begin to save for capital replacement of equipment in the
future. Without this new tax, the fire department will not
have sufficient funding to operate next fiscal year and
will have to drastically cut from their already lean budget.
No firefighters are paid for their services! State grants
usually require a 50% match which the Fire Department
can no longer afford. Our volunteer Fire Fighters respond
to approximately 35 medical emergencies and several
fire and accident calls each year. They need this funding
to continue their valuable work!
