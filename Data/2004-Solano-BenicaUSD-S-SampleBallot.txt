MEASURE S

To maintain high quality local education, protect local schools from budget cuts,
improve science and mathematics programs, enhance literacy and reading
instruction, maintain music and art programs, attract and retain highly qualified
teachers and staff, and maintain college preparation and advanced placement
classes, shall Benicia Unified School District be authorized to levy, a $105.00
annual parcel tax, for 5 years beginning July 1, 2005, with exemption to persons

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF SPECIAL TAX MEASURE S

Measure S would authorize the Benicia Unified School District ("District") to levy a
special tax to support the District's schools, under California Government Code
sections 50075 et seq. and 53720 et seq.

The measure requires approval by two-thirds of the voters voting on it.

If the measure is successful, the District's Governing Board is authorized to levy a
special tax for a period of 5 years, beginning July 1, 2005, at the annual rate of
$105.00, on each assessor's parcel located wholly or partially within the District, with
an exemption for any parcel whose beneficial owner has attained the age of 65 on or
before July 1 of any assessment year and who uses that parcel as his or her principal
place of residence. The measure also provides for an application process to treat
certain contiguous parcels as a single parcel for purposes of the special assessment.

The proceeds derived from the special tax will be applied only for the following
specific purposes: (1) improve science programs; (2) enhance literacy and reading
instruction; (3) improve mathematics programs; (4) maintain music and art
programs at all school levels; (5) attract and maintain highly qualified teachers and
staff; and (6) maintain college preparation and advanced placement classes.

The District will appoint an independent community oversight board to monitor and
audit the use of the proceeds to ensure that funds are spent wisely and only for the
specific purposes approved by the voters. The committee will report on at least a
quarterly basis to the governing body and to the community.

The District will place the proceeds in a separate account and the District's chief
fiscal officer will issue an annual report to the governing body showing the amount of
funds collected and spent and the status of the authorized programs.

If two-thirds of the voters voting on the measure do not vote for approval, the
measure will fail and the proposed special tax will not be levied.

The voters entitled to vote on the measure are all qualified voters residing within the
boundaries of the District.

The procedures required for the approval and imposition of the special tax, including
the process for submitting Measure S to a vote of the District's voters, are as
specified in the California Elections Code and Government Code.

Solano County Counsel

EC § 9500

THE ABOVE STATEMENT IS AN IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE S. IF YOU DESIRE
A COPY OF THE MEASURE, PLEASE CALL THE SOLANO COUNTY REGISTRAR OF
VOTERS AT (707) 421-6675 AND A COPY WILL BE MAILED AT NO COST TO YOU.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE S

For many years, teachers, staff, parents, and community members have worked together to
make Benicia schools among the best in the State. Most have received the California
Distinguished School award or the National Blue Ribbon School distinction. State Academic
Performance Index scores have been consistently high.

Unfortunately, the largest budget shortfall in California State history has resulted in drastic cuts
to education. Benicia schools have already endured $3,000,000 in recent budget cuts.
Administrative costs have been substantially reduced and are 20% less than most school
districts in California. Tough budgetary decisions have been made, spending has been
prioritized, and waste and inefficiency has been eliminated. Benicia schools are facing
additional cuts of $3,500,000 over the next two years, which will have a profoundly negative
impact on all students. Without additional funding, vital student programs will be eliminated.

Measure S is needed to maintain excellent schools with high student achievement. Specifically,
Measure S will generate funds to:

•	Improve math and science programs

•	Enhance literacy and reading programs

•	Attract and retain quality teachers and staff

•	Maintain college preparation and advanced placement classes

•	Maintain library services

Seniors 65 and over are eligible to receive an exemption. Measure S is tax deductible, and all
funds will stay in Benicia to benefit our students. Quality schools are an asset to the community
and improve property values.

An independent citizen’s oversight committee will ensure Measure S funds are spent properly,
with quarterly reports and independent annual audits. It is supported by a broad coalition of
teachers, parents, senior citizens, and business and community leaders.

Because of our excellent schools, we have been called the “Crown Jewel of Solano County.”
Measure S is a valuable investment in our children, grandchildren, and our community.

Please vote YES on Measure S.
