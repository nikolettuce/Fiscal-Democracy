COUNTY COUNSEL'S IMPARTIAL
ANALYSIS OF MEASURE O

COUNTY SERVICE AREA 29
SPECIAL TAX

This measure was placed on the ballot by Marin County Board of Supervisors to authorize a parcel tax
for ongoing maintenance and dredging in the principal waterways of Paradise Cay along with the north
and south entry channels to San Francisco Bay.

If this measure is approved by a two-thirds vote, the County Service Area 29 will increase the existing
parcel tax of one thousand two hundred dollars ($1200.00), to one thousand five hundred dollars
($1,500.00) annually upon all real property original lots located within the Service Area, with
increases limited to 3% a year, for a period often (10) years, commencing in FY 2017—2018 and
continuing through 2026—2027.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE

O

Approval of Measure "O" increases the County Service Area No. 29 (CSA29) parcel tax from $1,200
per riparian lot per year to $1,500 per lot per year, and authorizes yearly increases not to exceed 3%
per year, for the ten-year period beginning July 2018. The original projections that led to the $1,200

per year tax were done in 2006, and are believed to be inadequate going forward due to increased
dredging costs.

The CSA29 Advisory Board believes that dredging costs over the next ten years will exceed $2M,
based on increased costs from the last two dredging episodes (2009/10 and 2013/14). Bids for the
2014 dredging episode came in between $24 and $34 per cubic yard; over double the bids from 2009.
The Advisory Board believes that the increased assessment should cover the next two dredging
episodes over the 10-year period.

Maintaining our waterways is vital in protecting property values and also ensuring that Paradise Cay
continues to be a desirable place in which to live. No other water-oriented community in Marin County
has the enviable record for the frequency and cost effectiveness of dredging as CSA29. Without the
revenues generated from CSA29 Paradise Cay would be a very different community, and there are
multiple examples of once-water-oriented communities in the Bay Area (and Marin County) whose
desirability has lapsed as a result of the lack of commitment to maintain dredging in the waterways
surrounding those communities.

The CSA29 Advisory Board of Harry Blake, Bill Canada, Bob Cerf, Pat Lopez, Gene Royal and I urge
you to VOTE YES on Measure "O".
