64 ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME (AIDS). De-
clares AIDS virus carrier a contagious condition, subject to quarantine
and reportable disease regulation. Fiscal impact: the measure’s cost
could vary greatly depending upon its interpretation by health officers
and courts. If existing discretionary communicable disease controls
were applied to AIDS, given the current state of medical knowledge,
there would be no substantial change in state and local costs. If measure
were interpreted to require added disease controls, costs could range to
hundreds of millions of dollars per year depending on measures taken.

would depend on many factors, but could exceed $1,000,000 annually.
Costs would be partially offset by fines collected.

sea., be created and authorized to impose a retail transactions and use tax ordinance, applicable in the
incorporated and unincorporated territory of the County, said tax to be for a term not exceeding twenty
(20) years at a rate not to exceed 'h of 1% of the gross receipts of all retailers within Fresno County, as
specified in detail in Revenue and Taxation Code Section 7251 et sea., said tax proceeds to be used for
the purposes set forth in Public Utilities Code Sections 142000 et seq.? Further, shall the Authority be
authorized to issue bonds payable solely from the proceeds of the tax?

COUNTY OF FRESNO TAX,

MEASURE C
(Impartial Analysis By County Counsel)

The Legislature has established a Fresno County Transportation Authority with the power to impose,
subject to approval by a majority of the voters, a one-half cent increase in the sales tax in Fresno County
for up to 20 years. The tax is called a retail transactions and use tax. Proceeds from the tax would be used
for highway and transportation purposes.

All qualified electors who reside within the boundaries of the County of Fresno will be entitled to vote on
this measure. If a majority of those voting vote for approval, the Fresno County Transportation Authority
will be authorized to impose a retail transactions and use tax within the cities and the unincorporated
areas of Fresno County at a maximum rate of one-half of one percent for highway and transportation
purposes and to issue bonds payable from the proceeds of that tax. The tax could be imposed for a
maximum of twenty years and would be collected as part of the sales tax.

Not more than 75 percent of the tax proceeds would be allocated for highway capital improvements such
as rehabilitation, reconstruction, widening and safety improvements on existing roads and highways, and
for construction of freeways or expressways. Not more than 70 percent of the funds for highway capital
improvements could be allocated within the Fresno-Clovis Metropolitan area; the balance would be
allocated for highway capital improvements within the rest of the County.

Not less than 25 percent of the tax proceeds would be allocated to each city and the county for local
transportation purposes determined to be priority projects by the local governments to which the funds
are allocated.

If a majority of the qualified electors voting on this measure do not vote for approval, the measure will fail,
the Fresno County Transportation Authority will cease to exist, and the proposed retail transactions and
use tax will not be levied.

This analysis is prepared and submitted to the voters in accordance with Section 3781 of the Elections
Code.

COUNTY OF FRESNO TAX,

MEASURE C
(Argument Against)

A GENERAL SALES TAX TO SUBSIDIZE FREEWAY CONSTRUCTION AND ROADS WILL CREATE GREATER
PROBLEMS, NOT SOLVE THEM,

An outright subsidy to freeways and roads would create more traffic and encourage urban sprawl. The
measure would create more smog.

There would be more traffic because freeways encourage more and longer trips. Urban sprawl increases
as freeways allow companies to locate on city outskirts, where land is cheaper, even though commuters
have to travel longer distances to work. This increased usage, brought about by your tax subsidy, would
soon return traffic congestion to pre-tax levels. This tax would bring no relief from congestion. In fact,
congestion would be greater. A freeway increases the demand for automobile and truck traffic by its very
creation (or widening).

A SALES TAX TO SUBSIDIZE ROADS IS UNFAIR.

A blanket tax on sales would penalize those who work near or at their homes, those who choose to take
transit or bicycle to work, and those who do not work, including retirees. The people that don't cause
traffic congestion would be forced to pay for those who do.

Additionally, a sales tax burden falls most heavily on poor people, who pay a larger share of their income
to sales tax.

MORE GOVERNMENT - LESS BENEFIT.

A new bureaucratic entity would be created, staffed and funded by taxpayers, duplicating state and
county agencies already assigned road and highway responsibilities.

State funding for Fresno’s highways could be reduced, partially offsetting revenues generated through
local sales taxes.

A GASOLINE TAX IS A BETTER WAY TO PAY FOR ROAD MAINTENANCE AND CONSTRUCTION.

The people that use roads should be the people that pay for the roads. A gasoline tax does that, a sales tax
doesn't.
