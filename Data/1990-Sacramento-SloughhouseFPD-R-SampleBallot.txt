REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE R

VOTE YES, or vote for unnecessary, repressive, unfair tax.

Apparently our District Board feels the end justifies the means. They supported speedy
procedure, unfair tax and demise of a 42 year old Fire District.

VOTE YES, for good government.

The residents of Rancho Murieta have better fire insurance rates since RMA built the
firehouse, and have benefited by having better fire and emergency health service. Homes
and lives have been saved. Rancho Murieta residents have enjoyed reductions in their fire
insurance because of the.Firehouse. Only Rancho Murieta residents enjoy the better rate,
other district residents have a worse rate.

The original reorganization resolutions passed by SFPD and ARFPD on Jan. 22 and 23.
respectively, didn’t require continuation of this repugnant benefit assessment.

It was after RMA decided, in an apparent fit of greed, to use this reorganization to'enrich
itself, by profiting on the sale of the Firehouse, that extension of the tax was made a
condition of reorganization.

VOTE YES, vote for fair benefit, not excess enrichment.

If FIMA wanted profit, they could have bought stocks. They built a firehouse, received
benefits like vastly. increased fire and emergency service, and reduced insurance
premiums. Now they want more profit! RMA members would take moneys from their tax
pocket that could offset moneys into their RMA pocket. NO WAY. Other rural residents
just get taken.

VOTE YES. RMA members support reason, not greed.
