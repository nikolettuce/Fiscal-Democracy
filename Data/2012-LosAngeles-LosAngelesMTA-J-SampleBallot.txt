IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE J

By John F. Krattli, County Counsel

Approval of Measure J would authorize adoption of an ordinance proposed by
the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (“Metro”), to
extend the previously approved Measure R retail transactions and use tax
(“Sales Tax”) for an additional 30 years, from 2039 to 2069, at the current rate of
one-half of one percent (0.5%), as well as the adoption of an expenditure plan.
The Sales Tax extension may be terminated by the voters following adoption and
qualification of a ballot initiative pursuant to the Elections Code and Public
Utilities Code.

Measure R was approved by the voters in 2008 to impose the Sales Tax for an
initial 30 years to raise revenue for transportation related expenditures, including
expanding and enhancing rail and bus systems, improving highways, repairing
potholes and streets, and suspending scheduled fare increases. Measure J will
extend the Sales Tax for an additional 30 years from 2039 to 2069. Revenues
from the Sales Tax extension shall be used to accelerate the completion of
Measure R projects until those projects are complete, and to provide reduced
fares to senior citizens, disabled individuals and students and to expand Metro’s
reduced fare programs, and other expenses as provided in the ordinance. To the
extent necessary to accelerate completion of a project, Metro may authorize
expenditure of funds derived from the initial Measure R Sales Tax.

Once the Measure R projects are complete, the revenues received from the Sales
Tax extension would be allocated solely for the transportation purposes
described in the ordinance. Such funds would be available only for projects and
programs described in the expenditure plan of the ordinance.

Metro may adopt an amendment by a two-thirds (2/3) vote to transfer net
revenues between the Transit Capital Subfund and the Highway Capital Subfund
within the same subregion. All other provisions remain the same as stated in the
ordinance implementing Measure R, with the prior establishment of an
Independent Taxpayer Oversight Committee and the annual audit requirements
to remain in effect.

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE J (Continued)

This measure requires a two thirds (2/3) vote of the qualified voters in the
County of Los Angeles who cast votes in the election. The Sales Tax would only
be extended if the State Legislature approves pending legislation specifically
authorizing the Sales Tax extension, providing that the Sales Tax extension is
exempt from the rate limit established by law, and does not mandate expenditure
of the Sales Tax extension revenues in a manner different or contrary to Metro’s
expenditure plan. Assuming legislative approvals are obtained and are effective
prior to January 2, 2013, Measure J would tax effect on January 2, 2013, with the
Sales Tax extension imposed on July 1, 2039, immediately upon expiration of the
initial Sales Tax.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE J

Measure J will create hundreds of thousands of jobs in LA County over the next
decade by speeding up local highway and transit projects. Measure J accelerates
the completion of public transit projects and provides more funding for
countywide highway, transit, and local street improvements by continuing the
County’s voter-approved one-half cent traffic relief sales tax without a tax rate
increase.

CREATES OVER 400,000 JOBS. With LA County suffering 12 percent
unemployment, Measure J will create over 410,000 local jobs, according to the
Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation.

SPEEDS UP PROJECTS. Measure J will speed up the completion of light rail,
subway and airport connection projects in just 13 years rather than 27 years. It
enables local cities to fix thousands of potholes annually and repair congested
and deteriorated roads countywide.

IMPROVES FREEWAY TRAFFIC FLOW. Measure J will improve traffic flow
on the 5,10,14, 60, 101,110, 134, 138, 210, 405, 605 and 710 freeways. Measure J
will upgrade our aging freeway and highway system, including bridge and tunnel
improvements, and help prepare for hundreds of thousands of additional cars
expected in coming decades.

IMPROVES EARTHQUAKE SAFETY. Measure J will speed the earthquake
repair of aging bridges, tunnels and overpasses.

KEEPS SENIOR FARES LOW. Measure J keeps bus fares low for seniors,
students and the disabled.

ALL FUNDS STAY LOCAL, WITH STRICT ACCOUNTABILITY
PROVISIONS. Measure J requires that all revenues stay in Los Angeles County,
with no money for Sacramento. By law, funds can be used ONLY for
transportation improvement projects and services with annual independent
audits and full public review of expenditures.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE J

Measure J is filled with FALSE PROMISES of job creation and accelerated
traffic relief. It manipulates voters into paying more taxes without accountability
or protections on how that money is spent.

Measure J falsely promises accelerated projects but the truth is:

-NO ACCELERATION of the Green Line connection to LAX without outside
funding

-NO FUNDING for rail connections to our regional airports—Long Beach,
Ontario, Bob Hope, Palmdale

-NO FUNDING for the Crenshaw Line’s Leimart Park Station and Wilshire
Extension

-NO FUNDING to extend the Gold Line to Claremont
-NO FULL FUNDING for the 1-405 Corridor Project
- NO HELP for the Exposition Line to Santa Monica

Measure J proponents intentionally overstate the creation of jobs in Los Angeles
County. Jobs can only be created if struggling federal and state agencies give us
billions of dollars to complete Measure J projects.

Measure J won’t fix gridlock. The same projects were already promised in 2008,
but will now take 60 years of taxation instead of 30.

Measure J DOESN’T MANDATE “funding ... bridges, safety and traffic flow
improvements; fixing potholes.”

Measure J DOESN’T MANDATE “keeping senior, student, disabled fares low.”

Measure J SHORTCHANGES Metrolink’s fair share of funding to improve
passenger safety and travel speed—by locking in Metrolink at 3%.

Measure J disenfranchises growing cities and unincorporated communities - by
tying funding to frozen 2004 population levels.

Measure J forces a heavy burden onto taxpayers, creating massive debt for our
grandchildren - all for one political, multi-billion dollar bloated subway.

Join local business leaders, Chambers of Commerce and elected officials and
vote NO on Measure J.

ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE J

Measure J may sound great, but it’s classic bait-and-switch! It is deeply flawed,
inequitable, and ill-timed.

In 2008, Measure R promised the voters of Los Angeles County that if they taxed
themselves for the next 30 years through a half-cent sales tax, they’d have new
transportation projects delivered on time and on budget to ease traffic
congestion throughout the County.

Now, just 4 years later, Metro is coming back asking for more of your money.
Why? Because they know the higher taxes you’re already paying aren’t enough to
finish the projects they promised you.

Just because the money is accelerated doesn’t mean the projects you were
promised will get completed. Measure J relies on funding that is not guaranteed.
For example, the Green Line to LAX cannot be built without outside funding. In
fact, there is no money to connect rail to the Long Beach, Ontario, Bob Hope or
Palmdale airports as Measure J promises.

Because Measure J only accelerates projects already on the books, it won’t create
any new lobs that wouldn’t have been created under Measure R.

Measure J is just a way for all County residents to pay for the pet projects of one
municipality and does not guarantee that all 88 cities get their fair share. For
example, San Fernando Valley represents 37% of Los Angeles City population,
but they only received 13% of the City’s Measure R funding. Some Los Angeles
County residents will be paying taxes until 2069 that will never be invested in
their communities.

Measure R listed specific projects for construction and only allowed changes to
that list after 10 years. Measure J removes those taxpayer protections and allows
special interests to move money right now.

We need honest, responsible traffic relief - but a blank check that our kids and
grandkids will pay for the next 60 years is not the answer. Vote NO on
Measure J!

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE J

Measure J rejects the old pork-barrel politics that gave us congested freeways in
favor of immediate jobs and traffic relief.

OUR COUNTY NEEDS JOBS NOW. Measure J creates jobs now, when
unemployed workers in Los Angeles County need them most and construction
prices are low. Accelerating highway and transportation projects will create

410,000	jobs over the next ten years.

COUNTYWIDE PLAN. Measure J is a countywide plan. The first major project
was the Orange Line extension in the San Fernando Valley, completed
on schedule and under budget. Measure J will accelerate projects in the San
Fernando Valley, South Bay, San Gabriel Valley, southeast Los Angeles County
and North County. This includes a new transit line connecting the San Fernando
Valley to West Los Angeles and highway improvements in all parts of the county.

INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT. Measure J mandates independent oversight by a
committee of retired judges to make sure tax dollars are spent properly.

LOCALLY-CONTROLLED STREET REPAIR. Measure J means every city and
every part of unincorporated Los Angeles County will get 30 additional years of
locally-controlled funding to invest in better streets, roads, sidewalks and transit.

JOBS NOW, INVESTMENT FOR THE FUTURE. Measure J is an investment in
the future. Measure J means jobs now and a modem, efficient transportation
system that works for everyone for the long-term.

Vote YES on Measure J!
