_____________________MEASURE	M____________________________

ADVISORY VOTE ONLY. Shall the American River Fire Protection District

___ continue the existing Fire Suppression Assessment Fee, to fund operations

within the area formerly served by the Sloughhouse Fire District, through
December31,2000?_________________________

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE M

PREPARED BY COUNTY COUNSEL

Measure M is an advisory measure asking whether the American River Fire Protection
District should continue an existing fire suppression assessment fee through December 31,
2000. This assessment fee funds operations within the area formerly served by the
Sloughhouse Fire District. This measure is advisory in nature and would have no binding
legal effect if approved by the voters.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE M

Firefighting operations in the Rancho Murieta/Sloughhouse area are currently funded
through property taxes and a Fire Suppression Assessment Fee. The Assessment Fee was
originally established in 1987 by the former Sloughhouse Fire District to help pay for
firefighting equipment and personnel. At the time it was implemented, the Fee represented
approximately 20% of the fire department’s total revenues.

In 1990, the former Sloughhouse Fire District consolidated with the American River Fire
Protection District. As a condition of that consolidation, the number of full time firefighters
and firefighter/paramedics on duty in the area doubled. Also as a part of that consolidation,
local residents voted on and overwhelmingly approved continuing the Fire Suppression
Assessment Fee, at its 1987 rate, for five (5) years.

Since 1990, the Fire Suppression Assessment Fee has supplemented area property taxes
enabling the American River Fire Protection District to maintain the existing firefighting
services. Unfortunately, the slowing economy combined with rising operating costs has
necessitated renewing the Fee through December 31,2000. If Measure M receives less than
a majority YES vote, the Board of Directors of the District may be forced to review alternative
methods for dealing with the funding of operations in the former Sloughhouse Fire Protection
District, including the potential for reduction in service levels.

The American River Fire Protection District is proud of the service it has provided over the
years, however, without a YES vote the District may be unable to maintain your existing level
of fire protection services. Safeguard your family, your property and yourself. Vote to
continue quality fire protection services. Vote YES on Measure M!
