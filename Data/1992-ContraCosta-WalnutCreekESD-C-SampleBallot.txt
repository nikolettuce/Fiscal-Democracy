Our local elementary and intermediate schools need additional local funds in order to adequately
prepare out students for the future. Measure C is a direct investment in our schools and in
our community.

The facts are:

* Measure C is the first- request for community support from our local elementary school
district in more than 15 years.

The Walnut Creek School District has cut nearly three quarters of a million dollars— over
Vi — from its budget this year.

»

*	These cuts have increased class sizes. They have removed many essential academic
programs from our schools and drastically reduced library programs.

4 The District cannot rely on state funds. Cuts in state education programs and declining
lottery revenue have led to the crisis in our schools. The dependable funds our schools
need must come from our local community.

*	Measure 0 is the only means by which the Walnut Creek School District can generate

Passage of Measure C will raise those local funds. Measure C will raise approximately $960,000
per year, funds that will be used:

*	to restore and maintain basic academic programs and services;

' to restore library programs;

' to minimize increases in class size:

*	to provide up-to-date textbooks and related materials, and

*	to restore services for students needing additional help in reading, math and English.

Measure C will raise these local funds at a reasonable cost, ft will cost each parcel owner $60
per year —only $5 per month. Most homeowners own one parcel. This cost will never change
and will provide our schools with a stable source of locally controlled revenue for the next eight
years.
