IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL
MEASURE D

If this Measure is approved by a two-thirds vote, the Marinwood
Community Services District shall be authorized to impose an annual
special tax of One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($150.00) per improved parcel
for the stated purposes. If the measure passes, the Marinwood

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE D

Marinwood Community Services District needs your help to pass
Measure D to enable the District to continue to, maintain Marinwood's
parks, open space and street landscape to a level expected by the
community.

Measure D will raise the existing $75 special tax to $150. The $75
special tax has been in place since 1988. It currently makes up about
35% of the maintenance budget, the balance of which must come from
general property taxes. Despite aggressive cost cutting, the CSD is
unable to continue an acceptable level of maintenance - inflation and
the taking of property taxes by the State have taken their toil. The park
maintenance staff has been reduced from seven to five full-time
workers. Nevertheless, these workers are still responsible for the
maintenance of 15 acres of park, 10 acres of roadside landscaping, 16
pedestrian walkways and over 700 acres of open space.

The proposed tax can only be used for park, street landscape and open
space maintenance. It cannot be used for building or pool
maintenance, or for recreation activities.

Maintaining and-enhancing the community infrastructure increases
property values and adds to the quality of life that makes Marinwood
such a desirable place to live. We urge you to adopt Measure D.
