Measure K: Card Room Business License Tax, City of Emeryville


To maintain the high quality of life and unique character of Emeryville, continue to fund 
emergency services, and fund other vital City services, shall the City of Emeryville increase 
the business license tax imposed on the business of operating, conducting, or managing a card 
room, from 9% of gross receipts per month or $1,000.00 per table per month, whichever is 
greater, to 10% of gross receipts per month or $1,000.00 per table per month, whichever is 
greater?



Impartial Analysis from Emeryville City Attorney

The purpose of this measure is to adopt an ordinance increasing the existing business license 
tax imposed on persons engaged in the business of operating, conducting or managing a card room 
in the City of Emeryville to provide for general municipal services. Under Proposition 218, 
adopted in 1996, proposed tax and fee increases must be placed on the ballot for voter approval.


Currently, the business license tax imposed on card room businesses is the greater of nine percent 
(9%) of gross receipts or $1,000.00 per approved card table, paid on a monthly basis. Under the 
proposed ordinance, the business license tax imposed on card room businesses would be increased to 
the greater of ten percent (10%) of gross receipts or $1,000.00 per approved card table, paid on a 
monthly basis. A YES vote will increase the business license tax imposed on card room businesses to 
the greater of ten percent (10%) of gross receipts or $1,000.00 per approved card table, paid on a 
monthly basis.

 A NO vote will not increase the business license tax imposed on card room businesses; 
however, the present business license tax imposed on card room businesses, which is the greater 
of nine percent (9%) of gross receipts or $1,000.00 per approved card table, paid on a monthly 
basis, will remain in effect.

Arguments For Measure K

Vote YES on K to support our local community and preserve the quality of life in Emeryville!

Measure K only impacts the Card Room, it is not a tax on residents. It simply increases an 
important revenue source to ensure that our City can maintain the high quality of public safety, 
maintain parks and greenways, street repair, and emergency services.
Did you know that due to the 
weak economy and the state budget crisis, the City has been forced to make significant reductions 
to vital city services? Emeryville has been forced to make millions of dollars in cuts, including:
	
•	implemented a hiring freeze and lay-offs of 8% of the City's workforce
	
•	reduced street sweeping and tree trimming throughout the City
	
•	eliminated Library Services Contract 

Our City cannot continue to provide the level of 
service that citizens want and need, without additional funding. Without this measure, essential 
City services will be further cut.
YES on K can help offset some of the revenue that Emeryville will 
lose to the State.
YES on K generates local funds for OUR local needs. Every cent stays in Emeryville 
to maintain the services important to residents.
Emeryville is a special community with excellent 
services and programs residents value. Supporting the services that make Emeryville a great community 
is important to our quality of life. Emeryville residents and businesses are extremely proud and enjoy 
the benefits of our clean, safe, and well-maintained city. Many residents live in Emeryville because 
it offers a higher level of service, programs and quality of life than neighboring cities.
Yes on K 
ensures the Card Room continues to pay its fair share to support services vital to our City's character.

Vote YES on K to keep Emeryville a quality community.
