IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL ROSAMOND COMMUNITY SERVICES DISTRICT MEASUREG	ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE G ROSAMOND COMMUNITY SERVICES DISTRICT
A "yes' vote by a majority of voters voting on this measure will authorize the Board of Directors of the Rosamond Community Services District ("District") to exercise its powers for the purpose of public recreation.  A community services district can exercise only those powers authorized by the State Legislature and approved by a majority vote of the District’s residents. State law permits a community services district to exercise its powers for the purpose of public recreation and the District wishes to add the authority to provide public recreation to its existing powers. If a majority of the voters voting on this measure vote "yes", the District will be authorized to exercise its powers for public recreation. Measure H on this ballot is a separate measure that requests voter approval of a special tax to finance the public recreational facilities or services provided by the District.	Since 1958, only two parks have been built while our population has increased from 1,500 to 15,000. In 1968 Rosamond had four little league teams using one field. Today, Rosamond supports 21 little league baseball teams on that same one field. With 23 youth soccer teams as well as youth football and adult softball teams we need more fields to play on. We also have many other needs such as after school programs, walking trails, tot, adult and senior programs.  Alihough State law requires a percentage of each development be dedicated for parks, the County has not always enforced this law. In 1994, the County and a developer jointly broke their five-year old promise to build a park on the east side of Rosamond. The County will not be putting a park in Rosamond in the foreseeable future as the county has several other communities as higher priority. With our increased population, we need more parks to provide recreational activities. Should we continue to rely on the County or should we accept responsibility for ourselves?  There exists in Rosamond a government body which includes local elected officials who are responsive to the needs of the residents of Rosamond. This governmental body is known as the Rosamond Community Services District (RCSD). Measure G gives RCSD the ability to hold developers responsible and meet the needs of a growing community. Once given the power RCSD will hold community forums to get input from the public on how to develop YOUR parks.  The time has come to accept responsibility for our own direction. Measure G both needs and deserves your support. Vote YES ON Measure G.  Recommends approval of Measure G.  s/Gary Sperling, President Rosamond Community Services District

; IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL ROSAMOND COMMUNITY SERVICES DISTRICT MEASURE H	ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE H ROSAMOND COMMUNITY SERVICES DISTRICT
\ “yes" vote by at least two-thirds (2/3rds) of the voters voting on this measure will authorize the Rosamond Community Services District ("District") to levy a special tax for the purpose of financing public recreation, an additional power for which voter approval is requested in Measure G. The maximum amount of the special tax to be levied for the purpose of public recreation is $45 per year per rarcet of real property located within the District and the minimum amount is $5 )er year per parcel. The special tax rates shall automatically increase each year n accordance with the Consumer Price Index ("CPI") applicable to the District,  , rut in no case may the CPI exceed two percent (2%) of the special tax levied in he previous fiscal year.  f Measure G is approved, the District may continue to levy this annual special ax while the District has the authority to exercise public recreation powers. Other han the automatic increase tied to the CPI and capped at 2%, the special tax nay not be increased by the District without first obtaining voter approval. The imount levied annually per parcel shall be determined based on the amount lecessary.to pay the costs of services for providing public recreation and to pay or the cost of collection of the tax. The proceeds of the special tax may only be ised for those purposes.  f this measure is not approved by at least two-thirds (2/3rds) of the voters voting m the measure, the District will not be authorized to levy and collect the special ax to finance public recreation. Also, Measure G must be approved by a majority •ote in order for the District to have the authority to exercise its powers for the lurpose of public recreation, which power will be financed by the proceeds of this special tax.	Rosamond’s population (within the boundaries of Rosamond Community Serv- ices District) has increase nearly 10 times since 1958, when the first park was built. We now have need for more parks as well as other activities and facilities such as after school programs, senior programs, hiking/wailing trails and tot lots.  A new park with youth baseball/softball fields with outfields that double as regulation soccer o; football fields, BBQ/picnic areas, tot lots, basketball courts etc. .. will meet some of our needs. In addition to parks, RCSD can set up/run such activities as children and craft centers, education activities, games and athletic contests. After a park is built, cost of the programs that RCSD will administer will remain and the amount of the special tax can decrease until the next park is planned, approved and built.  The value each of us receives in new recreation areas for our families far exceeds the special tax maximum of $45,00 per parcel per year.  The time has come to accept responsibility for our own direction. Measure H both needs and deserves your support.  Recommends approval of Measure H  s/Gary Sperling, President Rosamond Community Services District
