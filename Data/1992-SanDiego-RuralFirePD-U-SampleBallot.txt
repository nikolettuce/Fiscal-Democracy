REBUTTAL TO THE ARGUMENT AGAINST PROPOSITION C

OVER 108,000 SAN DIEGANS SIGNED THIS INITIATIVE
TELLING THE POLITICIANS: "OUR SAFETY COMES FIRST”

FROM A $1.9 BILLION BUDGET WITH 50% WELFARE FRAUD, WHY CAN'T WE HIRE ENOUGH
DEPUTIES TO PROTECT YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD OR OPEN OUR JAILS?

The two politicians who signed .the argument against Proposition C won't explain why the Grand
Jury documented over $70 MILLION in welfare fraud last year. We estimate the first year the
S.A.F.E. County Minimum Staffing Measure cost will be just over $7 million. Who says the County
cannot afford minimum public protection?

•	THE PEACE OFFICERS RISKING THEIR LIVES EACH DAY TO PROTECT YOU AND
YOUR FAMILY, or

•	THE POLITICIANS AND BUREAUCRATS OPPOSING THIS MEASURE?

Is law enforcement really a County priority? Court documents show San Diego is ranked 56th out
of 58 counties in per capita spending for law enforcement. Most spending increases go for the care
and feeding of inmates, not for catching neighborhood crooks.

When government does not work, the citizens must take charge. The Minimum Staffing Measure
forces the Board of Supervisors to control crime; putting peace officers to work protecting you!
Urgent calls will be answered, burglars caught, and car thieves brought to justice. Our jails will
become operational. The 150 unsolved homicides will be properly investigated.

WHO DO YOU TRUST MORE:

IF LAW ENFORCEMENT WAS TRULY A PRIORITY,
WOULD THIS INITIATIVE HAVE BEEN NECESSARY?

YOUR MOST IMPORTANT VOTE IN 1992!!

THIS VOTE MAKES YOUR SAFETY THE FIRST PRIORITY

FOR A S.A.F.E. COUNTY. VOTE "YES” ON PROPOSITION Cl

RURAL FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT
Proposition U

Should the Rural Fire Protection District pass an addi-
tional tax to maintain the current level of fire and emer-
gency services, due to the Governor and California
Legislature breaking their promise of Proposition 13, not to compromise
public safety?

PROPU

Shall a maximum of $17.50 per parcel, and $30.00 per commercial and
industrial parcel be assessed not to exceed the amount lost to the state?

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION U

As of 8/21/92, the State of California has not adopted a budget. Current proposals from State
legislators during ongoing budget hearings continue to target money from local governments. The
State Legislature refuses to reduce their expenses yet will not hesitate to impact local fire
protection services by allocating local Government funds for State budget shortfalls.

The projected shortfall for the Rural Fire Protection District if the State accomplishes its local funds
appropriation plan will be a minimum of 20% ($90,000.00) of the current operating budget.

The Rural Fire Protection District currently serves 690 sq. miles in the southeastern part of San
Diego County with volunteer firefighters and minimal administrative staff. The Rural Fire Protection
District has been extremely effective In providing training and equipment to the volunteer
firefighters resulting In a cost efficient and capable fire service force that serves the local
communities. The per capita cost of the Rural Fire Protection District's service delivery Is the lowest
In San Diego County.

The proposed local fund appropriation by the State will absolutely devastate the Rural Fire
Protection District's ability to serve the citizens of the District. There Is no where left to make cuts
in the current RFPD operating budget. Fixed expenses include workers compensation and liability
insurance. The emergency apparatus fleet has to be maintained and the firefighters must be
trained and equipped to serve the public.

The choice the Rural Fire Protection District must make is to either generate a revenue source to
replace the money appropriated by the State or reduce services. This would include fire station
closures and reduction In volunteer firefighters and services. These actions would be the only
option to the States’ Irresponsibility in taking local funds to fix State budget problems.

The Rural Fire Protection Board of Directors will not enact this measure (Prop. “U") if the State
takes actions to reduce their own expenses. Proposition "U" WOULD NOT exceed $17.50 per
household per year. Proposition “U" will be a stand-by measure only.

REBUTTAL TO THE ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION U

VOTE “NO" on PROPOSITION "U”l

PROPERTY TAXES WERE ORIGINALLY LEVIED TO FINANCE PROPERTY RELATED SERVICES
SUCH AS POLICE AND FIRE PROTECTION.

People in the State of California — no matter where they live — pay the SAME 1% OF THEIR
ASSESSED VALUATION FOR PROPERTY TAXES.

Is It FAIR for property owners in the RFPD to ONLY RECEIVE ABOUT SIX CENTS (6c) BACK ON
EACH PROPERTY TAX DOLLAR FOR OUR FIREyEMERGENCY SERVICES — WHILE OTHER
FIRE DISTRICTS RECEIVE BETWEEN TWENTY TO THIRTY CENTS (20c to 30c) BACK FOR
THEIRS?

The RFPD needs to sponsor a court case as has been recommended by a previous RFPD
Board composed of True Butler, Pat Marinos, Beverly Clark, Mike Kuykendall, and Gordon
Hammers IN ORDER FOR OUR RESIDENTS TO GET THEIR FAIR SHARE OF OUR PROPERTY
TAXES FOR FIRE PROTECTION.

Many areas of the Rural Fire Protection District are ALREADY PAYING A $50.00 BENEFIT FEE
(otherwise known as AN ADDITIONAL PROPERTY TAX) for fire services.

IT IS TIME FOR STATE AND COUNTY OFFICIALS TO RETURN AN EQUITABLE AMOUNT OF
PROPERTY TAXES (IN COMPARISON TO OTHER FIRE DISTRICTS) IN ORDER TO PROVIDE
PROPER FUNDING FOR FIRE AND EMERGENCY SERVICES TO OUR RESIDENTS.

TAX AND SPEND GOVERNMENT HAS TO STOP SOMEWHERE AND THIS IS YOUR
OPPORTUNITY TO DRAW THE UNE.

VOTE “NO" on PROPOSITION “U" WHICH HAS NO SUNSET CLAUSEI
VOTE "NO” on ANOTHER TAX INCREASE!
