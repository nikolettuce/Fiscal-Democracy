NOW, THEREFORE, THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF
MOORPARK DOES HEREBY RESOLVE AS FOLLOWS:

Section 1. Each of the above recitals is true and

correct.

Section 2. Resolution No. 90-690 is hereby
attached hereto and incorporated herein as Exhibit A.

Section 3. A community facilities district to be
designated "community Facilities District No. 1 of the City

-2-

Section 6. The City Council has considered the
Negative Declaration prepared with respect to the formation
of the District and the financing of the Services which is
on file with the City Clerk and finds, on the basis of the
initial study attached thereto, that there is no substantial

approves the Negative Declaration. The City Clerk is hereby
authorized and directed to file a Notice of Determination
and a copy of the Negative Declaration with the County

collection of the special tax and all other costs related to
the special tax levy and District operations. The rate and
method of apportionment of the special tax are described in
detail in Exhibit B, which is attached hereto and
incorporated herein by reference. Exhibit B allows each
property owner within the District to estimate the maximum
amount that may be levied against each parcel. The City
Council hereby determines the rate and method of
apportionment of the special tax set forth in Exhibit B to
be reasonable. The special tax is apportioned to each
parcel pursuant to Section 53325.3 of the Act and such
special tax is not on or based upon the ownership of real
property.

proposed Services are necessary to meet the present demand
as well as any increased demand that will result from new
development within the District.

the District, the specified types of Services and the
levying of the special tax are not on file from more than
50% of the registered voters nor by property owners of one-
half (1/2) or more of the area of land within the District.
