IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL
LASSEN LIBRARY DISTRICT
DISTRICT FORMATION AND PARCEL FEE MEASURE A

The Lassen County Friends of the Library has initiated proceedings to
form a Library District, to operate independently of the County, under
the authority of the California Education Code Section 19400 et seq.
The Local Area Formation Commission and the Lassen County Board of
Supervisors approved the concept of the formation of the District, The
boundaries of this Library District will be the same as the boundaries of
the City of Susanville. Measure A is submitted to the qualified electors
within such City limits. Approval by a majority is required.

The background of this measure is that the County of Lassen is fiscally
unable to further maintain the County Free Library system within the
County, and various volunteer efforts and pledges of financial participa-
tion have not materialized as a means of permanent library support. A
Library District has been chosen as a means of continuing free library
services to residents of, and taxpayers within, the proposed District.

The funding of the Library District would be a $28.00 annual fee im-
posed upon each inhabitable dwelling unit located within the City. Pur-
suant to California Constitution Article XII IB, § 4, the Local Area
Formation Commission has set an annual appropriations limit of
$150,000. The appropriations limit is derived from the budget of the
operation of the library over the past three years with an allowance for
future inflation.

The revenues so derived could be used only for the purposes defined
by Education Code § 19460, et seq., (the payment of salaries and
benefits of library personnel, the acquisition or improvement of sites for
library buildings, the construction, alteration, repair or maintenance of
library buildings, or the acquisition, repair or maintenance of furniture or
equipment for the library buildings, the acquisition, repair, maintenance
of library materials, or all or any combination thereof) and would not be
subject to diversion or redirection by the State. The fee would be levied
annually on the lien date, March 1. The measure would have no effect
on existing law.

ADVISORY MEASURE 8

Measure B, if passed by a majority of the voters of Lassen
County, would advise the State Legislature that the voters of Las-
sen County desire that the State Legislature place a California
Constitutional Amendment on the next statewide ballot which
would give local governments (for example, Lassen County) the
authority to: (1) decline to implement any programs mandated by
State or Federal government for which the full funding necessary
to perform the services mandated is not provided by such State
of Federal government, or, (2) discontinue any such program al-
ready mandated if the State or Federal funding of such program
runs out.

NO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF OR AGAINST
THIS MEASURE WAS SUBMITTED

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE A
The County Library has closed! A “NO” vote in November will close our
City Library on November 11, 1994. We believe library closure is un-
thinkable! To keep our library - - VOTE YES on Measure “A”.

If a new library district is formed in November, the City of Susanville
will operate our library through December 31, 1995. If Measure “A”
loses, the City Library is lost in November 1994.

During three of the past four years the City has funded the library as
well as paying its own routine operating costs by deficit spending. By
Dudget cuts and community donations the City Library will be open.
Staffing will be reduced; operating hours are yet to be determined.

The current library financing process is not working. The library
needs our help! Measure “A" provides that beginning November 1995,
jach inhabitable dwelling will be assessed $28.00 per year (about $.50
Der week). In the Susanville vicinity 2500 homeowners pay $26.96 per
month for standard cablevision service. A family of four pays $12.82 to
616.30 for a basic hamburger combo fast-food meal. With your help we
:an maintain a district library for the cost equivalent of one month’s
eievision or two fast-food family meals.

The library is a bargain! We can not afford to lose its resources, its
services for our pre-schoolers, school youth, college students, adults,
>r seniors. Yearly the library circulates 65,000 books and receives 1750
magazines and newspapers. VOTE YES for your library — for our

uturei

For nearly eighty years our library has helped us, helped our parents
ind our children. Now it is our turn to respond to our library’s needs - -

ts cry for help!

For your library VOTE YES on Measure “A”! Call two friends; urge them
d VOTE YES too.
