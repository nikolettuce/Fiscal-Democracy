IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY BUTTE COUNTY COUNSEL
COUNTY SERVICE AREA NO. 140, ANIMAL CONTROL SERVICES
MEASURE P

The County Service Area No. 140 Measure is being submitted to the voters within the
boundaries of the proposed service area pursuant to existing law. It would not change the
existing law.

If a majority of the votes cast on the measure are "Yes", the measure will be approved,
and the service area shall be established. The service area would include all of the property
located within the unincorporated territory of the County of Butte; it would not include any
property within the incorporated territory of the County. Thus, no property within the cities
of Biggs, Chico, Gridley or Oroville or the Town of Paradise would be included within the
service area.

If the service area is established, it would be authorized to provide animal control services,
and the Board of Supervisors would be authorized to levy an annual service charge on the
real property within it to fund such services. The service charge could not exceed $4.97 per
parcel of real property in fiscal year 1993-94.

Commencing with the fiscal year 1994-95 the maximum permissible service charge could
be increased annually by 5% without any additional ballot measures being submitted to the
voters. Approval of an additional ballot measure would be required to increase the service
charge more than 5% in any one fiscal year.

The actual annual service charge could be less than the maximum permissible charge.
The actual charge could not exceed the maximum permissible charge. The actual charge would
be determined by the Board of Supervisors and adopted after a report was filed according
to law specifying the proposed service charge for each parcel of property and a public hearing
was held to hear and consider all objections or protests. The service charges adopted would
be collected at the same time and in the same manner as county property taxes are collected.

If a majority of the votes on this measure are "No", the county service area shall not
be established, and the county may not be able thereafter under current law to provide some
or all of the animal control services in question, within the boundaries of the proposed service
area, from general funds of the county.
