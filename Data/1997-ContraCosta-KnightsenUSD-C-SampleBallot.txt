ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF

SPECIAL TAX MEASURE C
TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 4,1997

I he kmghtsen School District has provided busmn. for JO yean, vv uh 25 square miles to cover, buses
arc important for r.Mmy student, v’-’ \ grid from school. Without busing, students would walk or
rule bicycles to school on narrow roads catling tv) safety concerns Others would not attend at all. and
the Disc re-, would lose State rewi or t raring dir past five years. State funding has decreased white
operational eosis have increased, causing the District to cover 3 deficit of approximately SI 2.00ft per
year, taking mono) out of programs for student instruction. Additionally, two buses arc now in need
ot replacement- rtnaneuu conditions dictate that a change must take place.

"I lu- Board considered several alternatives such as joining Liberty Transportation, charging students
to Mile the bus, eliminating busing altogether, or seeking approval of a transportation parcel tax
which would ru«> for a period of Ovc years at a rate of only $40.80 per year. Any extension of this
live year transportation parcel tax would requires new vote of the people.

2

Three public hearings were held over a three month period. At the hearings it was the unanimous
conclusion by all participants that the five year transportation parcel tax was the least expensive and
the most effective means of funding the busing program. It will provide our children a safe and
dependable way to school without having to reduce the funding of instructional programs and will

provide far replacement of two buses.

Property owners should be. able to deduct the $40 a year transportation parcel tax from their taxes, The
cost to each owner will be less that the cost of one stick of gum per day.
