Impartial analysis

The following impartial analysis was prepared for Measure A:[i]

U

The Board of the Spalding Community Services District has
approved a resolution

imposing a new special property tax of $65.00 for every identified
assessor’s parcel within the boundaries of the Spalding
Community Services District. In other words, if you own a piece of
land within the boundaries of the Spalding Community Services
District, this proposed new tax would apply to you. The proposed
new tax would be collected through the County’s normal property
tax collection system. Spalding Community Services District
wants to use the money raised from the new tax to replace aging

fire protection equipment and also to help fund fire prevention
programs.

California law requires such a property tax measure to be first
approved by the voters of

the district to which it applies. Also, the measure must be
approved by two-thirds of the votes actually cast at such an
election. If approved, the tax would become effective July 1,2015
and would apply every year thereafter.
