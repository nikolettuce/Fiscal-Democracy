(Admissions Tax)

The Admissions Tax is a tax on the admission price to
a live sporting, athletic, theatrical or entertainment event
which occurs in the City of Inglewood. It is commonly
referred to as a “visitor oriented" tax since the burden of
the tax falls on the patron of the event, often a visitor to the
City, rather than on Inglewood residents or businesses.
The tax has been in effect since 1972 and has been
increased from time to time.

Prior to September 1996 the tax amounted to sixty
cents per admission. In September, the City Council
adopted an increase in the tax equivalent to 5% of the
admission price. The increase was not intended to go into
effect until July 1, 1997 and is expected to result in an
increase in revenues of $1, 000, 000 annually.

in November 1996 the voters of the State of California
amended the Constitution by adding Article XIIIC §2 (c),
which requires that any taxes increased between January
1,1995 and November 6,1996 be approved by a majority
of the voters before it can continue to be imposed. The
Admissions Tax increase adopted by the City Council in
September 1996 is therefore required to obtain voter
approval.

This measure seeks to obtain voter approval of the
increased Admissions Tax in order to comply with the new
provisions of the California Constitution.

“The above statement is an impartial analysis of
Measure 97-A. If you desire a copy of the measure,
please call the City Clerk's Office at (310) 412-5280 and
a copy will be mailed at no cost to you.”

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION 97-A

VOTE YES TO SUPPORT STRONG CITY SERVICES
AND TO INSURE THAT EVERYONE PAYS THEIR FAIR
SHARE OF TAXES

Proposition 218 was approved by California voters in
November of 1996. Although this measure was heavily
opposed by Inglewood voters, it is now law. This
proposition requires the City to hold an election on
increases to three visitor oriented taxes that were approved
in 1996. Those tax increases were passed to strengthen
the City's negotiating position with the developer of a new
arena for the Lakers and Kings and to insure that patrons
of the Great Western Forum pay their fair share of taxes to
support City services.

The admissions tax, the parking tax, and the tax on hotel
and motel guests are paid largely by out-of-town visitors.
These visitors have always been welcomed to Inglewood,
but they must pay their fair share of taxes to support police
and fire protection, traffic and parking enforcement, the
street system, the mobile assistance program, and many
other services provided to out-of-town visitors.

The voters of Inglewood have always recognized that good
government and a high level of municipal services have to
be paid for. The voters of Inglewood have supported every
measure to maintain a strong and stable tax base to finance
City services.

Proposition 97-A increases the admissions tax, primarily for
patrons of the Forum and Hollywood Park Race Track and
Casino, from 61 cents per admission to 5% of the
admission price.

Vote YES to keep the total tax and assessment level for
residents at the current level.

Vote YES to keep the Lakers and Kings in Inglewood.

Vote YES to insure that Lakers and Kings fans pay their fair
share of taxes to support the services they receive.
