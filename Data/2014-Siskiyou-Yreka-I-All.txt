City of Yreka Sales Tax, Measure I
(November 2014)

| Text of measure

Ballot question

The question on the ballot:'2]

To improve the Yreka's Quality of Life shall a ordinance be enacted for a local sales
tax of one-quarter of one percent, solely for 1) Advancing Culture, the Arts and
Entertainment thereby stimulating business; and/or 2) Advancing Education and
Youth Activities in the City of Yreka thereby stimulating business; and 3)
Operational expenses of an overseeing independent nonprofit corporation that
expires in six years?1;

Impartial analysis

The following impartial analysis was prepared for Measure I:'1)

// The approval of this measure would enact a sales tax within the City of Yreka
intended to improve Yreka resident’s “quality of life” through the promotion of
education, youth activities, culture (including arts and entertainment) by funding
nonprofit organizations leading to increased business activity.

The measure would create an independent Quality of Life Stimulus Authority
whose board of directors would be appointed by the City Council. The Authority’s
board would decide how the sales tax revenues generated by this measure would be
used to accomplish the Quality of Life purposes identified in the measure.

The tax proceeds would be deposited into a special fund and be solely available to
support the stated Quality of Life purposes. The tax proceeds may only be used for
these purposes and cannot legally be taken away by the State. The tax proceeds
would be subject to independent annual audits. Those audits would be public
records.

The tax rate would be one-quarter of one percent (0.25%) of the retail sales price
or one-quarter of one cent for an item that costs one dollar. The tax would
automatically expire in six years from its operative date unless voters later extend it.

The total state and local tax on retail sales in Yreka is currently seven-and-a-half
percent (7.5%) of an item’s purchase price. This measure increases the total sales
tax rate to 7.75%.

Technically, a “sales tax” is a combination of “sales and use tax” and “transactions
and use tax.” Both are levied on the sale or use of tangible personal property sold at
retail, with certain limited exceptions. Retailers collect the tax at the time of sale

and remit the funds to the State Board of Equalization that administers the tax and
distributes it back for the purposes of this measure.

A “Yes” vote is a vote in favor of the tax. A “No” vote is a vote against the tax.

This measure would be approved if it receives yes votes by at least two-thirds of the
qualified electors casting votes. ^
