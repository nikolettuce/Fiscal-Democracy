S:: : v' may apply .or exemption?. This ensures that seniors on a fixt_ income will not be
unduly burdened. In fact, many seniors who reside within District boundaries are proud of the
schools and proud of riicir support for education.

Finally, the opposition claims that an unacceptable amount of funds was spent to survey voters.
A small om!o.:o of funds was spent, to ensure that the proposed tax was reasonable and that
it would he used for programs and classes that the community desired.

Do not Set more' programs be taken away front our children as a result of mooettuate support
from the Stale. Help our community and our students continue to have the programs, the
cliioKos find the opportunities they deserve,
