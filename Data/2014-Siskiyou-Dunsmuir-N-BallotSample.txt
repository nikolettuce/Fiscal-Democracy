The question on the ballot?2]

To prevent cuts and preserve and improve city services, including: maintaining and
improving services at the Dunsmuir Public Library and making improvements to
the Dunsmuir Community Building, shall the City of Dunsmuir adopt an ordinance
extending and increasing the existing local sales tax by one-quarter percent, for ten
years, providing locally controlled funding that cannot be taken by the State?!3]

Impartial analysis

The following impartial analysis was prepared for Measure N?1]

Measure N is to authorize the City Council of the City of Dunsmuir to adopt an
ordinance extending and increasing the existing local sales tax by one-quarter
percent (1/4%). If enacted, the increase would be for ten (10) years from the date of
enactment. The revenues raised would be general revenues to the City of Dunsmuir
and could be used for any purpose benefitting the City or its residents. The stated
purpose of the measure is to maintain and improve services at the Dunsmuir Public
Library and to make improvements for Dunsmuir Community Center. If passed, the
revenue raised would be considered general tax revenue. Passage requires only a
majority of the voters voting at the election. Since revenues collected by the
measure would be general revenues, they could not be dedicated to a specific
purpose. If Measure N fails, the City will continue to collect sales taxes at its
present rate?3]
