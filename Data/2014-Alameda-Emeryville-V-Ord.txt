3-3.712.	Administration of Tax.

The City Treasurer (hereinafter referred to in this article as “Tax Administrator”)
shall collect the tax imposed under this article and shall otherwise administer this article.
The Tax Administrator may make such rules and regulations, not inconsistent with this
article, as he or she may deem reasonably necessary or desirable to administer this
article, as well as necessary forms and receipts.

3-3.713. Due Dates, Delinquencies, Penalties, Interest, Administrative
Charges, and Lien Release Recordation Fees.

The tax imposed under this article is due and payable at the time the deed,
instrument, or writing effecting a transfer subject to the tax is delivered, and is
delinquent if unpaid ninety (90) days later. In cases where a transfer is effected but not
recorded with the County Recorder within ninety (90) days of the date on which the
deed, instrument, or writing was delivered, all statutes of limitations regarding liability for
the tax imposed by this article shall be tolled until the City has actual knowledge of the
transfer, at which time the tax on the unrecorded transfer shall relate back to the date
on which the deed, instrument, or writing was delivered. Penalties and interest shall be
deemed to have begun accruing on the date the deed, instrument, or writing was
delivered, and shall be the joint and several liability of the persons referred to in Section
3-3.704. In the event that the tax is not paid prior to becoming delinquent, a delinquency
penalty often (10) percent of the amount of the tax due shall accrue. In the event only a
portion of the tax is unpaid prior to becoming delinquent, the penalty shall only accrue
as to the unpaid portion. An additional penalty of fifteen (15) percent of the amount of
tax due shall accrue if the tax remains unpaid on the ninetieth (90) day following the
date of the original delinquency. Interest shall accrue at the rate of one (1) percent per
month or fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax, inclusive of penalties, from the date
the tax becomes delinquent to the date of payment. Interest and penalties shall become
part of the tax. An administrative charge and a release of lien filing fee equal to the
amount charged by the Alameda County Recorder’s Office shall be added to the
amount owed for each property approved for a tax lien by the City Council.

3-3.714. Declaration May Be Required.

The tax imposed by this article shall be paid to the Tax Administrator by the persons
referred to in Section 3-3.704. The Tax Administrator shall have the authority as part of
any rules and regulations promulgated by him or her as authorized herein to require that
the payment shall be accompanied by a declaration of the amount of tax due signed by
the person paying the tax or by their duly authorized agent. The declaration shall
include a statement that the value of the consideration on which the tax due was
computed includes all indebtedness secured by liens, deeds of trust, or other
encumbrances remaining or placed on the property transferred at the time of transfer,
and also includes all special assessments on the property which a purchaser or
transferee agrees to pay or which remains a lien on the property at the time of transfer.
The declaration shall identify the deed, instrument, or writing effecting the transfer for
which the tax is being paid. The Tax Administrator may require delivery to him or her of
a copy of such deed, instrument, or writing whenever he or she deems such to be
reasonably necessary to adequately identify such writing or to administer the provisions
of this article. The Tax Administrator may rely on the declaration as to the amount of the
tax due provided that he or she has no reason to believe that the full amount of the tax
due is not shown on the declaration.

Whenever the Tax Administrator has reason to believe that the full amount of tax
due is not shown on the declaration or has not been paid, he or she may, by notice

6

served upon any person liable for the tax, require them to furnish a true copy of their
records relevant to the value of the consideration or fair market value of the property
transferred. Such notice may be served at any time within three (3) years after
recordation of the deed, instrument, or writing which transfers such property.

3-3.715. Determination of Deficiency.

If on the basis of such information as the Tax Administrator receives pursuant to
Section 3-3.714, or on the basis of such other relevant information that comes into his
or her possession, he or she determines that the amount of tax due as set forth in the
declaration, or as paid, is insufficient, he or she may re-compute the tax due on the
basis of such information.

If the declaration referenced in Section 3-3.714 is not submitted, the Tax
Administrator may make an estimate of the value of the consideration for the property
conveyed and determine the amount of tax to be paid on the basis of any information in
his or her possession or that may come into his or her possession.

One or more deficiency determinations may be made of the amount due with
respect to any transfer.

3-3.716. Notice of Determination.

The Tax Administrator shall give written notice to a person liable for payment of the
tax imposed under this article of his or her determination made under Section 3-3.715.
Such notice shall be given within three (3) years after the recordation of the deed,
instrument, or writing effecting the transfer on which the tax deficiency determination
was made.

3-3.717. Manner of Giving Notice.

Any notice required to be given by the Tax Administrator under this article may be
served personally or by mail. If service is made by mail, it shall be made by depositing
the notice in the United States mail, in a sealed envelope with postage paid, addressed
to the person on whom it is to be served at the address as it appears in the records of
the City or as ascertained by the Tax Administrator. The service is complete at the time
of the deposit of the notice in the United States mail, without extension of time for any
reason.

3-3.718. Petition for Redetermination.

Any person against whom a determination is made under this article or any person
directly interested may petition the Tax Administrator for a redetermination within sixty
(60) days after service upon the person of notice thereof. If a petition for redetermination
is not filed in writing with the Tax Administrator, City of Emeryville, 1333 Park Avenue,
Emeryville, California 94608, within the sixty (60) day period, the determination
becomes final at the expiration of the period.

3-3.719.

Consideration of Petition—Hearing.

If a petition for redetermination is filed within the sixty (60) day period, the Tax
Administrator shall reconsider the determination and, if the person has so requested in
his or her petition, shall grant the person an oral hearing, and shall give him or her ten
(10) days’ notice of the time and place of the hearing. The Tax Administrator may
designate one or more deputies for the purpose of conducting hearings and may
continue a hearing from time to time as may be necessary.

3-3.720.	Determination of Petition.

The Tax Administrator may decrease or increase the amount of the determination
before it becomes final, but the amount may be increased only if a claim for the increase
is asserted by the Tax Administrator at or before the hearing.

3-3.721.	Finality of Determination.

The order or decision of the Tax Administrator upon a petition for redetermination
becomes final thirty (30) days after service of notice thereof upon the petitioner or at the
time of hearing of redetermination. There is no appeal of the Tax Administrator’s
decision on a petition for redetermination to the City Council. Writs challenging the Tax
Administrator’s decision must be filed with the appropriate court within ninety (90) days
of the final date of such redetermination. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1094.6.)

3-3.722.	Tax a Debt.

The amount of any tax, penalty, and interest imposed under the provisions of this
article shall be deemed a debt owed to the City. Any person owing money to the City
under the provisions of this article shall be liable in an action brought in the name of the
City for the recovery of such amount. In such action a reasonable attorney’s fee shall be
awarded the plaintiff. The provisions of this Section shall not be deemed a limitation
upon the right of the City to bring any other action, whether criminal, legal, or equitable,
based upon the failure to pay the tax, penalty, or interest imposed by this article or the
failure to comply with any of the provisions hereof.

3-3.723.	Refunds.

Whenever the amount of any tax, penalty, or interest has been overpaid, or paid
more than once, or has been erroneously collected or received by the City under this
article, it may be refunded as provided in this section, provided that a written claim
stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds on which the refund is claimed is
filed with the Tax Administrator within one (1) year of the date of payment. The claim
shall be submitted on forms furnished by the Tax Administrator. The Tax Administrator
may make such refund if he or she is satisfied that the claimant is entitled to the refund
under the provisions of this article. No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this

8

section unless the claimant establishes his or her right thereto by written records
showing entitlement thereto.

3-3.724.	Tax a Lien.

The amount of tax, penalty, and interest imposed under the provisions of this article
is assessed against the property upon the transfer of which the tax is imposed, and if
not paid when due, such tax shall constitute an assessment against such property and
shall be a lien on the property for the amount thereof, which lien shall continue until the
amount thereof including all penalties and interest are paid, or until it is discharged of
record. Any person owing money to the City under the provisions of this article shall be
liable to an action brought in the name of the City for the recovery of such amount.

3-3.725.	Notice of Hearing on Lien.

The Tax Administrator shall file with the City Manager a written notice of those
persons on whom the City will file liens. Upon the receipt of such notice, the City
Manager shall present the same to the City Council, and the City Council shall forthwith,
by resolution, fix a time and place for a public hearing on such notice.

The Tax Administrator shall cause a copy of such resolution and notice to be served
upon the persons referred to in Section 3-3.704 not less than ten (10) days prior to the
time fixed for such hearing. Such service shall be made by mailing a copy of the
resolution and notice to the transferor and transferee of property at their last known
address. Service shall be deemed complete at the time of deposit in the United States
mail.

3-3.726. Collection of Delinquent Taxes by Special Tax Roll Assessment.

If the City Council authorizes the imposition of a lien following the hearing described
in Section 3-3.725,, any delinquent tax charges which remain unpaid by the transferor
or transferee shall constitute a special assessment against said property, and shall be
collected at such time as is established by the County Assessor for inclusion in the next
property tax assessment.

The Tax Administrator shall turn over to the County Assessor for inclusion in the
next property tax assessment the total sum of unpaid delinquent charges consisting of
the delinquent transfer taxes, penalties, and interest at the rate of twelve (12) percent
per annum from the date of recordation to the date of lien.

Thereafter, said assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same
manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the same
penalties and the same procedure of sale as provided for delinquent, ordinary,
municipal taxes. The assessment lien previously imposed upon the property is
paramount to all other liens except for those of state, county, and municipal taxes with
which it shall be upon parity. The lien shall continue until the assessment and all interest
and charges due and payable thereon are paid. All taxes applicable to the levy,

collection, and enforcement of municipal taxes shall be applicable to said special
assessments.

SECTION TWO. Effective Date. This Ordinance shall become effective upon the later
of January 1, 2015, or as provided by California Elections Code Section 9217.

SECTION THREE. Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase,
or portion of this Ordinance is for any reason held to be invalid or unenforceable by a
court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining portions of this Ordinance shall
nonetheless remain in full force and effect. The people hereby declare that they would
have adopted each section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this
Ordinance, irrespective of the fact that any one or more sections, subsections,
sentences, clauses, phrases, or portions of this Ordinance be declared invalid or
unenforceable.

SECTION FOUR. Codification. Section One of this Ordinance shall be codified in the
City of Emeryville Municipal Code. Sections Two, Three, Four and Five shall not be
codified in the City of Emeryville Municipal Code.
