Chapter 3.32 is hereby added to the Dublin Municipal Code, Jo read as fol-
lows:

Section 3.32.010. Title

This chapter shall be known as the “EMS Tax Ordinance” of the City of
Dublin.

Section 3.32.020. Findings

A.	The City Council of the City of Dublin does hereby determine that the cost to
provide emergency medical services at a level required to provide for the health,
safety and general welfare of its residents exceeds the amount of funds and rev-
enues generated from all other sources of income available for such purpose. The
City Council does further determine that the imposition of an emergency medical
services tax on occupants of real property throughout the City as set forth below
is necessary to maintain an adequate level of emergency medical services.

B.	The imposition of an emergency medical services tax will allow the City to
provide a higher level of service than would otherwise be available to occupants
of real property throughout the City.

Currently, the first unit to respond to a call for emergency medical services typ-
ically is a fire engine company or fire truck company staffed with personnel
who have been trained as emergency medical technicians (“EMT’s”). The
EMTs can provide basic life support but cannot provide more advanced life sup-
port such as administering drugs or administering endotracheal intubation. The
average response time is currently ten (10) minutes before an ambulance with a
paramedic, who can provide advanced life support, arrives on the scene.

CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE E

Since 1983, emergency medical services have been provided in Dublin by the
county-wide Emergency Medical Services District and the local fire department.

Emergency medical services consist of “basic life support,” which emer-
gency medical technicians (EMT’s) can perform and “advanced life support”
which only paramedics can perform. EMT’s can assist with the patient’s airway,
breathing and circulation. Paramedics can provide cardiac monitoring, admin-
ister IV fluids and give medications.

The Emergency Medical Services District has imposed an assessment on
property owners county-wide which funds three trauma centers and emergency
medical dispatch and subsidizes the cost of paramedic/ambulance service. The
1996-97 assessment was $21.14 per single-family parcel.

The Emergency Medical Services District has imposed a supplemental
assessment in Dublin to help the City fund its local costs of providing emer-
gency medical services. These include training firefighters as EMT’s. The 1996-
97 supplemental assessment in Dublin was $3.28.

One way to conform to Proposition 218 (The Right to Vote on Taxes Act)
which was approved at the November 1996 election, is to convert the county-
wide assessment and the supplemental assessment to special taxes, subject to
voter approval.

Measure C is a county-wide measure which, if approved, would impose a
special tax to pay for the continuation of the three trauma centers, emergency
medical dispatch and the subsidy for ambulance service.

Measure E is a City measure which is separate from Measure C. Measure E
would approve a City-wide special tax in Dublin to pay for on-going costs of
providing emergency medical services, including two firefighters trained as
paramedics on duty 24 hours a day.

The special tax would be an excise tax in the amount of $10 per “benefit
unit.” Occupants of single family residences would pay $10 per year, occupants
of multi-family units would pay $6 per year and commercial, office and indus-
trial users would pay between $20 to $70 a year depending on the number of
[ “benefit units” for the type of use. The tax would be on the occupant of the
| home or building and the owner would be required to collect it. The City could
collect the tax on property tax bills.

The special tax which would be imposed if Measure E passes could only be
used for emergency medical services. The amount of the tax will not increase
over time unless approved by the voters.

To comply with Proposition 218, the City Council enacted an Ordinance
6-97 which sets forth the type of tax, amount of the tax, exemptions, refunds, use
of the proceeds and other related matters. A copy of the ordinance is printed in
the sample ballot.

As required by Proposition 218, the tax will not become effective unless
') Measure E is approved by two-thirds of those voting at the election.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE E

The City of Dublin Emergency Medical Services Tax is necessary to improve
the level of emergency services in our community. Local services are only one
component of a system designed to address medical emergencies.

The Alameda County Emergency Medical Services District proposed tax will
support important services such as: Transport Ambulances and Hospital Trauma
Centers, which are appropriately provided on a regional level. The proposed
City of Dublin Tax will address the level of care initially provided in the event
of an emergency.	//	/

The Dublin Emergency Medical Services Tax will enable the City to train
and provide sufficient fire personnel as firefighter/paramedics. This will mean
that there will be a minimum of two firefighter/paramedic units on duty 24
hours a day, operating from our local fire stations.

All proceeds from this tax will be paid into a special fund designated for use
for emergency medical services only. The tax will not automatically increase in
the future.

The availability of Emergency Medical Services is a benefit to all members of
our community. These services will enhance the health, safety, welfare and envi-
ronment of all Dublin residents and improve the quality of life both directly and
indirectly.

This Emergency Medical Services Tax will reduce the average response time
from 10 minutes to 5 minutes before personnel who can provide advanced life
support arrive on the scene. When you need help, 5 minutes can be the difference.

With a requirement for approval by two-thirds of the voters, we strongly
encourage your YES Vote on June 3rd.
