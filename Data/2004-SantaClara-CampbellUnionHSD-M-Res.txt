In Support of

District Parcel Tax

A RESOLUTION ORDERING A Special Parcel Tax ELECTION,
REQUESTING THE COUNTY ELECTIONS DEPARTMENT TO CONDUCT
THE ELECTION, REQUESTING CONSOLIDATION OF THE ELECTION,
AND SPECIFICATIONS OF THE ELECTION ORDER

WHEREAS, the California State Legislature has failed to provide adequate binding for the continued operations
of the schools (“Schools”) of the Campbell Union High School District (“District”); and as a result of this lack of
funding and financial support for the schools, the District is in danger of eliminating many programs beneficial
and necessary to the students who attend the schools of the District; and once eliminated these programs of study
will be extremely difficult to reinstitute; and

WHEREAS, the District has engaged in a variety of efforts to generate funds for the educational program,
including lobbying in the State Legislature and many local fundraising efforts, and has undertaken cost-cutting
measures, including reduction of programs and services beneficial and necessary to the students of the District;
and

WHEREAS, continued reliance solely on State funding will result in further loss of critical programs; and

WHEREAS, a thorough and developed public education program delivers many long lasting benefits and
advantages to all of the residents of our community; and

WHEREAS, without the authorization by the voters of special assessments, substantial reduction or elimination
of educational programs and services will be necessary and will have a severe impact on the students of the
District and on the community; and

WHEREAS, Section 4 of Article XIIIA of the California Constitution and Government Code sections 50075,
50076, 50077, 50079, and 53720, 53721, 53722 and 53724 authorize school districts to levy special taxes to raise
funds for the purpose of conducting their business upon the approval of two-thirds of the votes cast by voters
voting upon such special tax proposals; and

WHEREAS, the Board of Trustees has conducted a noticed public hearing, as required by law, on the question of
whether or not to request the District’s voters to authorize funding to continue the programs identified below.
