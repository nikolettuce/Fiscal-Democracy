IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
LIBRARY SPECIAL TAX ORDINANCE
MEASURE "R"*

If approved, this ordinance will authorize a special tax for support and
maintenance of the Library.

The purpose of the ordinance is to levy a special tax on each
residential dwelling unit or non-residential parcel within the City of Ojai to
pay for maintenance and operating costs of the Library, and for
administrative expenses limited to implementation of the ordinance,
including refunds involved in the collection of this special tax. The tax is
imposed annually, unless the City Council determines by June 30 before the
next fiscal year not to impose the tax for that fiscal year.

The ordinance calculates approximately One Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($100,000.00) as the amount budgeted to be received from the
special tax each fiscal year. This amount is to be used to restore the Library
to its 1992-1993 level of full-time service.

The tax rate cannot exceed the maximum established by the ordinance
without the approval of a two-thirds vote of the electors of the City of Ojai.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Ordinance or Measure
“R", prepared pursuant to Elections Code section 9280. If you desire a copy
of the ordinance or measure, please call the City Clerk's office at
(805) 646-5581 and a copy will be mailed at no cost to you.

•Section 9280 of the California Elections Code allows the City Attorney to prepare an impartial analysis of each
city measure appearing on the ballot.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE “R"

LIBRARY SPECIAL TAX ORDINANCE FOR THE CITY OF OJAI

A strong public library is an extremely important part of the foundation
upon which a community is built. It is truly an essential public service.

With its historical commitment to education and learning, our
community has kept the "Ojai Library," a branch of the County library
system, open to all since 1895. The community supported it as a vital
institution even in the Great Depression.

The continued operation of the Ojai Library is threatened. Since 1992,
cutbacks in State funding have crippled all public libraries, except where
communities have enacted special library taxes. California’s public libraries
now rank 50th in the nation in the number of hours open to the public.
Without approval of this special tax for the Ojai Library our Library will
be able to operate only on a very limited part-time basis. Its value to the
community will wither.

This special tax ordinance has been carefully structured to provide the
revenues necessary to operate a full time library. All tax proceeds will go for
direct support of the Ojai Library. The tax will never exceed $35 per year,
per residence. A special tax of this type is fully consistent with Proposition
13 and the principle of local control over municipal services.

This tax proposal amounts to $2.92 per month for a single family
home. This is not very much to pay for what the Ojai Library gives back to
our community. Please join with the entire Ojai City Council and the vast
majority of the community to cast a YES vote for Measure "R" in support of
the Ojai Library.
