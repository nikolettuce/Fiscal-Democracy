IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE L

Measure L would raise revenue to pay forthe design, construction
and furnishing of a new Monrovia Public Library to replace the
current outdated structure. The current Monrovia Public Library
building in Library Park is approximately 50-years old. The City’s
staff has reported that the current building is too small and lacks
the technology infrastructure to meet current and future needs.
The City Council has conceptually approved a floor plan and
exterior rendering for the new Monrovia Library.

If approved by 2/3 of the City’s voters, Measure L would impose a
special tax on all parcels of real property in the City. The annual
tax rates would be $62 per parcel for single-family residences,
$46 per unit for multi-family properties, $8 per space for mobile
home parks, 29 cents per square foot of building for commercial
and industrial properties and $17 per acre for vacant land. The tax
would be collected each year on the annual property tax bill.

The revenue raised by Measure L could be used only for the
design, construction and furnishing of the new Library, including
the cost of financing the project. This revenue could not be spent
for salaries or any administrative cost for the library. The law
requires that revenues from Measure L be placed in a separate
fund, subject to an independent audit each year with the results
of the audit reported to the public. The tax would be collected
only for the time necessary to repay any money the City might
borrow for the new library project or 30 years, whichever occurs
earlier, and would automatically sunset at that time.

The City Council could not extend the duration of the tax or
increase the amount of the tax without a 2/3 vote of the people.
Certain properties would be exempt from paying the tax, including
government property, property exempt from taxes under State or
federal law, and properties owned by low-income senior citizens
and disabled people who apply to the City for an exemption.

A “Yes” vote on Measure L favors imposing the parcel tax to pay
for the new Monrovia Library. A “No” vote opposes it.

Craig A. Steele, City Attorney

The foregoing is an impartial analysis of the Measure L. If
you would like to receive a complete copy of the Measure,
please call the Monrovia City Clerk’s office at 626-932-5505
and a copy will be provided to you at no charge.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE L

Vote YES on Measure L to give Monrovia the new Public Library
it both needs and deserves.

Monrovia’s current Library building has served the community well
for 50 years, but it has long since become obsolete - too small
by half for today’s population and in need of constant repair. It
lacks both room and infrastructure for needed public computers;
sufficient shelf space for books, periodicals, DVDs and tapes;
adequate seating; effective work areas and such necessities as
decent public restrooms and reliable, working air conditioning
and heating systems.

Over the years the Library has been enlarged and reorganized
to its structural limits; its aging systems repaired so often they
can no longer handle the job. Built for just 50,000 volumes, it is
inadequate to handle the 120,000 books in today’s collection,
with little room for periodicals or other media.

Yet the demand for Library services here is large and growing.
Well over 100,000 items are circulated each year and many more
requests for materials are made than can be accommodated in
the limited space available. Last year alone, 3,000 new computer
users registered to use the Library’s few workstations, 25,000
reference-related questions were answered by staff and, this
summer, 3,000 young readers devoured 55,000 books!

Measure L will cost residents just $62 per year, never a penny
more, and will build a modern facility twice the current size,
capable of handing today’s and tomorrow’s technology, designed
to maximize efficient and comfortable use in an impressive and
appropriate building.

For just $5.17 per month, the equivalent of two tall lattes,
Monrovians can have the new Library they have been seeking for
more than a decade. We strongly urge a YES vote on Measure
L.
