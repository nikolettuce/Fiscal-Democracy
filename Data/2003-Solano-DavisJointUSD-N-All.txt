IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY YOLO COUNTY COUNSEL
DAVIS JOINT UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT SPECIAL TAX PROPOSAL

This analysis of the special tax proposed by the Davis Joint Unified School District is
prepared and submitted to the voters pursuant to Elections Code Section 9500.

Government Code Sections 50070 and following authorize a city, county or district to submit
to the voters a proposal authorizing the levy of a special tax. The Davis Joint Unified School
District has proposed a special tax to support the District’s schools.

If the measure is successful, the District’s Board of Trustees will be authorized to levy a
special tax for a period of four (4) years, from July 1,2004 to June 30,2008, at an annual rate
of up to $82.95 per dwelling unit for all multi-dwelling unit parcels within the District and
$165.90 per parcel for all other parcels within the District.

The revenue derived from the special tax will be expended solely for: (i) enhancing reading
programs in the elementary grades and selected programs at the secondary level; (ii) reducing
class size at selected grade levels and in certain designated subject areas; (iii) providing
additional education program offerings for students, (iv) providing school counselors, nurses
and other support staff; (v) providing supplemental staff training for classified and certificated
employees; and (vi) providing additional classroom and library instructional materials,
technological materials, equipment and services, and other educational equipment for the
schools.

The measure also calls for annual review of the expenditures supported by the special tax.

If two-thirds of the qualified electors voting on the measure vote for approval, the measure
will succeed and the proposed special tax can be levied. If two-thirds of the qualified electors
voting on the measure do not vote for approval, the measure will fail and the proposed special
tax cannot be levied. The electors who will be entitled to vote on the measure will be all
qualified electors residing within the boundaries of the Davis Joint Unified School District.

The procedures followed for the proposal special tax, including the election process for the
voters’ consideration of the proposal, are as specified in the California Government Code and
Elections Code. This special tax proposal has no effect on existing law.

Dated: August 5,2003.

STEVEN M. BASHA, COUNTY COUNSEL
By Stephen B. Nocita, Senior Deputy

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE N

To meet the challenges of the next generation, our students have to be prepared. This means
teaching kids values for LIFE and encouraging them to take responsibility for themselves. It
means giving schools the tools they need to remove obstacles to student achievement. And it
means building on the basics in teaching reading and math. We need to teach phonics,
spelling, and math fundamentals, but also build on that foundatfon—and promote an integrated
approach that stresses problem-solving, critical thinking, with an emphasis on literature and
hands-on math application to the real world.

Your YES vote on Measure N will give the public schools the tools they need to achieve these
goals. Measure N is not a new idea. First passed in 1984 and renewed in 1987,1991,1995,
and again in 1999, your YES vote will maintain critical local support for our schciols. As you
know, Davis student test scores rank among the highest in the state. Measure N will continue
that trend.

Measure N funds will be spent only on those programs approved by the voters. Measure N will
provide critical funding for:

Elementary class size reduction (beyond state mandates).

A full-time crisis counselor.

Junior High 7“' period.

Enhanced reading programs in the elementary grades.

Enhanced reading programs in grades 7-10.

Extended hours for junior and senior high libraries.

Counseling, nursing and instructional aide services.

Up-to-date technology, as well as more classroom and library supplies and equipment.

Please Vote YES on Measure N. Remember that our kids are in each grade only once, so
every day in class matters. What they learn there has to stay with them. Because school is for
LIFE.
