<impartial> COUNTY COUNSEL’S
IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE J

The Nevada County Board of Supervisors has requested
an advisory vote of the registered voters in Western
Nevada County to determine if the voters would support
the levy of an additional property tax which would be
used to fund the acquisition of the property commonly
known as the Loma Rica Ranch for use as a park and as
open space.

Under the Board of Supervisors proposal, the County
would form a Mello-Roos Community Facilities District
and would levy a special tax thereunder in an amount
which the County estimates at $27 per year for a 20 year
period, or a one time payment of $285.00. The proceeds
of the special tax would be used specifically for the
acquisition of the Loma Rica Ranch for use as a park and
open space. The funds could not be used for any other
purpose.

The County has estimated the cost to purchase the Loma
Rica Ranch at $9,500,000 which sum would be subject to
change after a full appraisal has been prepared.

A "yes" vote means that the voter is in favor of the
proposal to levy a special tax to fund the acquisition of
the Loma Rica Ranch. A "no" vote means that the voter
does not favor such action.

This measure is only advisory and will not have any legal
or binding effect.

<fiscal> FISCAL IMPACT STATEMENT
OF MEASURE J

Measure J is strictly advisory and, therefore, has no fiscal
impact on the County.

If the Board of Supervisors elects to go forward with the
proposed project, with or without a successful advisory
vote, $9.5 million in real property would be removed from
the tax roll resulting in a first year decrease in County
general fund property tax revenue of $27,075 and a
corresponding amount indexed for growth each year
thereafter.

Bonds sold to purchase the property would be paid for by
a property tax increase. <fiscalend>

<favor> ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE J

Vote "YES" on Measure J to tell Nevada County
that you SUPPORT A LOMA RICA RANCH REGIONAL
PARK. A second vote must take place later with firm
financial figures for the purchase price and the annual
assessment amount. A Nevada County Financial Analyst
advised the Board of Supervisors that the estimated
parcel charge is $27 per year - the cost of a hamburger
and soft drink once a month. This is a small amount to
preserve 455 acres for recreation and the environment.
AND, this figure is not final. It can be offset by donations,
grants and fundraisers.

Nevada County needs park, recreational, and athletic
facilities - such as ball fields, playgrounds, picnic areas,
trails, public golf course, etc. Land for parks is
disappearing, and soon will NOT be available at any
price. Loma Rica Ranch - HERE TODAY, GONE
TOMORROW??? It’s up to you!

A "YES" vote on Measure J prevents development
which could cost taxpayers more than the proposed park
for added infrastructure, including:	12 traffic signals,

highway interchange, sewers, “the dump", schools,
police/fire protection, road/street maintenance, medical
and postal services.

Loma Rica Ranch lies between Grass Valley and
Nevada City, easily accessible to Western Nevada
County. We have the opportunity to preserve our own
"Central Park," with its existing trail system, creeks,
historic MacBoyle Lake, horse stables and track.

Loma Rica Ranch Regional Park would encourage
tourism. This clean industry stimulates private
investment, boosts the economy, creates jobs, offsets the
tax burden, and preserves the environment. The Ranch
could offer a site for a Conference/Performing Arts
Center, and other revenue-generating facilities.

A "YES" vote on Measure J sends a message: We
want to preserve and enjoy our county’s rural quality, and
historical heritage!

A "YES" vote on Measure J means OPEN SPACE
NOT GRIDLOCK!!! <favorend>

<rebutfavor> REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT
IN FAVOR OF MEASURE J

DON’T BE MISLED! The real reason behind Measure "J"
is to protect the personal and financial interests of
residents in the Loma Rica Ranch area, and commuters
using Brunswick and Idaho-Md. roads.

Protecting one’s own interests, is a legitimate activity
PROVIDED that in so doing, the burden is not shifted to
those who would derive little or no benefit from same.

Measure "J" would protect against construction of a
large home development on Loma Rica Ranch.
Simultaneously, it would also protect neighboring property
values from declining. Commuters would also benefit by
maintenance of the status-quo regarding traffic conditions.

Yet, Measure “J" provides that a house across the
street from Loma Rica Ranch would pay a tax of $27.00
per year, WHILE A HOUSE IN A RURAL AREA 10-30
MILES AWAY WOULD PAY AN EQUAL $27.00 per year,
despite probably having no interest or need for such a
park.

SHIFTING THE FINANCIAL BURDEN FROM THOSE
WHO BENEFIT THE MOST TO THOSE WHO BENEFIT
THE LEAST - IS AN IMMORAL OBSCENITY!

A more realistic distribution of the tax burden for
Measure "J", would be charging Loma Rica Ranch area
residents $270.00 in taxes per year, and charging remote
area residents $2.70 in taxes per year. - with some
graduated rates in the inbetween areas.

VOTE "NO" ON "J”. It is an irresponsible proposal,
drawn up in haste and with little thought to present or
future financial conditions in Nevada County. <rebutfavorend>

<against> ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE J

The State of California is in an economic depression.
Nevada County has unemployed and homeless people.
So, what do our County Supervisors do about it? They
want you to buy a new park for recreational purposes!

This measure should be DEFEATED! The proposed
district area is totally unrealistic--BEING MUCH TOO
LARGE! It forces REMOTE PROPERTY OWNERS who
don’t need or want a park, to have to pay for it
regardless!

This is a very sweet deal for residents near the Loma
Rica Ranch, to have almost everybody in the county pay
to bail them out of their troubles. But another name for
it is LEGALIZED ROBBERY!

The $9.5 million purchase price to acquire the Loma
Rica Ranch, is only an ESTIMATE! IT COULD BE MUCH
HIGHER!

Also, this is another one of the County Supervisors
irresponsible “credit card" financial proposals involving the
issuance of bonds. The County has squandered millions
and millions of dollars on interest charges rather than
face up to pay-as-you-go financing and trying to live
within our means. Measure "J" is more of the same.

THERE IS NO MENTION IN THIS MEASURE OF
FUTURE ANNUAL COSTS FOR PARK CAPITAL
IMPROVEMENTS, MAINTENANCE, EMPLOYEE
STAFFING AND EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS.

THE $9.5 million is ONLY THE TIP OF THE
ICEBERG!

Let Loma Rica Ranch area residents finance their
own deal-put up some real money where their mouth is-
not ride on everybody else’s back.

Help keep taxes DOWN!

VOTE “NO!” on “J". <againstend>

<rebutagainst> REBUTTAL TO
ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE J

The 9.5 million to purchase the Loma Rica Ranch is
only an estimate. This should be lowered by a thorough
assessment of the Ranch, and by bringing in money from
other sources such as grants, fund raisers and donations.
Remember, we don’t need to develop the whole park
now. The important thing is to acquire land while it is
still available. It can be developed when economic
conditions are better, and volunteer help can be used to
accomplish a lot of it.

Nevada County needs more park space. Nevada
County needs an economic boost. Loma Rica Ranch
Regional Park could provide both. It could give Nevada
County residents a place to recreate, recreation-oriented
small business a change to develop, and tourists a place
to come and spend money. It’s location between Grass
Valley and Nevada City, just off the freeway makes it
easily accessible for all of Nevada County.

If a housing/shopping center/business park
development goes into Loma Rica Ranch, what taxes will
be necessary to create all the infrastructure to support it?
According to published reports California developments
usually pay their way only THE FIRST YEAR! Guess
Who pays after that? Right! We, the Taxpayers! We
pay for qridlocked traffic, dirty air, overloaded schools,
dump and sewers, insufficient police and fire protection,
possible closure of the airport, and ail the problems
associated with a 2000 minimum increase in population
predicted by the developers.

Vote "YES" on Measure "J" to prevent this from
happening. <rebutagainstend>
