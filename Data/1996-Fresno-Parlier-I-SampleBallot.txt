CITY OF PARLIER EXCISE TAX MEASURE I

(Full Text of Measure)

For purposes of raising revenue to be used to maintain needed City services (for example, police, fire,
recreation, youth and senior programs, etc.) for the citizens of Parlier, shall the City Council of the City of
Parlier adopt a 7% general utility users tax, applicable to the use of electricity, natural gas, telephone and
cable TV?

CITY OF PARLIER EXCISE TAX MEASURE I

(Impartial Analysis by City Attorney)

Existing law of the City of Parlier does not presently provide for a telephone users tax, an electricity users
tax, a gas users tax, or a cable television users tax. These are typically called “utility users taxes.” If passed
by the electorate, this measure would authorize the City Council of the City of Parlier to consider adoption
of and thereafter to adopt an ordinance providing for the imposition of such taxes. Voter approval of this
measure does not itself impose any utility users taxes. If this measure is adopted and if thereafter the City
Council does adopt such an ordinance, this measure limits the taxes that could be imposed to a rate of not
to exceed seven percent (7%) of the charges imposed for the services taxed, in other words, this present
measure would limit the actual rate that could be adopted by the City Council; a rate lower than 7% could
be enacted by the City Council, but not a higher rate.

If after passage of this measure the City Council were to adopt an Ordinance imposing on utility customers
one or more of the specified utility users taxes, this measure would provide that the total aggregate amount
of all such taxes charged to any such utility customers could not exceed $500.00 annually.

Each utility users tax would be owed by and collected from the person paying for the services (telephone
users, electricity users, natural gas users, cable television users), and the rate charged would not exceed
seven percent (7%) of the charges imposed for such services. All such taxes would be chargeable at a rate
of, or at a rate or rates lowerthan, seven percent (7%), as may be established from time to time by resolution
or order of the City Council.

If this measure passes and if thereafter the City Council adopts an Ordinance imposing the utility users
taxes, the taxes would be paid by the utility customer and collected on a monthly basis along with the utility
bills.

CITY OF PARLIER EXCISE TAX MEASURE I

(Argument in Favor)

YOUR VOTE TO GENERATE FUNDS BY THIS INITIATIVE WILL BE USED
FOR PUBLIC SAFETY. WHICH IS THE POLICE AND FIRE SERVICES;

SENIOR SERVICES; YOUTH SERVICES; AND HELP MAINTAIN OUR PARKS & CITY FACILITIES. THE CITY
FACES INSUFFICIENT FUNDS TO ADEQUATELY FUND THE ON-GOING COSTS AND EXPENSES OF OPERA-
TION OF THE VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS, AS WELL AS THOSE COSTS AND EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH
PROVIDING FIRE PROTECTION IN PARLIER.

THEREFORE, THE CITY, IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY DEPARTMENTS, AS WELL
AS CONTINUED MAINTENANCE OF A CONTRACT WITH THE FRESNO COUNTY FIRE PROTECTION
DISTRICT, IS SEEKING TO PASS A UTILITY TAX IN THE CITY OF PARLIER.

THE RATE CHARGED WOULD NOT EXCEED 7%, WHICH IS NECESSARY TO CONTINUE AUGMENTING THE
PRESENT SERVICES PROVIDED TO THE RESIDENTS OF PARLIER. THIS UTILITY TAX WILL TAKE EFFECT
JANUARY 1,1997. THIS TAX WILL BE APPLICABLE TO GAS, ELECTRIC, TELEPHONE AND CABLE TV. THE
MAXIMUM THAT A MAJOR BUSINESS WILL PAY ON THE FOUR ACCOUNTS IS $500 PER YEAR.

THE CITY DOES NOT WANT TO REDUCE ANY OF THE SERVICES BEING PROVIDED. THIS IS WHY WE
ARE GOING TO YOU, THE VOTERS OF PARLIER, TO HELP THE CITY MAINTAIN SERVICES PRESENTLY
PROVIDED. THE CITY HAS BEEN ABLE TO SUCCEED IN ACCOMPLISHING THE FOLLOWING:
•DEVELOPMENT OF A STRONG POLICE DEPARTMENT
•CONSTRUCTED A NEW FIRE DEPARTMENT
•PROVIDED A MINI-EMERGENCY TRUCK FOR THE NEW FIRE STATION.

• DEVELOPED A SENIOR CITIZEN’S PROGRAM.

•REMODELED FACILITY FOR THE SENIOR CITIZENS.

•AND THE NEW VETERAN’S MEMORIAL PARK.

NOW, THE DECISION IS UP TO YOU, THE VOTER, TO HELP OUR COMMUNITY PROSPER, AND HELP
KEEP THE SERVICES CURRENTLY PROVIDED!
