ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURES "E* & *FB
Open Letter to Wildomar and the Plateau Communities. April 28, 2003
Dear Neighbors:

With this special election, you have Ihe opportunity to vote on
increased law enforcement and public safety services, I am in full support
of this proposal. I worked for over 35 years with the Riverside County
Sheriffs Department, which included the last eight years of my career as
your elected Sheriff. I plan to spend the remainder of my life in this neigh-
borhood, 1 know from experience that there are low levels of service in
the unincorporated areas of the County. County general funds to signifi-
cantly increase the level of service are not likely anytime in the near
future.

I am voting to support the assessment for enhanced public safety
services. The addition of staffing to focus on local public problems has
proven to be successful in other areas of the County. The contracted time
will be on top of what now exists and will serve our area well. The

additional protection for our families, homes and businesses will be well
worth the small additional assessment.

Sincerely,

Cols Byrd, Sheriff (Ret.), County of Riverside
