CLOVERDALE HEALTH CARE DISTRICT
MEASURE D

Subject to Resolution 2006-1 of the CHCD Board of

D Directors and to the specific terms thereof: Shall the
Cloverdale Healthcare District increase the levy of a
special tax on each assessor’s parcel of real property
within the district to $36 (thirty six) per parcel per year from the
current $18 (eighteen) beginning July 1,2006 to be applied solely
for the purpose of providing medical services, medical transport
services, ambulance and advanced life support service within the
Cloverdale Healthcare District Service area?

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE D

Cloverdale Health Care District operates the Cloverdale Ambulance Service,
which has been in operation locally since the 1950’s. The Ambulance Service
operated without public assistance until 1991, when the voters overwhelmingly
authorized an $18 per year, per parcel assessment.

Since 1991, the costs of operating the ambulance have increased dramatically,
while revenues / fees for services have failed to keep up with expenses.

This Measure will increase the current parcel assessment by $18 per year, or
$1.50 per month, to insure that the Health Care District remains in operation.

The Cloverdale Health Care District provides vital paramedic services to northern
Sonoma County, and is the lifeline between Cloverdale and local area hospitals
when medical emergencies arise. The closest other ambulance service is located
in Healdsburg.

We urge you to vote “yes" on Measure D.
