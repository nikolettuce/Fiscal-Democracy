COUNTY COUNSEL'S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE J

Analysis by County Counsel of General Tax (Sales Tax) Measure J

In the last several years, the total cost of employing the county workforce has risen dramatically.
Between increases in health care costs, pension contributions (CalPers), and cost of living increases, the
County has been unable to increase its workforce. In fact, over the last 10 years, the County workforce
has been reduced by 5.5%.

Additionally, the County is unable to fund its existing workforce with the revenues currently available.
For the last several years, the County has had to use its reserves just to keep status quo. In the 2017-
2018 budget year alone, $2.5 million dollars of reserves is projected to be used just to keep the existing
work force and level of service. The reserves are all but gone.

The Board of Supervisors now feels forced to either ask for an increase in revenue (sales tax increase) or
face the possibility of cutting services. The City of Susanville is in the same position, perhaps worse.

Because both the City and County believe they are in essentially the same position financially, both
considered proposing a sales tax increase this election cycle. However, rather than having two
competing tax measures on the same ballot, the City and County agreed that the County would propose
one tax increase that would, through revenue sharing, offer a solution for both.

On February 20, 2018, the Lassen County Board of Supervisors adopted Ordinance 2018-002 imposing a
.75% increase in the local sales tax. This means that for all qualifying transactions, including purchases
made by tourists and visitors alike, the amount of tax paid would increase from 7.25% to 8%. The
estimated revenue from the increase, based on recent data, would be approximately $2.1 million dollars
annually.

To become effective, this ordinance must be approved by a simple majority (50% plus one) of all votes
cast at the June 5, 2018 statewide primary election. Persons eligible to vote on the matter include all
voters in the County of Lassen and the City of Susanville. Because this is a general tax measure, the
proceeds could be used for any general County purpose including law enforcement, prosecution,
defense, parks, probation, public works, etc.

A "YES" vote on the measure is a vote in favor of authorizing the increase in the sales tax of three-
quarters of one percent.

A "NO" vote on the measure is a vote against authorizing the sales tax increase.

ADMINISTRATION

The Board of Supervisors of the County of Lassen ordains as follows:

Section 1. TITLE. This ordinance shall be known as the Lassen County Supplemental
Transactions and Use Tax Ordinance. The County of Lassen shall hereinafter be called
"County." This ordinance shall be applicable in the incorporated and unincorporated territory of
the County.

Section 2. OPERATIVE DATE. "Operative Date" means the first day of the first calendar
quarter commencing more than 110 days after the adoption of this ordinance, the date of such
adoption being as set forth below.

Section 3. PURPOSE. This ordinance is adopted to achieve the following, among other
purposes, and directs that the provisions hereof be interpreted in order to accomplish those
purposes:

A.	To impose a retail transactions and use tax in accordance with the provisions of Part 1.6
(commencing with Section 7251) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code and Section
7285 of Part 1.7 of Division 2 which authorizes the County to adopt this tax ordinance which
shall be operative if a majority of the electors voting on the measure vote to approve the
imposition of the tax at an election called for that purpose. The proceeds of this increase in the
retail transactions and use tax shall be for unrestricted general revenue purposes.

B.	To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that incorporates provisions
identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the State of California insofar as those
provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.6 of
Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.

C.	To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that imposes a tax and provides a
measure therefor that can be administered and collected by the California Department of Tax and
Fee Administration in a manner that adapts itself as fully as practicable to, and requires the least
possible deviation from, the existing statutory and administrative procedures followed by the
California Department of Tax and Fee Administration in administering and collecting the
California State Sales and Use Taxes.

D.	To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that can be administered in a
manner that will be, to the greatest degree possible, consistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of
Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting the transactions
and use taxes, and at the same time, minimize the burden of record keeping upon persons subject
to taxation under the provisions of this ordinance.

Section 4. CONTRACT WITH STATE. Prior to the operative date, the County shall
contract with the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration to perform all functions
incident to the administration and operation of this transactions and use tax ordinance; provided,
that if the County shall not have contracted with the California Department of Tax and Fee
Administration prior to the operative date, it shall nevertheless so contract and in such a case the
operative date shall be the first day of the first calendar quarter following the execution of such a
contract.

Section 5. TRANSACTIONS TAX RATE. For the privilege of selling tangible personal
property at retail, a tax is hereby imposed upon all retailers in the incorporated and
unincorporated territory of the County at the rate of 0.75% (three quarters of one percent) of the

territory on and after the operative date of this ordinance.

Section 6. PLACE OF SALE. For the purposes of this ordinance, all retail sales are
consummated at the place of business of the retailer unless the tangible personal property sold is
delivered by the retailer or his agent to an out-of-state destination or to a common carrier for
delivery to an out-of-state destination. The gross receipts from such sales shall include delivery
charges, when such charges are subject to the state sales and use tax, regardless of the place to
which delivery is made. In the event a retailer has no permanent place of business in the State or
has more than one place of business, the place or places at which the retail sales are
consummated shall be determined under rules and regulations to be prescribed and adopted by
the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration.

Section 7. USE TAX RATE. An excise tax is hereby imposed on the storage, use or other
consumption in the County of tangible personal property purchased from any retailer on and after
the operative date of this ordinance for storage, use or other consumption in said territory at the

shall include delivery charges when such charges are subject to state sales or use tax regardless of
the place to which delivery is made.

Section 8. ADOPTION OF PROVISIONS OF STATE LAW. Except as otherwise
provided in this ordinance and except insofar as they are inconsistent with the provisions of Part
1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, all of the provisions of Part 1 (commencing
with Section 6001) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code are hereby adopted and
made a part of this ordinance as though fully set forth herein.

USE TAXES. In adopting the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation
Code:

this County or any agency, officer, or employee thereof rather than by or against the California
Department of Tax and Fee Administration, in performing the functions incident to the
administration or operation of this Ordinance.

3.	In those sections, including, but not necessarily limited to sections referring
to the exterior boundaries of the State of California, where the result of the substitution would be

consumption of tangible personal property which would not be subject to tax by the state under

Section 6203.

ordinance to Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code relating to sales and use
taxes and which are not inconsistent with Part 1.6 and Part 1.7 of Division 2 of the Revenue and

contract.

Section 5. TRANSACTIONS TAX RATE. For the privilege of selling tangible personal

PROPOSED
Argument In Favor of Measure J

Vote Yes on Measure J.

Yes on J will provide locally controlled funding so that our residents and business owners can benefit
from essential public services - those that keep our families safe and our towns and neighborhoods
protected.

City and county officials are attending neighborhood watch meetings and listening very closely to
residents and business owners about their concerns about public safety. A stronger law enforcement
presence and more code enforcement is urgently needed.

Yes on J revenue will go to provide future support of public safety for City and County residents.

Approximately 69% of the County’s general fund is provided to public protection. In the last four years, the
County has increased dictionary funding to public safety from $7.3 million to $8.8 million dollars!

Unlike most areas of the State, our region has not yet recovered from the “Great Recession.” There are
demands on local roads, cemeteries, parks and trails, Veterans buildings, the fairgrounds, and other
public services. Since 2008, the County has made tough decisions to balance the budget, including
reducing the number of county-employees by 5.5 percent.

Over the past four years, the county budget has allocated one-time “Rainy Day Funds” to provide public
safety services such as sheriff patrols, 911, code enforcement and removal of illegally grown marijuana.

Yes on J ensures that out-of-town shoppers will share the cost of providing vital public services to lessen
the burden on local taxpayers. Visitors and travelers use our roads, parks, public safety and emergency
services as they enjoy all that Lassen County has to offer.

Yes on J is a direct and fair way to generate revenue from tourists and visitors that shop locally.

Unlike property taxes, this sale tax cannot be taken away by the State. ALL of the Measure J revenue will

stay in Lassen County.

Measure J sounds like a sales pitch for "patent medicine" that will solve all of our woes, aches, and pains to get
us coming back for more. Problem is. Measure J is not a long term solution.

I say again, Lassen County's economy has contracted since 1992 by $60.81 million in wages and has lost an
aggregate of 1,083 residents. This tax and other taxes are taxes on diminishing returns until we stop the self-
inflicted economic spiral. As the tax base shrinks, so does tax revenue.

Our neighboring counties have seen increases: $81 million in wages in Plumas, $553 million in Shasta, and even
$8.87 million in Modoc. California is a large weight around our ankles but ask yourselves, why are these
counties growing while ours is shrinking?

Growth is a four-letter word to some people because they want the community to stay small. How well has
staying small worked out for Lassen County?

Our government claims they are listening yet the majority of atendees speaking about the sales tax wanted a
dedicated tax for public safety.

"Out-of-town shoppers" are mentioned as helping ease the burden yet raising the transient tax on hotel rooms
was never discussed. There is no noticible tourist season locally, unlike in neighboring Chester.

The majority of the board of supervisors has not welcomed outside investment into our community for years.
Without growth, the problem will only get worse. Demand action on growth before opening your pocket book.
Vote "no" on Measure J.

Fiscal Impact Statement
Measure “J”

Ballot Measure “J” proposes a .75% district sales tax. This tax is on all sales within Lassen County,
including the incorporated area of the City of Susanville. Based on a four (4) year average of sales, this
would generate approximately $2,100,000 additional revenue with a net of increase of discretionary
revenue to the County of Lassen of approximately $1,180,000, after implementation of the newly adopted
revenue sharing agreement with the City of Susanville.

Lassen County’s discretionary funds are generated from sales tax, property tax, licenses, fees and fines.
In Fiscal Year 2017-18, these funds were budgeted 69% for Public Protection departments, 8% for Public
Assistance departments and 23% for General Government departments. In order to fully fund these
departments, Lassen County used $2,600,000 in reserves and onetime funding that will not be available
in Fiscal Year 2018-19 to balance the budget.

Lassen County’s Board of Supervisors have the responsibility to determine the priority of how the
discretionary funds are expended. The Budget process begins in the spring and the final budget is
approved in late summer. Historically the Board has appropriated the majority of the discretionary funds
to Public Protection departments. County budgets and audits are available on the County web site for
further information.

The .75% increase in sales tax will assist Lassen County in maintaining the current level of funding to
Public Protection funds and assist in developing a foundation to increase law enforcement coverage in
Lassen County.

Sincerely,

Isl

Lassen County Auditor
