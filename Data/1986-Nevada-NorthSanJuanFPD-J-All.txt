Impartial Analysis of Measure J

COUNTY COUNSEL'S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS PURSUANT TO
ELECTIONS CODE SECTION 3787 OF THE NORTH SAN JUAN
FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT SPECIAL TAX ELECTION

The North San Juan Fire Protection District seeks voter approval
of an ordinance imposing a special tax upon real property located
within the boundaries of the District. The revenues raised by this
tax are to be used solely for the purpose of providing fire protection
and rescue services. The ordinance also seeks voter approval to
establish an annual spending limit for the District in the amount
of $52,500.

Under the California Government Code Section 53978, the District
is authorized to enact an ordinance imposing a special tax if
approved by no less than two-thirds of the voters casting votes
thereon. If approved by the voters, the special tax will be levied
upon all real property within the District which is subject to taxa-
tion in the following manner:

Each improved parcel would be assessed at a rate of
$27.50 per year.

Each unimproved parcel would be assessed at a rate of

$19.50 per year.

The spending limit which the District proposes to establish is a
requirement under the California Constitution Article XIII B.
Approval here is necessary in order to authorize the District to
spend the funds which would be raised by the proposed special tax.

The ordinance does not specify the manner in which the special
taxes will be collected. State law would authorize the District to
collect the taxes or to have the taxes collected by the County of
Nevada.

Argument in Favor of Measure J

The North San Juan area has been served by a volunteer fire
department for 124 years at no cost to its residents. The Fire
Department can no longer serve 2,000 people on the sole support
of its 400 members. NSJ is the only Fire Protection District in
Nevada County that does not collect property taxes or assessments
to support itself.

With the formation of a special district in 1986, NSJ became
eligible to ask its voters to equally share in the cost of fire and
rescue services for its residents. We cannot wait 20-30 minutes
for help from Grass Valley. WE MUST PROVIDE FOR OUR OWN
MEANS OF SUPPORT, and all those who benefit from this protec-
tion must share in the cost. This ballot measure will provide
approximately $32,000 a year to a Fire Department that covers
69 square miles with an average of 150 fires and rescue calls a
year. That amount provides a budget that is $20,000 a year less
than the smallest fire district in the County, which covers only
6V2 square miles ! ! !

What higher priority can there be for a taxpayer than the
immediate protection of life and property? We urge a yes vote on
this measure.
