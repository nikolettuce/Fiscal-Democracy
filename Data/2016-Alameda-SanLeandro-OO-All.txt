CITY ATTORNEY IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
CITY OF SAN LEANDRO
BUSINESS LICENSE TAX MEASURE

Businesses operating within the City of San Leandro must obtain a business license and pay a tax
for that license. The purpose of the business license program is to raise revenue for use by the City
for any legal municipal purpose.

The City’s current business license tax rates are set forth in full in Chapter 2-2 of the San Leandro
Municipal Code. The tax rate and calculation methodology varies based on the type of business.
Some businesses pay only a flat rate. Some pay a base rate plus an additional fee for each owner
and employee. Others pay a base rate plus a percentage of their annual gross receipts. Parking lots
currently pay a base rate plus a per parking space fee.

If Measure_____is passed by the voters, the proposed ordinance would amend Chapter 2-2 to

eliminate the per owner and employee charge for all businesses with three or fewer owners and/or
employees. Those businesses would pay only the base rate.

The ordinance would also add new classifications for businesses engaged in warehousing or
storage, and for larger businesses engaged in wholesaling and distribution. For those two types of
businesses, it would change the business license tax calculation from a base rate plus employee
charge, to a base rate plus a charge per 1,000 square feet. For those categories, square feet means
all of the square feet inside the exterior walls of the building leased or owned by the business.

The ordinance would also change the tax rate for parking lots where a fee is charged for parking to
change the per parking space fee to a $ 100 charge per every $ 1,000 in gross receipts.

The City estimates that the changes could increase the amount of business taxes paid to the City by
about $800,000 per year. The business license tax is a general tax the proceeds of which could be
used for any legal municipal purpose. The tax would be ongoing. The San Leandro City Council
placed the measure on the ballot by a unanimous vote. The California Constitution, Article XIII(C),
Section 2(b) requires that an increase to or change in the method of calculating a general tax must
be approved by a majority vote of the electorate.

A “yes” vote would approve the proposed changes to the City’s business license tax rates and
methods of calculation.

A “no” vote would leave the existing business license tax rates and methods of calculation in place.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure_____. If you desire a copy of the

ordinance, please call the City Clerk’s office at 510-577-3367, and a copy will be mailed at no cost
to you.

Argument in Favor of Measure Y - Business License tax

Vote YES on Y to reduce business license taxes for San Leandro’s small businesses.

•	YES on X, Y and Z provides shelters for abused women and children

•	YES on X, Y and Z fixes potholes and repairs city streets

•	YES on X, Y and Z improves 911 emergency response times and provides a seismically safe
police operations center

•	YES on X, Y and Z enhances safety net programs for homeless and at-risk adults and children

•	YES on X, Y and Z updates the police operations center and technology so San Leandro Police
Department's crime prevention efforts will be more effective

•	YES on X, Y and Z attracts new businesses and create jobs in San Leandro

•	YES on X, Y and Z provides essential upgrades to our Library, including space for children's
story times, a homework center, public access computers and free wi-fi at Mulford-Marina
Branch

Sacramento politicians take $12,000,000 annually from San Leandro. Funding generated by Measures
X, Y and Z replaces this funding, giving San Leandro taxpayers LOCAL control over LOCAL funds for
LOCAL needs.

NO funds can be taken by Sacramento politicians.

NO money raised from Measures X, Y and Z will be used for administrator salaries.

YES on X, Y and Z are fiscally accountable. All three measures require independent citizen
oversight, mandatory financial audits, and yearly reports to the community to ensure that money is
spent as promised.

Voting YES on X, Y and Z protects San Leandro property values by maintaining quality services,
parks, open space and safe neighborhoods. Specifically, YES on Y reduces business license tax rates
for small, San Leandro businesses.

Join a unanimous City Council and San Leandro’s police officers, firefighters, teachers, neighborhood
community leaders and business leaders in voting YES on X, Y and Z!

Rebuttal to Argument in Favor of Measure_______(Business License Tax)

San Leandro’s City Council has never once reduced taxes on its citizens. The last time
taxpayers attempted to repeal a tax was 16years ago. In response, the city spent over $80,000 of
your money to defeat Measure G.

Now, they present us with new tax proposals every election cycle, claiming vital services
will be eliminated if these new taxes aren’t approved. And every time they propose new taxes,
they cross their hearts and promise the extra money will fund street maintenance, public libraries,
911 emergency services, safety net programs for the homeless and shelters for abused women
and children. And all these new taxes are guaranteed to attract new businesses and create more
jobs!

But year after year, the unemployed homeless continue to live on our streets, exposed to
the elements, and those same streets deteriorate from heavy traffic and deferred maintenance.
Meanwhile, the libraries are still open, 911 calls are still answered, after school programs
continue to be funded and life goes on as normal.

But now we have to raise the minimum wage to $15/hour and the mayor wants a raise for
herself as well!

San Leandro’s business climate attracted Amazon to open a major distribution center
here, which brought more jobs to the city, but apparently Amazon isn’t paying its fair share, so
now they must have their tax burden increased. What will happen to all of those jobs if Amazon
finds a cheaper place to move their warehouse? Please vote NO on Measure____/

Argument against San Leandro Measure_______________(Business	License	Tax)

The deceptive ballot language claims this measure reduces taxes on small businesses, but
the resolution passed last July actually imposes new taxes on warehouse operators, wholesale
distributors, moving and furniture storage companies, non-residential property owners and
parking lot operators.

The only tax reduction included in this measure is for very small businesses with three
(3) or fewer employees (hopefully including self-employed sole proprietors). These businesses
will still be required to pay the annual business license fee (ranging from $128.20 to $642.30),
but are exempt from the employee fee, which ranges from $38.50 to $96.40/employee.

Cities that succeed in attracting new businesses (e.g., Palo Alto, Sunnyvale, Mountain
View) do so by offering generous tax breaks and exemptions from regulations. In other words,
they use a carrot on a stick to lure businesses to their dream location in Silicon Valley. San
Leandro’s business plan is more like waving a big heavy stick at entrepreneurs. How is that an
incentive to attract new, larger businesses to the city?

The proposed changes aren’t likely to entice entrepreneurs to consider San Leandro as a
home base. Oakland's business taxes are much less burdensome. Oakland imposes a tax of
$60/year for businesses with less than $50,000 gross revenues per month plus 1.2% for every
$1000 of monthly revenue. Larger businesses pay $60/year plus a graduated percentage up to
4.5% for every $1000 in revenue, with special provisions for grocers and other businesses.

Cannabis businesses in Oakland pay the highest tax of all, up to $50 per $1000 of
monthly revenue. Note that this is just half the tax rate that San Leandro plans to charge cannabis
businesses!

It is clear these new taxes are directly aimed at Amazon’s new distribution center and

Costco Wholesale. Please vote NO on the Business License Tax.

[Rebuttal to argument against Measure 00 (BLT)]

Don’t be misled by political rhetoric and misinformation!

FACT: Voting YES on OO reduces business license taxes for over 2,300 of San Leandro’s small businesses.
Check this yourself by reading the Official Ballot Language of Measure 00 at www.sanleandro.org

FACT: As over 50% of all San Leandro businesses have fewer than 4 employees, a MAJORITY of our local
businesses will enjoy a TAX REDUCTION if you vote YES on OO.

FACT: YES on OO simply updates San Leandro’s outdated business license ordinance to ensure that larger
businesses pay their fair share, while reducing taxes for our small businesses.

FACT: YES on OO enables San Leandro to continue to attract new businesses, creating local jobs! Compared to
neighboring cities like Oakland, San Leandro’s business rates will continue to be much lower, allowing our
business community to remain competitive during the economic upturn.

Here’s what Measure OO WON’T do:

Measure OO WON’T raise taxes on our small business—it reduces taxes.

Measure OO is NOT a tax on San Leandro residents or property owners.

The revenue generated by voting YES on OO and Measures NN & PP will be used exclusively for maintaining
vital San Leandro services such as: providing shelter for abused women/children; fixing potholes and repairing
city streets; improving 911 emergency response times; enhancing safety net programs for homeless and at-risk
adults & children; and providing essential improvements to the San Leandro Library.

Join a unanimous Mayor and City Council and San Leandrans from every neighborhood: Vote LOCAL by voting
YES on OO, NN and PP!
