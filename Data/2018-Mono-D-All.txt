STATEMENT OF CANDIDATE FOR U.S. REPRESENTATIVE, 8TH DISTRICT  PAUL COOK  Occupation: United States Representative  Education and Qualifications: As a retired Marine Corps colonel who was wounded twice in combat, I’m committed to restoring the values and principles that made America the greatest nation on earth. In the past, you trusted me to represent you in Washington, and I’ve delivered on my promises to you. 1 ask for your vote once again this upcoming election on June 5.  1 staunchly supported the recently passed tax reform bill that lowered income taxes on individuals and businesses. Americans are already feeling the positive effects: historically low unemployment rates, wage increases, and a dramatic upswing in the growth rate of our economy. I’ve always stood for law and order, which is why I’m working to end “sanctuary” laws that protect criminals and increase crime in our communities.  I’ve worked tirelessly on the House Armed Services Committee to rebuild our depleted military after the previous president slashed military budgets. This most recent budget restores our military’s combat readiness, provides pay increases for our troops, and upgrades missile defense systems to protect against rogue nations like North Korea and Iran.  While many in Congress forget the needs of their districts, I’ve fought to keep our rural health clinics funded, and I’ve continued my efforts to expand benefits and services for veterans. 1 also voted to fund the Children’s Health Insurance Program for an additional ten years because it protects our most vulnerable population. If you’d like to learn more, please visit my website at joinpaulcook.com.  s/ Paul Cook	STATEMENT OF CANDIDATE FOR U.S. REPRESENTATIVE, 8TH DISTRICT  RITA RAMIREZ  Occupation: Retired College Professor  Education and Qualifications: 1, Dr. Rita Ramirez, am running to stand up to fight for you. 1 support American values. As an American, my loyalty is not based on the color of my skin, but the love in my heart for our country. We are all Americans, for USA means US - ALL.  Third-generation Californian, San Bernardino County family residence since 1900.  Degrees: BA, MA, ED.S, and PH.D.  Public School, Community College, and University Educator (38 years).  University Formal Education (12 years); Community College Trustee (6 years).  Area F Director San Bernardino County School Boards Association (4 years).  CA Teacher Association (Retired).  Vice Chair Region 8 San Bernardino County State Chicano Latino Caucus.  1 Support:  Education: public school (no vouchers}, curriculum studies Pre-K through 4th grade, 9-12th grade Career Academies; free community college; build a High Desert and Morongo Basin University.  Seniors: restore Social Security benefits; Medicare for all; full-service hospital for High Desert; mobilized healthcare for Inyo and Mono counties; senior subsidized housing.  Veterans: guaranteed education and housing; 24/7 healthcare at any hospital.  Civil rights: life matters, women’s rights matter; LGBTQ rights matter; citizenship for DACA and immigration reform.  Gun control regulations changes; Amend tax reform.  Environment: support desert preservation, Climate Change, clean air and water; resolve Cadiz and Nestle water issues; against fracking in national parks; protect Mother Earth for Native Americans and all cultures.  Foreign Policy: Against outsourcing American jobs. No American in harm’s way.  People Over Politics. Your Values, Your Voice, Your Vote for Dr. Rita Ramirez  s/ Rita Ramirez
STATEMENT OF CANDIDATE FOR U.S. REPRESENTATIVE, 8TH DISTRICT  MARJORIE “MARGE” DOYLE AGE: 61 Occupation: Registered Nurse Executive  Education and Qualifications: Marge Doyle is a native Californian, a registered nurse with nearly 4 decades as a leader in the healthcare industry and a social justice advocate who is passionate about protecting the people and the irreplaceable natural resources in her district. As an elected official to the Morongo Basin Healthcare District Marge worked across party lines and saved the only rural hospital in her home town from closing along with 600 associated jobs and averted bankruptcy moving to financial stability with $15 million in reserves. All of this was accomplished in three years. Marge is running for congress to represent the residents in the 8th District. She will work for practical and sustainable solutions to ensure everyone has access to healthcare, protect our precious and irreplaceable public lands from drilling, draining and mining because they are directly tied to jobs and a sustainable economy in our district; protect Social Security and Medicare which every working person paid into; ensure that those who served- our veterans receive the benefits and health care they were promised and work for a viable immigration policy that does not destroy families and communities. Marge has served as president and board member of the Morongo Basin Health District. She is also the treasurer of the Greater Yucca Valley Kiwanis, a member of Metropolitan Community Church and lives in Joshua Tree, California.  s/ Marjorie “Marge” Doyle	STATEMENT OF CANDIDATE FOR U.S. REPRESENTATIVE, 8TH DISTRICT  TIM DONNELLY  Education and Qualifications: I’m NOT a politician. I’m a Patriot, an ordinary citizen—who prior to ever holding elected office—stood up on the border as a Minuteman leader against an out-of-control Federal government, and demanded they do their job and secure the border.  Congress is full of do-nothing politicians who think Government is the solution to every problem. But you and 1 know that Government itself is often the problem.  We deserve a representative who will fight to reform the VA, until at the very least, our veterans are treated better than illegal aliens—instead of just talking about it. There’s no excuse for any representative from the 8th Congressional District, with our strong military heritage to vote to use our military funds for sex-change surgeries.  We deserve much better! If elected, 1 will work to:  1)	Put a District office in Bishop to give a voice to Inyo & Mono Counties—whose land is almost completely under the control of a far-distant, Federal Government.  2)	Build the Wall. Defund Sanctuary Cities. Enforce all immigration laws. No amnesty, period.  3)	Reform the VA so that we treat our Veterans with the dignity and respect they deserve.  4)	Defend our 2nd Amendment without apology.  5)	Oppose all new Taxes, Fees, Entitlements and Expansions of Government. Period.  6)	End Common Core, Restore Local Control.  7)	Repeal ObamaCare. Oppose unconstitutional EPA, BLM and other Federal Land Grabs.  Endorsed by Real People, not Politicians!

Anna and 1 are blessed with two young boys, but today’s California is far different from what we experienced and now 1 am fighting for a better tomorrow.

As County Supervisor, 1 have balanced multi-billion dollar budgets, increased deputy patrols, fought bureaucratic waste, protected seniors and veterans from scammers, and helped employers create good jobs in our community.  Count on me to fight against tax hikes, protect Proposition 13 and work to repeal the unfair gas tax.  1 will work to bring better paying jobs to Mono County and support the tourism and ski industries.  You can also count on me to provide firefighters with the support they need to protect Mono County homes and businesses.  1 will help law enforcement solve more crimes by reinstating DNA collection of convicts. Also, 1 will fight for victims’ rights and keep our communities safe by outlawing the early release of child sex traffickers and predators.  As a teacher with over a decade of classroom experience, 1 support K-12 education reforms, increased vocational training and promoting greater local academic control.  Assemblyman Frank Bigelow, County Sheriffs and Deputies, the Peace Officers Research Association of California, teachers, veterans, farmers and small business owners support my candidacy. 1 hope you will too.

STATEMENT OF CANDIDATE FOR STATE SENATE, 8TH DISTRICT  MARK BELDEN  Education and Qualifications: 1 am a candidate for the State Legislature because 1 understand the particular rural needs of our area of California. 1 will support legislation and policies that better suit the needs of my constituents with common sense legislation.  Our elected representatives must be the voice of the people, not political parties or special interest groups whose sole purpose is to expand their ideology. Making public policy is not easy. It should not be. It should take into consideration the desires of all constituents as best as possible.  Like many of you, 1 am committed to reducing government waste, stretching each tax dollar further than it has ever been before. As a steward of the people’s money we must not foolishly spend more than we take in and always be aware that every penny misspent will affect our future. That future is the one our children will inherit.  1 will also be a strong and proud leader of personal freedoms and rights. Your freedom to choose religion, education, sexual orientation, marriage, women’s choice or the right to bear firearms will always be paramount. We must not allow our rights to be diminished in any way.  My victory as a no party preference legislator will be the first in California’s history and a victory for the voters who support me in representing the Foothills District. We, as a legislative district, will undoubtedly be looked upon as leaders and pioneers of future public policy.

First elected in 1998 to my local school board in Southern California, 1 currently serve on the Vallecito Union School Board in Calaveras County.

Having helped to start a small family company, 1 understand the issues facing the business community. Currently 1 am fighting to secure homeowners insurance for Sierra Foothill residents who continue to lose coverage because of wildfires.

I’m proud of the work we’ve done together, but the fight is far from over.  As a volunteer firefighter, 1 will continue to advocate for firefighters, ensuring they have the necessary tools to protect us from catastrophic wildfires. We must implement better forest management practices, and cleanup overgrown forests to prevent devastating wildfires. When government bureaucrats jeopardized funding for clean water projects, 1 reminded them our community voted to fund surface storage, and we cannot allow these projects to sit idle. 1 won’t back down until we break ground on vital reservoir projects that will create jobs and help us deliver a clean and reliable water supply to our neighbors.  1 was proud to help lead the fight against the $52 million gas tax increase. We already give Sacramento too much of our hard-earned money. Families and farmers in our region simply cannot afford higher taxes and vehicle registration fees.  With California’s universities and colleges becoming more expensive and competitive, 1 will continue to be a strong voice for career technical education programs in our schools, to prepare our students for tomorrow’s competitive and changing economy.  Lastly, with your support 1 will build upon my record of supporting economic policies that help create local jobs and build a stronger economy.  1 would be humbled to continue serving as your voice in Sacramento and honored to have your vote.  www.frankbigelow.com  s/ Frank Bigelow

ERIC KAUFMAN

Education and Qualifications: I’m running for Supervisor to put the people
of Mammoth Lakes first.

As a first responder, Navy veteran, business leader, MCWD Board Director,
and most importantly husband and father, I’m proud to serve you in public
office and I hope I can earn your vote for Supervisor.

My top initiatives are straightforward and realistic: affordable childcare
options for working parents, a reliable 911 system that doesn’t repeatedly
go offline, and implementing a fiscally responsible merit-based home
ownership program for community members.

Our local government, some of whom are resort owners and Alterra
executives, champions Mammoth as a “resort town”, always seeming
unable to help the people who live here and make Mammoth work.

With all the hurdles our residents face, county government is opting to spend
millions of dollars (with interest) for its new Mammoth office space. The
message is sadly clear: there’s money for new government digs but none for
what kids, working families, and retirees need.

I hope you’ll join me with not only your vote, but also your civic engagement.
We have a unique opportunity to take control of our government and make
Mammoth the town we want it to be. I look forward to serving you.

local government, including my role as Chairperson for the Recreation
Commission in Escondido, CA. During my time on the commission, we were
tasked to make the Recreation Department self-sustaining, and did so within

of Escondido.

While living in Mammoth Lakes, I’ve served on the Grand Jury, am currently

Education and Qualifications: As the current Mayor of Mammoth Lakes
and a member of the Town Council, I am running for a second term to
build on the momentum of current Town accomplishments and to put the
interests of our community first. The “Community Housing Action Plan” and
the Town’s purchase of the Shady Rest Parcel for community housing must
be top priorities. Implementation of the “Walk Bike Ride” and “Downtown
Revitalization” programs are important opportunities for our community as
well.

The strength of the Mammoth Lakes community lies in our willingness to
work hard and contribute our talents to a larger good. Working hard and
working together makes it possible to live, recreate, and raise families in this
wonderful place.

While California’s larger cities can absorb government missteps, small towns
like Mammoth Lakes cannot afford to make mistakes that waste valuable tax
dollars and undermine community confidence. I support Mammoth Lakes
Tourism, Mammoth Lakes Recreation, and Mammoth Lakes Housing as
examples of the kinds of innovative tools our community needs to succeed.

I am committed to ensuring that our government is an efficient and effective
partner to all, and the steward of a strong, stable local economy. I ask for

Education and Qualifications: Mammoth has been my home since 1996
when I moved here as a single mother with my two small children. For 20
years I served as the Public Health Director, spent four years as the EMS
Director and survived two tenures as the interim County Administrative
Officer. I’ve been on the Southern Mono Healthcare District Board since
1997 and currently serve as Chair. I was also a TOML Mobility Commission
member.

My experience here has taught me how hard it is to be a local, find housing,
balance family and career, make a living wage, and still have time to enjoy
living here. I have watched and learned from Town Council over the years,
and now I want to help make the important decisions that will impact our
future.

Town Council must make decisions that are fiscally responsible, adhering to
budget realities and investing in capital projects that are in the best interests
of all. One of the challenges facing us is housing which requires smart ideas,
wise partnerships and open public processes to help solve this issue. We
can’t be a community if we can’t live here.

KIRKSTAPP

Occupation: Retired Teacher

Education and Qualifications: In the midst of another drought year,
Mammoth Mountain has done an amazing job of making snow and
manicuring runs. The skiing and snowboarding has been terrific.

According to an article in Power Magazine, it’s more than a drought,
climate change is impacting the ski industry and mountain communities. The
economic impacts could be grim.

I am not implying that Mammoth hunker down in the face of climate
change, what I am suggesting is that we continue to focus on being a year-
round resort, marketing winter, summer, spring, and fall, promoting events
and activities, while whittling down our carbon footprint.

Also, key to Mammoth’s success as a resort community is its
workforce. The challenge, however, is providing affordable workforce
housing. Without workers—maids, landscapers, waiters and waitresses,
teachers and bus drivers, lawyers and police officers, Mammoth ceases to
be a viable community.

Mammoth has been my home for 44 years. I’m passionate about this
place and the people who live, work and visit our community.

I have the commitment and the common sense to rationally address
Mammoth’s challenges and fairly represent the diverse interests within our
community. I ask for your support and your vote.

esqui y en las comunidades montanesas. El impacto a la economia podria
ser nefasto.

No estoy diciendo que Mammoth no haga nada frente al cambio
climatico, lo que estoy sugiriendo es que, al tiempo que reducimos nuestra
huella de carbono, sigamos enfocandonos en ser un centro vacacional todo
el ano, promocionando el invierno, el verano, la primavera y el otono, y
promoviendo eventos y actividades.

Ademas, la calve del exito de Mammoth como centro vacacional
es su fuerza de trabajo. Sin embargo, el desaffo es proporcionar viviendas
accesibles a los trabajadores. Sin todas las sirvientas, jardineros, meseros,
maestros, conductores de autobuses, abogados y oficiales de politia,
Mammoth dejaria de ser una comunidad viable.

Mammoth ha sido mi hogar por 44 anos. Me apasiona este lugar y las
personas que viven, trabajan y visitan nuestra comunidad.

Tengo el compromiso y el sentido comun de abordar de manera
rational los desafios de Mammoth y representar con justicia los diversos
intereses dentro de nuestra comunidad. Le pido que me apoye y vote por mi.

Education and Qualifications: I’m running for Town Council because I want
to be the voice for the people. As a former Congressional Intern and former
Mammoth Lakes Recreation employee I’ve learned the value in representing
the public.

I believe in continuing to build the community of Mammoth Lakes: We
need affordable housing, diverse economic opportunities, arts, culture and
recreation, and to keep developing policies and procedures that bring people
together. When we come together, beautiful ideas and plans emerge, we look
after one another, and realize the true strength of Mammoth Lakes comes
from us, and the work we all do to create a thriving community.

In my seven years living here, I have experienced the same struggles with
housing and employment that many residents face and been inspired by the
hard work and dedication of the community.

I have been your barista, ski instructor, local journalist, film festival manager,
your local actress, the host at The Fort co-working space, and the woman
taking business calls on the chair lift. And now I hope for your support.

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL
MEASURE A
MAMMOTH LAKES FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT

California Government Code section 53978 authorizes any local agency
providing fire protection services to propose, by ordinance, a special tax for
fire protection services provided by the local agency. Pursuant to this authority,
the governing body of the Mammoth Lakes fire Protection District proposes,
through “Measure A,” to impose a special tax on real property located within
the Mammoth Lakes Fire Protection District. The tax will take effect only if it is
approved by two-thirds of the District voters voting on the matter.

Measure A would impose a flat parcel tax of $79.00 on all taxable parcels
located within the Mammoth Lakes Fire Protection District.

The special tax would be levied once during the 2018-19 fiscal year at flat
rates based on the use of each taxable parcel of real-property, and then levied
once during each fiscal year thereafter with percentage adjustments (either
increasing or decreasing the amount of the tax) based on the percentage
change (if any) during the preceding 12-month period in the Consumer Price
Index of the Bureau ot Labor Statistics, United States Department of Labor.

A “Yes” vote on Measure A approves the proposed special tax on all taxable
parcels within the Mammoth Lakes Fire Protection District for fire protection
services.

A “No” vote on Measure A disapproves the proposed special tax on all taxable
parcels within the Mammoth Lakes Fire Protection District for fire protection
services.

“Argument in Favor of Measure A”

“A yes vote on Measure A will generate funds that shall be used for the
recruitment, retention, and training of our part-time firefighters and limited
full-time staff, and the expansion of services to create a more fire-resistant
community. The funds will support a sustainable and appropriate level of
emergency response to fires, rescues, medical emergencies, hazardous
materials, and other kinds of emergencies your Fire District is asked to respond
to. The wildfire threat is accelerating through the recent death of many trees
in and around the Fire District. The funds will support efforts to prevent, and
reduce the damages of, wildfires and structure fires in your Fire District. The
funds will also support completion of the significant training requirements
placed on firefighters (full-time and part-time). The best chance the Fire District
has to improve the outcome of an emergency is when it can respond quickly
and with enough people that have the right equipment and are well trained in
using the equipment. The funds provided through a yes vote on Measure A will
support the Fire District’s ability to improve outcomes.”

“Measure B.”

Mammoth Unified School District (the “District”) voting on the proposition, the
District shall be authorized to issue and sell bonds of up to $63,100,000 in

Sate principal amount to provide financing for the specific school facilities

!‘Bond Project List”), and qualify to receive State of California matching grant
funds, subject to all of the accountability safeguards specified below.

ACCOUNTABILITY SAFEGUARDS

The provisions in this section are specifically included in this proposition
in order that the voters and taxpayers of the District may be assured that
their money will be spent to address specific school facilities needs of the
District, all in compliance with the requirements of Article XIIIA, Section 1(b)
(3) of the California Constitution, and tne Strict Accountability in Local School
Construction Bonds Act of 2000 (codified at Sections 15264 and following of
the California Education Code (the “Education Code”)).

Evaluation of Needs. The Board of Education of the District (the
“Board”) has prepared an updated facilities master plan in order to evaluate
and address all of the facilities needs of the District at each campus and facility,
and to determine which projects to finance from a local bond at this time. The
Board hereby certifies that it has evaluated safety, class size reduction and
information technology needs in developing the Bond Project List.

Limitations on Use of Bonds. Proceeds from the sale of bonds
authorized by this proposition shall be used only for the construction,
reconstruction, rehabilitation, or replacement of school facilities, including the
furnishing and equipping of school facilities, or the acquisition or lease of real
property for school facilities, and not for any other purpose, including teacher
and administrator salaries and other school operating expenses.

Independent Citizens’ Oversight Committee. The Board shall establish
an independent citizens’ oversight committee (pursuant to Education Code
Section 15278 and following), to ensure bond proceeds are expended only for
the school facilities projects listed in the Bond Project List. The committee shall
be established within 60 days of the date that tne Board enters the election
results on its minutes pursuant to Section 15274 of the Education Code. In
accordance with Section 15282 of the Education Code, the citizens’ oversight

organization. No employee or official of the District and no vendor, contractor or
consultant of the District shall be appointed to the citizens’ oversight committee.

Annual Performance Audits. The Board shall conduct an annual,
independent performance audit to ensure that the bond proceeds have been
expended only on the school facilities projects listed in the Bond Project
List. These audits shall be conducted in accordance with the Government
Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States for
performance audits. The results of these audits shall be made publicly available
and shall be submitted to the citizens’ oversight committee in accordance with
Section 15286 of the Education Code.

Annual Financial Audits. The Board shall conduct an annual,
independent financial audit of the bond proceeds until all of those proceeds
have been spent for the school facilities projects listed in the Bond Project List.
These audits shall be conducted in accordance with the Government Auditing
Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States for financial
audits. The results of these audits shall be made publicly available and shall
be submitted to the citizens’ oversight committee in accordance with Section
15286 of the Education Code.

Special Bond Proceeds Account: Annual Report to Board. Upon
approval of this proposition and the sale of any bonds approved, the Board
snail take actions necessary to establish an account in which proceeds of the
sale of bonds will be deposited. As long as any proceeds of the bonds remain
unexpended, the Superintendent of the District shall cause a report to be filed
with the Board no later than January 1 of each year, commencing on the first
January 1 after the sale of the first series of bonds, stating (a) the amount
of bond proceeds received and expended in that year, and (b) the status of
any project funded or to be funded from bond proceeds. The report may relate
to the calendar year, fiscal year, or other appropriate annual period as the
Superintendent of the District shall determine, and may be incorporated into
the annual budget, audit, or other appropriate routine report to the Board.

FURTHER SPECIFICATIONS

Joint-Use Projects. The District may enter into agreements with other
public agencies or nonprofit organizations for joint use of school facilities
financed with the proceeds of the bonds in accordance with Education
Code Section 17077.42 (or any successor provision). The District may seek
State grant funds for eligible joint-use projects as permitted by law, and this
proposition hereby specifies and acknowledges that bond funds will or may be
used to fund all or a portion of the local share for any eligible joint-use projects
identified in the Bond Project List or as otherwise permitted by California State
regulations, as the Board shall determine.

Single Purpose. All of the purposes enumerated in this proposition shall
be united and voted upon as one single proposition, pursuant to Education Code
Section 15100, and all the enumerated purposes shall constitute the specific
single purpose of the bonds, and proceeds of the bonds shall be spent only for
such purpose, pursuant to California Government Code Section 53410.

Other Terms of the Bonds. When sold, the bonds shall bear interest at
an annual rate not exceeding the statutory maximum, and that interest shall be
made payable at the time or times permitted by law. The bonds may be issued
and sold in several series, and no bond shall be made to mature more than the
statutory maximum number of years from the date borne by that bond.

ESTIMATED BALLOT INFORMATION

The District is required by law to include in the statement of the measure
to be voted on estimates of the amount of money to be raised annually to repay
the bonds and the rate and duration of the tax to be levied for the bonds. As of
the time this proposition was placed on the ballot, the District estimated that
amounts to be raised annually would average $3,675,000 for the repayment of
the authorized bonds for approximately 33 years at projected tax rates of 4 to 6
cents per $100 of assessed valuation. Attention of all voters is directed to the
fact that such information is based upon the District’s projections and estimates
only, which are not binding upon the District. The amount of money to be raised
annually and the rate and duration of the tax to be levied for the bonds may vary
from those presently estimated due to variations from these estimates in the
timing of bond sales, the amount of bonds sold and market interest rates at the
time of each sale, and actual assessed valuations over the term of repayment
of the bonds. The dates of sale and the amount of bonds sold at any given
time will be determined by the District based on need for construction funds
and other factors. The actual interest rates at which the bonds will be sold will
depend on the bond market at the time of each sale. Actual future assessed
valuation will depend upon the amount and value of taxable property within the
District as determined by the County Assessor in the annual assessment and
the equalization process.

BOND PROJECT LIST

The Bond Project List below lists the specific projects the District
proposes to finance with proceeds of the bonds. The Bond Project List shall
be considered a part of the bond proposition and shall be reproduced in any
official document required to contain tne full statement of the bond proposition.
Listed projects will be completed as needed at a particular school or facility
site according to Board-established priorities, ana the order in which sucn
projects appear on the Bond Project List is not an indication of priority for
funding or completion. Any authorized repairs shall be capital expenditures. The
Bond Project List does not authorize non-capital expenditures. Each project
is assumed to include its share of costs of the election and bond issuance,
construction-related costs, such as project and construction management,
architectural, engineering, inspection and similar planning and testing costs,
demolition and interim nousing costs, legal, accounting and similar fees,
costs related to the independent annual financial and performance audits, a
contingency for unforeseen design and construction costs, and other costs
incidental to or necessary for completion of the listed projects (whether the
related work is performed by the District or third parties). The final cost of each
project will be determined as plans are finalized, construction bids are awarded,
and projects are completed. In addition, certain construction funds expected
from non-bond sources, including State of California grant funds for eligible
projects, have not yet been secured. Therefore, the Board cannot guarantee that
the bonds will provide sufficient funds to allow completion of all fisted projects.
Alternatively, if the District obtains unexpected funds from non-bond sources
with respect to listed projects, such projects may be enhanced, supplemented
or expanded to the extent of such funds. Some projects may be subject to
further government approvals, including by State officials and boards and/
or local environmental or agency approval. Inclusion of a project on the Bond
Project List is not a guarantee that the project will be completed (regardless of
whether bond funds are available).

The specific projects authorized to be financed with proceeds of the bonds
under this proposition are as follows:

reconoce que los fondos de los bonos se usaran o podran usarse para financiar
todo o parte de la participation local para cualquier proyecto de uso conjunto
identificado en la Lista de proyectos con bonos, o que este permitido de otro
modo en virtud de las regulaciones del estado de California, segun lo determine
la Junta.

Proposito unico. Todos los propositos enunciados en esta propuesta se uniran
y se someteran a votacion como una sola propuesta en virtud de la Seccion
15100 del Codigo de Educacion, y todas las propuestas enunciadas constituiran
un proposito unico especifico para los bonos, y los ingresos de los bonos se
aastaran unicamente para dichos propositos, en virtud de la Seccion 53410 del
Codigo de Educacion.

Otros terminos de los bonos. Al venderse, los bonos deberan generar
intereses con una tasa anual que no supere el maximo establecido, y dichos
intereses seran pagaderos en el momento o momentos permitido(s) por la ley.
Los bonos se podran emitir en varias series y ningun bono debera emitirse con
un vencimiento que supere el maximo numero de anos permitido a partir de la
fecha indicada en ese bono.

INFORMACltiN CALCULADA EN LA BOLETA ELECTORAL

El Distrito esta obligado por ley a incluir en la declaration de la iniciativa
de ley sobre la que se hara la votacion, las estimaciones de la cantidad de
dinero que se reunira anualmente para pagar los bonos v la tasa y duration
del impuesto que se recaudara sobre los bonos. Desde la fecha en la que esta
propuesta se incluyo en la boleta electoral, el Distrito calculo que las cantidades
ue se recaudarian anualmente serian $3,675,000 en promedio para el pago
e los bonos autorizados durante aproximadamente 33 anos con las tasas
impositivas proyectadas de 4 a 6 centavos por cada $100 de avaluo catastral.
Se llama la atencion de todos los electores sobre el hecho de que dicha
information se basa solo en proyecciones y calculos del distrito, los cuales no
son vinculantes para este. La cantidad de dinero que se recaudaria anualmente
y la tasa y duration del impuesto a recaudarse sobre los bonos pueden variar
de los calculados actualmente debido a variaciones de estos calculos en el
momento de la venta de los bonos, la cantidad de bonos vendidos y las tasas de
interes del mercado al momento de cada venta, y los avaluos catastrales reales
durante el periodo de pago de los bonos. Las fechas de venta y el monto de
bonos vendidos en cualquier momento seran determinados por el Distrito con
base en la necesidad de fondos para la construccion y otros factores. Las tasas
de interes reales a las que los bonos se venderan dependeran del mercado de
bonos al momento de cada venta. El futuro avaluo catastral real dependera del
monto y del valor de la propiedad sujeta a impuestos dentro del Distrito, segun
lo determine el tasador del condado en la evaluation anual y el proceso de
igualacion.

LISTA DE PROYECTOS CON BONOS

La Lista de proyectos con bonos que aparece a continuation
menciona especificamente los proyectos que el Distrito propone financiar
con los ingresos de los bonos. La Lista de proyectos con bonos debe
considerarse parte de la propuesta de bonos y debera incluirse en cualquier
documento oficial que este obligado a contener la declaration completa
de la propuesta de bonos. Los proyectos incluidos en la lista se concluiran
segun sea necesario en una escuela o lugar de las instalaciones particulares
de acuerdo con las prioridades establecidas por la Junta, y el orden en el
que dichos proyectos aparecen en la Lista de proyectos con bonos no es un
indicador de la prioridad para recibirfinanciamiento o concluirse. Cualquier
reparacion autorizada seran gastos de capital. La Lista de proyectos con
bonos no autoriza gastos que no sean de capital. Se asume que cada
proyecto incluye su participation de costos de la election y emision de
bonos; los costos relacionados con la construccion, como gestion de proyecto
y de construccion; los costos de arquitectura, ingenieria, inspection u
otros costos similares de planificacion y prueba; los costos de demolicion
y vivienda provisional, los honorarios legales, de contabilidad y otros
honorarios similares; los costos relacionados con las auditorias anuales
independientes financieras y de desempeno; los costos de contingencia de
diseno y construccion no previstos, y otros costos incidentales o necesarios
para la finalization de los proyectos incluidos en la lista (ya sea que el
trabajo relacionado lo realice el Distrito o terceros). El costo final de cada
proyecto se determinara a medida que se finalicen los planes, se concedan
los contratos de construccion y se completen los proyectos. Adicionalmente,
determinados fondos de construccion que se espera recibir de fuentes que no
estan relacionadas con los bonos, incluidos los fondos de subvenciones del
estado de California para proyectos elegibles, aun no estan garantizados. Por
lo tanto, la Junta no puede garantizar que los bonos proporcionaran fondos
suficientes para permitir la conclusion de todos los proyectos de la lista. De
manera alternativa, si el Distrito obtiene fondos inesperados de fuentes que no
sean los bonos con respecto a los proyectos de la lista, dichos proyectos se
pueden mejorar, complementar o ampliar en la medida en que dichos fondos
lo permitan. Es posible que algunos proyectos esten sujetos a la aprobacion
del gobierno, incluida la otorgada por funcionarios y juntas estatales o a
la aprobacion medioambiental o de agencias locales. La inclusion de un
proyecto en la Lista de proyectos con bonos no es garantia de que el proyecto
sera contemplado (independientemente de si existen fondos de los bonos
disponibles o no).

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL
BOND MEASURE B
MAMMOTH UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT

Measure B is proposed by the Board of Education (“Board”) of the Mammoth
Unified School District (“District”). Pursuant to the California Constitution and
Education Code section 15266, a school district may issue general obligation
bonds if approved by 55% (or more) of the voters of the District. This measure
would authorize the District to issue and sell bonds up to $63,100,000 in

Raate principal amount to provide financing for specific school facilities
s listed on the BOND PROJECT LIST in the measure. It would also qualify
istrict to receive State matching funds, subject to the accountability
safeguards specified in the measure. The Board has certified that it has
evaluated the safety, class size reduction and information technology needs of
the District in developing the Bond Project List.

The proceeds from these bonds may be used only for the construction,
reconstruction, rehabilitation, or replacement of school facilities, including the
furnishing and equipping of school facilities, or the acquisition or lease of real
property for school facilities, and not for any other purpose, including teacher
and employee salaries and other school operating expenses. Approval of the
bond measure does not guarantee that bonds will provide sufficient funds to
allow completion of all listed projects and inclusion of a project on the Bond
Project List is not a guarantee that the project will be completed (regardless of
whether bond funds are available).

By law the Board must establish an independent citizens’ oversight committee
to ensure that bond proceeds are properly expended for items in the Bond
Project List. In addition, the Board must conduct annual, independent financial
audits of the bond proceeds until all proceeds have been spent for the projects
listed on the Bond Project List.

If the bonds are approved, the District expects to issue the bonds in multiple
series over time. Principal and interest on the bonds will be payable from the
proceeds of tax levies on taxable real property in the District. These taxes
would be in addition to the normal property taxes levied on taxpayers in the
District. The amount of the increased taxes each year will depend upon the
amount needed to pay the principal and interest on the bonds.

According to the Tax Rate Statement, the District estimates that the average
annual tax rate that would be levied to fund this bond issue over the duration
of the bond debt service is 5.434 cents per $100 ($54.34 per $100,000)
of assessed valuation. The District estimates that the highest tax rate that
would be levied to fund this bond issue is 6.000 cents per $100 ($60.00 per
$100,000) of assessed valuation in fiscal year 2026-27. These estimates and
the years in which they apply may vary from those currently estimated due to
the variations in the timing of bona sales, the amount of bonds sold and market
interest rates at the time of each sale, and actual assessed valuations over the
repayment term.

A “Yes” vote would permit the Board to issue bonds in an amount not to exceed
$63,100,000 to provide financing for the specific school facilities projects listed
in the Bond Project List included in the measure.

A “No” vote would not permit the Board to issue bonds in an amount not to
exceed $63,100,000 to provide financing for the specific school facilities
projects listed in the Bond Project List included in the measure.

ANALISIS IMPARCIAL DEL ABOGADO DEL CONDADO
INICIATIVA DE LEY DE BONOS B
DISTRITO ESCOLAR UNIFICADO DE MAMMOTH

La Iniciativa de ley B es una propuesta de la Junta de Educacion (la “Junta”)
del Distrito Escolar Unificado de Mammoth (el “Distrito”). De acuerdo con la
Constitution de California y la section 15266 del Codigo de Educacion, un distrito
escolar puede emitir bonos de obligation general con la aprobacion del 55 %
(o mas) de los electores del Distrito. Esta iniciativa de ley autorizaria al Distrito
a emitir y vender bonos por hasta $63,100,000 en suma total de capital para
proporcionar financiamiento para los proyectos especificos en instalaciones
escolares que se senalan en la LISTA DE PROYECTOS CON BONOS dentro de la
iniciativa de ley. Tambien permitiria al Distrito recibir fondos de contrapartida
estatales, suieto a las salvaguardas de responsabilidad que se especifican en
la iniciativa de ley. La Junta certified que evaluo la seguridad, la reduction del
tamano de los grupos,y las necesidaaes de tecnologia informatica del Distrito
en el desarrollo de la Lista de proyectos con bonos.

Los ingresos provenientes de estos bonos se podran utilizar unicamente para la
construction, la reconstruction, la rehabilitation o el reemplazo de instalaciones
escolares, incluidos el mobiliario y el equipo de las instalaciones escolares o la
adquisicion o arrendamiento de bienes inmuebles para instalaciones escolares,
y no deberan utilizarse para ningun otro proposito, incluidos los salarios de
los maestros y de los empleados y otros gastos operativos escolares. La
aprobacion de la iniciativa de ley no garantiza que los bonos proporcionen
fondos suficientes para permitir la conclusion de todos los proyectos de la lista
y la inclusion de un proyecto en la Lista de proyectos con bonos no garantiza
que el proyecto vaya a ser contemplado (independientemente de que se tengan
o no disponibles fondos de los bonos).

Por ley, la Junta debe establecer un comite de supervision ciudadana
independiente para garantizar que los ingresos de los bonos se gasten
adecuadamente en los puntos incluidos enla Lista de proyectos con bonos.
Adicionalmente, la Junta debera realizar cada ano auditorias financieras
independientes de los ingresos provenientes de los bonos hasta que todos los
ingresos se hayan gastado en los proyectos que se mencionan en la Lista de
proyectos con bonos.

Si se aprueban los bonos, el Distrito espera emitir los bonos en series multiples
con el tiempo. El capital y los intereses de los bonos se pagaran con los
ingresos provenientes de la recaudacion de impuestos sobre las propiedades
sujetas a impuestos ubicadas en el Distrito. Estos impuestos serian adicionales
a los impuestos sobre la propiedad que ya se recaudan de los contribuyentes
del Distrito. El monto de los impuestos que aumenten cada ano dependera del
monto que se necesite para pagar el capital y los intereses de los bonos.

De acuerdo con la Declaration de la tasa impositiva, el Distrito estima que la
tasa impositiva anual que se recaudaria para financiar la emision de este bono
durante el periodo de duration del servicio de la deuda del bono es de 5.434
centavos por cada $100 ($54.34 por cada $100,000) de avaluo catastral. El
Distrito estima que la maxima tasa impositiva que se recaudaria para la emision
de este bono es de 6.000 centavos por cada $100 ($60.00 por cada $100,000)
de avaluo catastral durante el ano fiscal 2026-2027. Estas estimaciones y los
anos en los que se aplican pueden variar de los calculados actualmente, debido
a las variaciones en el momento de la venta de los bonos, la cantidad de bonos
vendidos y las tasas de interns del mercado al momento de cada venta y los
avaluos catastrales reales durante el periodo de pago de los bonos.

Un voto “Si” permitiria a la Junta emitir bonos por una cantidad que no exceda
los $63,100,000, para proporcionar financiamiento para los proyectos de
instalaciones escolares especificos que se mencionan en la Lista de proyectos
con bonos incluida en la iniciativa de ley.

Un voto “No” no permitiria a la Junta emitir bonos por una cantidad que no
exceda los $63,100,000, para proporcionar financiamiento para los proyectos
de instalaciones escolares especificos que se mencionan en la Lista de
proyectos con bonos incluida en la iniciativa de ley.

TAX INFORMATION STATEMENT

An election will be held in the Mammoth Unified School District (the
“District”) on June 5,2018, to authorize the sale of up to $63,100,000 in bonds
of the District to finance school facilities as described in the proposition. If the
bonds are approved, the District expects to issue the bonds in multiple series
overtime. Principal and interest on the bonds will be payable from the proceeds
of tax levies made upon the taxable property in the District. The following
information is provided in compliance with Sections 9400 through 9405 of the
California Elections Code.

1.	The best estimate of the average annual tax rate that would be
required to be levied to fund this bond issue over the entire
duration of the bond debt service, based on assessed valuations
available at the time of filing of this statement, is 5.434 cents
per $100 ($54.34 per $100,000) of assessed valuation. The final
fiscal year in which the tax to be levied to fund this bond issue is
anticipated to be collected is fiscal year 2050-2051.

2.	The best estimate of the highest tax rate that would be required
to be levied to fund this bond issue, based on estimated assessed
valuations available at the time of filing of this statement, is 6.000
cents per $100 ($60.00 per $100,000) of assessed valuation in
fiscal year 2026-27.

3.	The best estimate of the total debt service, including the principal
and interest, that would be required to be repaid if all of the bonds
are issued and sold is approximately $121,288,059.

Voters should note that estimated tax rates are based on the ASSESSED
VALUE of taxable properly on the County’s official tax rolls, Mon the property’s
market value, which could be more or less than the assessed value. In addition,
taxpayers eligible for a property tax exemption, such as the homeowner’s
exemption, will be taxed at a lower effective tax rate than described above.
Certain taxpayers may also be eligible to postpone payment of taxes. Property
owners should consult their own property tax bills and tax advisors to determine
their property’s assessed value and any applicable tax exemptions.

Attention of all voters is directed to the fact that the foregoing information
is based upon the District’s projections and estimates only, wnich are not
binding upon the District. The average annual tax rate, the highest tax rate and
the year or years in which it will apply, and the actual total debt service, may
vary from tnose presently estimated due to variations from these estimates
in the timing of bond sales, the amount of bonds sold and market interest
rates at the lime of each sale, and actual assessed valuations over the term of
repayment of the bonds. The dates of sale and the amount of bonds sold at any
given time will be determined by the District based on need for construction
funds and other factors, including the legal limitations on bonds approved by a
55% affirmative vote. The actual interest rates at which the bonds will be sold
will depend on the bond market at the time of each sale. Actual future assessed
valuation will depend upon the amount and value of taxable property within the
District as determined by the County Assessor in the annual assessment and
the equalization process.

DECLARACI6N DE INFORMACltiN TRIBUTARY

El 5 de junio de 2018, se llevara a cabo una election en el Distrito
Escolar Unificado de Mammoth (el “Distrito”) para autorizar la venta de hasta
$63,100,000 en bonos del Distrito para financiar las instalaciones escolares
que se describen en la propuesta. Si se aprueban los bonos, el Distrito espera
emitir los bonos en series multiples con el tiempo. El capital y los intereses
de los bonos se pagaran con los ingresos provenientes de la recaudacion de
impuestos hechos sobre las propiedades sujetas a impuestos ubicadas dentro
del Distrito. La siguiente informacion se proporciona en cumplimiento de las
secciones 9400 a 9405 del Codigo Electoral de California.

1.	El mejor calculo de la tasa impositiva promedio anual que se
requeriria gravar para financiar esta emision de bonos durante
toda la duration ael servicio de la deuda de los bonos, con base
en los avaluos catastrales disponibles al momenta de presentar
esta declaracion, es de 5.434 centavos por cada $100 ($54.34
por cada $100,000) de avaluo catastral. El ano fiscal en el que se
recaudaria el impuesto para financiar esta emision de bonos se
espera que sea durante la recaudacion del ano fiscal 2050-2051.

2.	El mejor calculo de la tasa impositiva mas alta que se requeriria
gravar para financiar esta emision de bonos, con base en los
avaluos catastrales calculados disponibles al momenta de
presentar esta declaracion, es de 6.000 centavos por cada $100
($60.00 por cada $100,000) de avaluo catastral durante el ano
fiscal 2026-2027.

3.	El mejor calculo del servicio de la deuda total, incluido el capital y
los intereses, que se requeriria pagar si todos los bonos se emiten
y se venden es de $121,288,059 aproximadamente.

Los electoral deben tomar en cuenta que el calculo de la tasa impositiva
se basa en el AVALUO CATASTRAL de las propiedades gravables de los registros
fiscales oficiales del condado, no en el valor de mercado de la propiedad, que
podrla ser mayor o menor que el avaluo catastral. Ademas, a los contribuyentes
elegibles para una exencion del impuesto sobre la propiedad, como la exencion
para propietarios, se les impondra una tasa impositiva efectiva menor de la
que se describio anteriormente. Algunos contribuyentes tambien podrlan ser
elegibles para posponer el pago de impuestos. Los propietarios de bienes
deben consultar sus propias facturas fiscales de bienes y a sus asesores
fiscales para determinar el avaluo catastral de sus bienes y cualquier exencion
fiscal aplicable.

Se llama la atencion de todos los electores sobre el hecho de que la
informacion anterior se basa solo en proyecciones y calculos del Distrito, los
cuales no son vinculantes para este. La tasa impositiva promedio, la maxima
tasa impositiva y el ano o anos en los que se aplicara, y el servicio de la deuda
total, pueden variar de los calculados actualmente, debido a variaciones de
estos calculos en el momenta de la venta de los bonos, la cantidad de bonos
vendidos y las tasas de interes del mercado al momenta de cada venta y
los avaluos catastrales reales durante el periodo de pago de los bonos. Las
fechas de venta y el monto de bonos vendidos en cualquier momenta seran
determinados por el distrito con base en la necesidaa de fondos para la
construction y otros factores, incluidas las limitaciones legales de los bonos
aprobados por un 55% de votos afirmativos. Las tasas de interes reales a las
que los bonos se venderan dependeran del mercado de bonos al momenta de
cada venta. El futuro avaluo catastral real dependera del monto y del valor de la
propiedad sujeta a impuestos dentro del Distrito, segun lo determine el tasador
del condado en la evaluation anual y el proceso de igualacion.

believes that the tax, as applied to him or her, is impermissible under applicable
law, he or she may request that the Tax Collector release him or her from the

gross receipts of the business) of persons engaged in cannabis businesses. In
conducting such investigation, the Tax Collector shall have the power to inspect

A.	The restoration of the rate of the tax to a rate that is no higher than that
set by this Chapter, if the Town Council has acted to reduce the rate of the tax;

section, subsection, sentence, clause and phrase thereof, irrespective of the
fact that any one or more sections, subsections, sentences, clauses, or phrases
be declared invalid.

SECTION 3. CEQA REQUIREMENTS. This Ordinance is exempt from review
under the California Environmental Quality Act, because it can be seen with
certainty that there is no possibility that the enactment of this Ordinance
would have a significant effect on the environment and because the Ordinance
involves the approval of government revenues to fund existing services. It does
not make any commercial activity lawful, nor commit the Town to funding any
particular activity.

It is hereby certified that this Ordinance was approved and adopted by the
People of the Town of Mammoth Lakes at the Town’s June 5, 2018 statewide
election.

TOWN ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE C

Measure C has been placed on the ballot by the Mammoth Lakes Town Council.
If approved by a majority of those voting, it would add a new Chapter 5.42
to tne Mammoth Lakes Municipal Code, pertaining to taxation of cannabis-
related businesses. Specifically, Measure C would establish initial tax rates
of 1% of gross receipts for cannabis testing laboratories; 2% of gross receipts
for businesses engaged in cannabis cultivation, distribution, manufacturing
processing, operation as a non-retail cannabis microbusiness, or any type of
cannabis Business not fitting into another category; and 4% of gross receipts
for businesses engaged in retail cannabis sales, either in a store or through
delivery to consumers, or operating as a retail sales microbusiness. Measure
C would specifically exempt from taxation personal cannabis cultivation that
complies with the limits set forth in state law.

Measure C would require the Town Council to review the tax rates annually. As
part of that review, Measure C would allow the Town Council to reduce these
tax rates to as low as 1%, or to increase the tax rates by no more than 1%
each year to a maximum of 8% for retail sales and 4% for all other cannabis
businesses. The revenues generated by Measure C could be used for any
general Town purpose, such as police, road maintenance, or recreation.

In addition to establishing tax rates. Measure C would adopt related regulatory
provisions as part of tne new Chapter 5.42. These include definitions,
requirements for the reporting and remission of the tax, penalties for late
payment, refunds for overpayments, authority for the Town to conduct audits
of cannabis businesses, ana an appeal procedure for cannabis businesses
regarding their tax assessments. Measure C would allow the Town Council
to amend any of its regulatory provisions, but any increases in the tax rates or
expansion of the tax would require future voter approval.

Argument in Favor of Measure C

On June 8, 2010, the voters of Mammoth Lakes approved Measure M, which
allowed for two medical marijuana cooperatives to operate within the Town of
Mammoth Lakes. Measure M did not include any provisions for the Town to
collect tax revenue on these businesses. The costs for the enforcement and
management of Measure M have been borne by incidental fees imposed by the
Town and by the taxpayers of Mammoth Lakes.

In 2016, the voters of the State of California approved Proposition 64, which
legalized marijuana for personal use, and in January 2018, Proposition 64
went into effect, allowing for the sale and taxation of recreational marijuana
throughout the State of California. The Town of Mammoth Lakes has approved
marijuana and cannabis regulations consistent with Proposition 64, but more
importantly, the Town’s regulations are consistent with the values, desires, and
needs of our community.

On February 21,2018, the Town Council voted unanimously to place “Measure
C: The Cannabis Business Tax Ordinance” on the June 5,2018 ballot to provide
Mammoth Lakes voters the opportunity to impose a gross receipts tax on
cannabis businesses that operate consistent with the Town’s new cannabis
regulations. With the voters’ approval, Measure C will be imposed on cannabis
business activities including retailing, wholesaling, cultivating, transporting
distributing, manufacturing, processing, packaging, delivering, and testing of
cannabis products for medical or recreational use.

Measure C will provide new revenue for the Town that can be used for any
legal municipal purpose, including public safety and law enforcement. It is
endorsed unanimously by the Town Council, members of the local marijuana
and cannabis industry, and will support and maintain essential services for our
Town. Please vote YES for Measure C: The Mammoth Lakes Cannabis Business
Tax Ordinance.

assessment pursuant to Section 3.30.240. The Clerk of the Board, or his or her

If a business subject to the tax is operating both within and outside
the unincorporated area of the County, it is the intent of the County to apply
the cannabis business tax so that the measure of the tax fairly reflects the
proportion of the taxed activity actually carried on in the unincorporated area
of the County. To the extent federal or state law requires that any tax due from
any taxpayer be apportioned, the taxpayer may indicate said apportionment
on his or her tax return. The Tax Administrator may promulgate administrative
procedures for apportionment as he or she finds useful or necessary.

3.30.180	Constitutionality and legality.

This tax is intended to be applied in a manner consistent with the United

interstate commerce, a violation of the equal protection or due process clauses
of the Constitutions of the United States or the State of California or a violation
of any other provision of the California Constitution or state law. If a person
believes that the tax, as applied to him or her, is impermissible under applicable
law, he or she may request that the Tax Administrator release him or her from
the obligation to pay the impermissible portion of the tax.

relating to tne gross receipts of the business) of persons engaged in cannabis
businesses. In conducting such investigation, the tax administrator shall
have the power to inspect any equipment, such as computers or point of sale
machines, that may contain such records.

B.	It shall be the duty of every person liable for the collection and payment
to the County of any tax imposed by this Chapter to keep and preserve, for a
period of at feast four (4) years, all records as may be necessary to determine
the amount of such tax as he or she may have been liable for the collection

designee shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times.

3.30.200	Other licenses, permits, taxes, fees or charges.

references made or contained in any other Chapter of this code to any licenses,
license taxes, fees, or charges, or to any schedule of license fees, shall be
deemed to refer to the licenses, license taxes, fees or charges, or schedule of
license fees, provided for in other Chapter of this Code.

required by Chapter 5.04 of this Code, any other Chapter of this Code or any
other ordinance or resolution of the County for any business that is delinquent
in the payment of any tax due pursuant to this Chapter or that fails to make a
deposit required by the tax administrator pursuant to Section 3.30.060.

3.30.210	Payment of tax does not authorize unlawful business.

A.	The payment of a cannabis business tax required by this Chapter, and its
acceptance by the County, shall not entitle any person to carry on any cannabis
business unless the person has complied with all of the requirements of this
Code and all other applicable state laws.

B.	No tax paid under the provisions of this Chapter shall be construed as
authorizing the conduct or continuance of any illegal or unlawful business, or
any business in violation of any local or state law.

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL
MEASURE D
MONO COUNTY CANNABIS BUSINESS TAX
(A GENERAL TAX)

The Mono County Board of Supervisors proposes “Measure D.” Approval of
Measure D would, beginning July 1,2018, impose a tax on each person engaged
in a cannabis business, including cultivation, processing, manufacturing,
distribution and sale, within the unincorporated area of Mono County (not within
the Town of Mammoth Lakes). The tax would not apply to personal cannabis
cultivation as defined in the “Medicinal and Adult Use Cannabis Regulation and
Safety Act” or to personal use of cannabis that is specifically exempted from
state licensing requirements and meets specified criteria. The details of the
proposed tax are contained in Ordinance 0RD18-02 of the Mono County Board
of Supervisors.

The cannabis business tax would be levied on cultivation based upon square
footage of plant canopy (including each level of canopy if plants are grown on
stacked shelves) and on other cannabis businesses based on gross receipts.

The tax rates for commercial cultivation are as follows:

-	$2.00 annually per square foot of canopy space in a facility that uses
exclusively artificial lighting, capped at $3.00 through June 30, 2021.

-	$1.50 annually per square foot of canopy space in a facility that uses
a combination of natural and supplemental artificial lighting, capped at
$2.50 through June 30,2021.

-	$.50 annually per square foot of canopy space in a facility that uses no
artificial lighting, capped at $1.50 through June 30,2021.

.50 annually per square foot of canopy space for any nursery, capped at

1.00 through June 30,2021.

On July 1, 2021, and on each following July 1, the maximum annual tax rate
er square foot of canopy space would increase by the percentage change
etween January of the calendar year prior to the increase and January of
the calendar year of the increase in the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”) for all
urban consumers in the Western Region as published by the United States
Government Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The tax on non-cultivation commercial cannabis business activity would be as
follows:

-	Testing laboratory: 1 % of gross receipts, not to exceed 2.5%.

-	Retail sales of cannabis as a retailer (dispensary) or non-store front
retailer (delivery) or microbusiness (retail sales): 4% of gross receipts, not
to exceed 8%.

-	Cannabis distribution business: 2% of gross receipts, not to exceed 4%.

-	Cannabis manufacturing, processing, or microbusiness (non-retail), or any
other type of commercial cannabis ousiness: 2.5% of gross receipts, not
to exceed 4%.

The Board of Supervisors may, by ordinance or resolution, increase the tax rates
for non- cultivation operations from the minimum percentages stated above to
the maximum percentages stated above.

The cannabis business tax is a general tax enacted solely for general
governmental purposes of Mono County and not for specific purposes. All of
fne proceeds from the proposed tax would be placed in Mono County’s general
fund and be available for any legal County purpose.

A “Yes” vote is a vote to approve the imposition of the tax.

A “No” vote is a vote against imposition of the tax.

The measure requires a simple majority vote for approval.

FISCAL IMPACT STATEMENT
Mono County Cannabis Business Tax
Measure D

The Mono County Finance Department has prepared the following fiscal impact
analysis of the proposed Cannabis Business Tax (CBT).

Fiscal Impact from County Finance Director:

This measure would authorize the County of Mono to add Chapter 3.30 to the
County Code, imposing a business tax on each person engaged in a cannabis
business, including cultivation, processing, manufacturing, distribution and
sale, in the unincorporated area of the County. The tax, if approved by voters, is
effective beginning July 1,2018.

Approval of this measure would establish a square footage canopy tax for
cultivators and a gross receipts tax for all other operators including testing
laboratories, retailers, dispensaries, distributors, manufacturers, processors,
and microbusinesses. The measure sets the canopy tax at an initial rate per
square foot of canopy allowed by the approved permit between 50 cents to
$2.00 per square foot, depending on whether plants are cultivated outside
without an enclosure or inside within an enclosure and the type of lighting
in use. The initial rate for the gross receipts tax is set between 1% and 4%,
depending on the type of license. The measure sets maximum rates of $1.00
to $3.00 per square foot for cultivators and 2.5% to 8% for all other license
types. The County Board of Supervisors would have the authority to adjust the
rate by resolution or ordinance. Beginning July 1,2021, the maximum rates in
this measure are indexed for inflation.

This ballot measure estimates increasing General Fund revenue from the
tax, with these revenues paying for increased General Fund expenditures
incurred for administrative costs related to tax collection and additional costs
in law enforcement, public health, emergency services and code enforcement
associated with the new cannabis industry. The amount of tax revenues, as
well as the additional costs, is uncertain because the number of permitted
businesses, the size of each cultivator, the amount of gross receipts each
business might generate, and the level of additional County services needed is
mostly unknown. Several factors influence the amount of revenues including
the number and type of licenses issued, the demand for and price of cannabis.
If eight operators are permitted, we estimate revenues from this measure may
range from $143,000 to $330,000. We estimate administrative costs of at least
$20,000, the addition of at least 1.5 new employment positions and costs of
additional County services at least $210,000. It this tax measure does not pass,
these costs would be paid for with County tax revenues paid by the existing
taxpayers in Mono County.

26-520

26520

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE D

This measure would require cannabis (marijuana) businesses operating within
unincorporated Mono County to pay taxes that will provide funds to address the
impacts created by this new industry. This is not a sales tax or income tax. ONLY
cannabis businesses would be subject to the tax.

This Measure applies ONLY OUTSIDE the Town of Mammoth Lakes, in
unincorporated Mono County. The Town is proposing a separate measure that
would apply within the Town and would not fund County activities.

On November 2016, California voters approved Proposition 64, which legalized
the recreational use of cannabis by adults in California. Over 40 cities and
counties in California have now enacted taxes on cannabis businesses to
address the increased burdens on local agencies’ budgets caused by cannabis
legalization.

Increased costs are anticipated in law enforcement, public health, emergency
services, code compliance, and other areas. The tax would fund increased
demands on County services resulting from this new industry, including
enforcement actions related to businesses operating illegally within the County.
Without this tax, those burdens would be borne oy the taxpayers of Mono
County.

The tax revenues generated by this measure will also help fund general County
services including law enforcement, emergency medical services, public health
and environmental protection. If this Measure is adopted, cannabis businesses
would be required to contribute funds to address the indirect impacts of the
cannabis industry—impacts that can’t otherwise be funded through direct fees
to these businesses.

A “yes” vote on this Measure ensures cannabis business operators contribute
a fair share toward the law enforcement, public health, code compliance,
emergency service and other efforts needed to preserve our community
character, natural environment, and quality of life in Mono County.
