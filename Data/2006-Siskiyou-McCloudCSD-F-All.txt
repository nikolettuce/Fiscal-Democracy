MEASURE F

A RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING AN ELECTION
TO ESTABLISH A NEW SPECIAL TAX STRUCTURE AND RATE
TO FUND FIRE PROTECTION, EMERGENCY RESPONSE
AND AMBULANCE SERVICES
WHEREAS, the McCloud Community Services District is authorized
by California Government Code 61600 et seq. and its enabling
legislation to provide fire protection and emergency response
services; and

WHEREAS, in a special election dated June 3, 1997, the voters
in McCloud approved a special parcel tax in the amount of $64.32
per year to fund fire and ambulance services; and
WHEREAS, since implementation of the fire and ambulance special
tax in 1997, the expenses of operating the fire department, emergency
response and ambulance services have exceeded revenues generated
by the special tax in a cumulative amount of $11,015.68; and
WHEREAS, the District Board of Directors finds that the District
cannot continue to fund, from District reserves, the expenses over
revenues for the Fire and Ambulance Department, that an increase
in special tax funding is required to maintain the current level of fire
suppression, emergency response and ambulance services to District
residents, that the residents of McCloud cannot afford to be without
the current level of fire suppression, emergency response and
ambulance services provided, and that a disruption in the level of
service could cost even more to District residents through increased
insurance premiums; and
WHEREAS, under direction from the District Board of Directors,
the Long Range Planning Advisory Committee evaluated various
funding mechanisms and tax structures and recommended as
follows: (1) that the Board of Directors seek voter approval for an
increase to the existing special tax, for fire, emergency response
and ambulance services; and
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the McCloud Community
Services District, on July 12, 2004, accepted and approved the
special tax recommendations of the Long Range Planning Advisory
Committee and hereby finds that an increase in special tax funding
is required to maintain the current level of fire suppression, emergency
response and ambulance services provided; and
WHEREAS, The McCloud Community Services District Board of
Directors proposes to impose a new special tax to replace the
existing special tax approved by voters on June 3,1997 at the rate
of $131.00 per Housing Equivalent (HE) per year; and
WHEREAS, California Government Code Sections 53720 through
53730 and 53739 authorize the imposition of a special tax by a local
agency after voter approval pursuant to Article XIIIC and XIIID of
the California Constitution; and
WHEREAS, it is proposed that the new special tax be levied to
replace the special tax approved by voters on June 3,1997 at varying
rates depending upon the classification of each parcel of real property
subject to the special tax into Categories 1 through 6 described
below, the criteria for such categories appearing in Attachment A
to this resolution which is incorporated herein by this reference,
which criteria include fire hazard code, construction class, fire factor,
water availability factor and fire hazard units. The application of
these criteria results in the assignment of Household Equivalents
(HE) for each parcel of real property subject to the special tax. The
total tax is calculated by multiplying the HE rate for each property
as set forth on Attachment A by the basic special tax rate for Category
1 of $131.00; and
WHEREAS, if the new special tax for fire protection, emergency
response and ambulance services is not approved by 2/3 of the
voters casting a ballot at the November 7, 2006 election, the original
fire/ambulance special tax enacted by the voters on June 3, 1997
shall remain in full force and effect.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Directors
of the McCloud Community Services District that the following
measure be placed on the ballot for vote in the general election to
be held on November 7, 2006 for a special tax to be collected in
the same manner and at the same time as ad valorem property
taxes are collected by the County of Siskiyou Auditor-Controller-Tax
Collector:

SHALL THE MCCLOUD COMMUNITY SERVICES DISTRICT LEVY
A NEW SPECIAL PARCEL TAX TO REPLACE THE EXISTING
SPECIAL TAX ENACTED BY THE VOTERS ON JUNE 3, 1997
COMMENCING IN FISCAL YEAR 2007-2008 TO PROVIDE FIRE
PROTECTION, EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND AMBULANCE
SERVICES AT THE RATES AND FOR THE LAND USE CATEGORIES

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL
MEASURE F
McCLOUD COMMUNITY SERVICES DISTRICT
ADOPTION OF A SPECIAL TAX
(FIRE PROTECTION, EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND
AMBULANCE SERVICES)

The McCloud Community Services District is proposing a special
tax to be submitted to the voters in the McCloud Community Services
District. The measure, if approved by two-thirds of the electors voting
on the question, would authorize the McCloud Community Services
District to levy a special tax upon each parcel at rates depending
upon the classification of each parcel as defined in Resolution 04,
2006 and Attachment A to the Resolution, adopted by the Board
of Directors of the McCloud Community Services District on
June 12, 2006. This special tax, if approved by the voters in the
McCloud Community Services District, would replace the special tax
approved and enacted by the voters on June 3, 1997 to fund fire
and ambulance services; if this measure is not approved, the special
tax approved and enacted by the voters on June 3, 1997 to fund
fire and ambulance services would remain in full force and effect.
If this measure is approved, commencing with fiscal year 2007-2008,
the amount of the special tax would be Sixty Five and 50/100 Dollars
($65.50) per year for “vacant lots”, One Hundred and Thirty One
Dollars ($131.00) per year for “residence-all services”, “duplex-all
services” and each of the other properties specifically identified
under “Category i” in Attachment A to Resolution 04, 2006, Two
Hundred and Sixty Two Dollars ($262.00) per year for each of the
properties specifically identified under “Category 2” in Attachment
A to Resolution 04, 2006, Three Hundred and Ninety Three Dollars
($393.00) per year for each of the properties specifically identified
under “Category 3” in Attachment A to Resolution 04, 2006, Five
Hundred and Twenty Four Dollars ($524.00) per year for each of
the properties specifically identified under “Category 4” in Attachment
A to Resolution 04,2006, Six Hundred and Fifty Five Dollars ($655.00)
per year for each of the properties specifically identified under
“Category 5” in Attachment A to Resolution 04, 2006 and Seven
Hundred and Eighty Six Dollars ($786.00) per year for each of the
properties specifically identified under “Category 6” in Attachment
A to Resolution 04, 2006.

If confirmed by the voters, the special tax would be levied effective
July 1, 2007. The tax would be collected at the same time and in
the same manner as ordinary County property taxes are collected
and would be subject to the same penalties and procedures in the
case of delinquency.

The special tax would be levied to establish a source of funds
so that the McCloud Community Services District can maintain current
levels of fire protection, emergency response and ambulance services
for the health, welfare and protection of life and property within the
McCloud Community Services District. The funds could not be used
for any other purposes.

A “yes” vote favors passage of the special parcel tax; a “no" vote
is against the passage of the special parcel tax.
