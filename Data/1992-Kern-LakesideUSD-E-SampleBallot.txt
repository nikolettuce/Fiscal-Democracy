IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL
LAKESIDE UNION SCHOOL DISTRICT
MEASURE E

A “Yes” vote by at least 2/3rds of the voters voting on this measure will
authorize collection of a special tax by, and establish a spending limit for, the
Communities Facilities District 91-1 {“District") of the Lakeside Union Ele-
mentary School District.

By law, a special tax is imposed for specific purposes and the revenue may
be used only for those purposes. In this case, the District intends to use the
special tax proceeds to renovate and remodel existing school facilities within
the District, to construct new school facilities and acquire sites for school
facilities, to construct or improve playgrounds and landscaping, and to
acquire portable classrooms, school buses and telecommunications and
computer systems in support of the District's public education program. In
order to accomplish these objectives, the District may sell bonds and use the
special tax revenue to pay the interest and principal as it becomes due.

If approved, the amount of the special taxes due on taxable property will
become a continuing lien on the property.

Agricultural property is exempt from the special tax levy. The maximum
special tax levied on other properties, according to their use, is as follows:
Residential property - $150 times the number of dwelling units on each
parcel;

Commercial property - $100 times the number of gross acres of the
commercial parcel; and

Undeveloped property - $650 times the number of gross acres in the
undeveloped parcel.

Undeveloped property will be taxed only in the event that sufficient special
tax revenue cannot be generated by applying the maximum tax rate available
on residential and commercial property.

Article XIII B of the California Constitution limits the amount of tax revenue
(called “appropriations”) that a taxing entity may spend each year. The
District, as a newly formed entity, has its appropriations limit established by
the voters. If this measure is approved, the amount of special tax revenue that
the District may spend in any fiscal year would be limited to $1,250,000.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE E

Lakeside Union Elementary School District needs your support for Meas-
ures D and E to provide facilities for our children.

The facts are:

•	Current facilities are 50 years old and in need of remodeling.

•	Lighting, heating, cooling and kitchen equipment must be updated.

•	The kitchen and cafeteria are too small for the number of students.

•	Enrollment has increased 72.9% since 1988 and will continue to grow.

•	Portable classrooms are not a permanent solution to the problem of
overcrowding.

•	The future growth needs of the district must be planned for now.

Passage of Measures D and E will allow our school district to:

At Silver Creek:

•	Construct a new school NOW.

•	Bond Measures D and E are the lowest cost alternatives available to
residents.

At Lakeside School:

•	Modernize the existing school buildings.

•	Enlarge the cafeteria and kitchen.

•	Replace the lights, coolers, heaters and flooring. Modernize the class-
room electrical systems.

•	Have the financial ability to construct additional schools as growth
requires.

You can be assured:

•	No funds raised will be spent on salaries.

•	State School Building money is not available.

•	Lottery funds can not be used for construction.

We must support our schools. “YES” votes on Measure D and E will do all
of these things at a reasonable cost. For Bond Measure E the expected
average tax rate over thirty-four years is $51.55 per home per year. This is a
tax per parcel and NOT figured on assessed value.

VOTE “YES" ON MEASURE E
