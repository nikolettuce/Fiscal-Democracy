IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL
SPECIAL TAX FOR NEW SCHOOL FACILITIES AND FURNISHINGS MEASURE A

This Analysis of the Special Tax for New School Facilities and Furnishings Measure is prepared
and submitted to the voters in accordance with section 5321 of the Elections Code.

Sections 50075-50077.5 of the Government Code authorize school districts to submit to the voters
for approval or rejection a measure authorizing the levying of a special tax and specifying procedures.
In 1988, the Legislature added section 50079 to the Government Code, authorizing school Districts
to impose qualified special taxes pursuant to the procedures of Sections 50075-50077.5. Such
qualified special taxes apply uniformly to all real property within the school District but may provide
for an exemption for those 65 years of age or older.

At an election on November 8, 1983, the voters of the Tulare City School District approved
Measure A, a special tax for a period of six years for the purpose of constructing and furnishing
new school facilities. That measure authorized both a special tax on building permits for residential
dwellings and a parcel tax on all parcels of land within the Tulare City School District.

If two-thirds of the qualified electors voting on this measure vote for approval, the Board of
Trustees of the Tulare City School District will be authorized to continue to levy a special parcel tax
upon all parcels of land located within the boundaries of the Tulare City School District. This special
tax if approved, will remain in effect for a period of six years beginning on January 1,1990 and the
proceeds thereof shall only be used for the purpose of constructing and furnishing new school
facilities. An exemption is provided for the dwelling of taxpayers 65 years of age or older, upon
written application and proof of age. In case of joint, common, or community ownership of real
property, all taxpayers with an ownership interest must qualify for this exemption to apply. The
special tax on applicants for building permits for residential dwellings previously approved would
expire December 31, 1989.

If two-thirds of the qualified electors voting on the measure do not vote for approval, the measure
will fail and the special tax previously approved by the voters in 1983 will terminate on December
31, 1989.

This special tax has no effect on the existing law and the electors who will be entitled to vote on
the measure will be those qualified electors who reside within the boundaries of the Tulare City
School District.

s/ Lita O’Neill Blatner
County Counsel

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE A

The Tulare City School District is one of the fastest growing districts in Tulare County. Conservative
projections indicate that the current school district population of approximately 6,000 students will
grow to 9,750 students during the next ten year period. This type of accelerated growth will create
a need for 125 classrooms to serve the educational needs of our children.

The State construction program does not have funds available to meet projected classroom needs
and State law prohibits the use of lottery funds for school construction.

The only viable solution left for the District is the continuance of Measure A. Measure A asks the
taxpayer to continue paying a very modest $25 per year parcel tax beginning January 1,1990 and
continuing through December 31, 1995. Senior citizens age 65 and over, upon request, will be
exempt from the tax.

The current Measure A, which expires December 31,1989, has been responsible for the construc-
tion of two new schools in Tulare without one cent having been paid in interest.

Considering the benefits of the current Measure A, the growth the Tulare City School District is
experiencing, and the fact that the new Measure A is not asking for a tax increase, we believe it is
in the best interest of all residents of the Tulare City School District that this Measure pass.

Vote yes! Our children are our most precious resource.
