<impartial> IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL

State law authorizes any city or county to impose a hotel/motel tax (“transient
occupancy tax") on occupants of hotels, motels, and other lodging facilities,
provided the occupancy lasts for 30 days or less. The law exempts certain
occupancies, such as camping in a state campground, and prohibits levying
the tax on the sale of food products, including beverages. If the tax is levied
by a board of supervisors, the law restricts the tax to the unincorporated area
of the county.

The Fresno County Board of Supervisors has adopted an ordinance which
would impose a hotel/motel tax in the unincorporated area of Fresno County
at the rate of 6 percent, for a period of 7 years. If the voters approved the tax,
it would become effective on January 1, 2005, and would be repealed
December 31, 2011.

The tax would apply to all temporary lodging places. However, in addition to
the exemptions required by state law, the definition of "hotel" in the ordinance
provides for certain local exemptions: (1) rooms in hospitals, nursing homes,
etc.; (2) vacation homes, cabins, or condominiums rented out only
occasionally by the owner when not using the facility personally; (3) facilities
rented to farmworkers by the farmer; (4) rooms rented to employees during
their employment; and (5) organized residential camps.

The ordinance provides that the revenues of the tax would be dedicated to
tourism promotion, and could only be used to supplement, not supplant,
existing County funding for tourism promotion. The tax revenues would also
be used to pay the costs of the election and of administering the tax. The
Fresno County Board of Supervisors would be responsible for the use of the
tax revenues.

Since the tax revenues would not be available for general County purposes,
the tax would be a special tax. This means that in order for the ballot
measure to be approved, at least two-thirds of the voters voting on the
measure must vote in favor of it. <impartialend>

FISCAL IMPACT STATEMENT

This ballot measure asks the electorate to impose a transient occupancy tax
on occupants of hotel rooms and other short-term rentals within the Fresno
County unincorporated areas at a rate of six percent (6%). If this measure
passes, the County of Fresno estimates the annual revenue from this tax to
be $489,000. The revenue from this tax will be used to provide funding for the
support of tourism.

This measure has a maintenance of effort provision. The revenues generated
by this measure shall be used only to supplement and not supplant existing
County revenues used for tourism promotion. The County is committed to
appropriating $200,000 per year from existing County revenues for the life of
the proposed Transient Occupancy Tax.

If this measure passes, the transient occupancy room tax will be effective
January 1,2005 and would continue in effect until December 31,2011.

If this measure does not pass, there will be no fiscal impact as the County of
Fresno does not currently have a transient occupancy tax and the County will
be reimbursed for the cost of adding the transient occupancy tax item to the
November 2, 2004 ballot. This reimbursable cost is estimated to be between
$40,000 and $60,000.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR

Measure J, the Tourism Jobs Initiative, means JOBS for Fresno County,
JOBS that stay here and can never be sent overseas. Funds will be used
exclusively for tourism promotion in ail areas of the county. The return on this
investment is more than 5,000 tourism-related jobs; increased visitor
spending and more local tourist revenues; and a positive image for Fresno
County.

This is NOT a tax on County residents. It is paid by travelers who stay in
hotels and motels in the County’s unincorporated areas. It reinstates a tax
that existed in Fresno County until it was eliminated in 1996 without voter
approval. Hotels and motels in the County’s 15 incorporated cities already
collect this tax and will not be affected by this measure.

N FR 056-019

All but 2 of California’s 58 counties have this tax. YOU pay these taxes when
you stay in other parts of the State or country. Visitors to our County should
pay similar taxes to fund a much needed investment in JOBS and economic
development - without increasing taxes for local residents.

Measure J is endorsed by the Regional Jobs Initiative, a bold plan to solve
our County’s double-digit unemployment. To insure accountability, Measure
J will expire in 7 years unless the voters decide to renew it.

The Fresno Business Council, the Greater Area Fresno Chamber of
Commerce, Shaver Lake Chamber of Commerce, Economic Development
Corporation, and NECA/Building & Construction Trades Council all endorse
Measure J. See www.YesOnJobs.org for more information and a complete
list of supporters.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR

VOTE NO

We all want more and better jobs for our community. But IMPOSING new
taxes isn’t the right approach or solution.

The proponents will tell you only those traveling from out-of-town will be
paying the tax.

Don’t be fooled. If this measure passes it will cost all of us extra money -
every time our family and friends travel and stay in Fresno County.

The Truth Is:

ALL OF US WILL BE TAXED. WHEN WE VISIT ANY OF OUR LOCAL
RESORT AREAS INCLUDING SHAVER. HUNTINGTON. RV PARKS
AND THE CAMPGROUNDS IN OUR COUNTY.

This tax and spend approach has been tried in other Counties. Yet over the
last 10 years (based on data from the tax proponent’s “experts"), Fresno
County has grown its tourism jobs without the burden of taxing our friends
and family.

A new tax does not bring prosperity nor does it create jobs beyond the
bureaucracies it creates. The last thing we need is NEW TAXES to fund NEW
BUREAUCRACIES. This new tax, locks Fresno County into spending nearly
$1.5 Million in existing General Fund dollars - none can be spent on public
safety.

So why adopt an approach that will do nothing but slow our existing
tourist job growth rate?

There’s also plenty of analysis to show the proponents claim of 5,000 new
jobs is based on outdated and poorly evaluated information. Just ask
yourself, will a government tax and spend ad campaign, promote our
tourist industry better than the tourist industry itself?

The proponents have a new ploy for region-wide NEW TAXES. They claim
they will spend the NEW TAXES to promote our tourist industry. They
claim they know better how to promote tourism than the private business
owners. They claim they know better how to create jobs than he business
owners.

They claim that those who oppose their NEW TAX SCHEMES just
don’t understand their wisdom. But, HIGHER TAXES is a wrong-
headed approach for creating new jobs. Every business owner knows
that HIGHER TAXES will lose you customers, not win more.

The last thing we need is NEW TAXES to fund NEW BUREAUCRACIES
managed by downtown Fresno bureaucrats.

That’s right, it’s just another NEW BUREAUCRACY with a new name. It’s just
another TAXPAYER FUNDED BOONDOGGLE.

They are so embarrassed about this new TAXPAYER FUNDED
BOONDOGGLE that they don’t want to call it a tax. They’re trying to call this
a “Traveler’s Lodging Charge”, or “TLC”. But FIAISING TAXES from you, me
and our visiting family and friends is hardly TLC.

This commitment locks our County into paying millions for this program,
without any measure for success. This auto-pilot spending will take millions
from our GENERAL FUND which could instead go to areas of county
government such as public safety.

Say No to New Bureaucrats. Say No to New Boondoggles. Say No to
New Wasteful Taxes.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST
DON’T BE MISLED! The facts are:

>	ALL OF US PAY THIS TAX WHEN WE STAY OVERNIGHT ANYWHERE
OUTSIDE FRESNO COUNTY. More than 75% of the travelers who will
pay this lodging charge will come from outside our County and THEY
SHOULD PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE.

>	THIS IS NOT A NEW TAX. Measure J REINSTATES a tax that was in
effect from before 1964 to 1996 when it was removed without voter
approval. It applies only to lodging facilities in the County's
unincorporated area and NOT to public campgrounds.

>	THIS IS NOT A NEW BUREAUCRACY. It’s a non-profit private-public
partnership similar to others that have been successful nationwide.

>	BUSINESS SUPPORTS MEASURE J. The Fresno Business Council,
Business Journal, Economic Development Corporation, Greater Fresno
Area Chamber of Commerce, and Fresno City and County Hotel/Motel
Association endorse Measure J. Hundreds of other supporters are listed
at www.YesOnJobs.org.

>	The opponents know better. THIS DOES NOT “LOCK OUR COUNTY

INTO PAYING MILLIONS..." Travelers who stay overnight in the
County’s unincorporated area pay the tax, not the County.

>	THIS WILL NOT TAKE MILLIONS FROM OUR GENERAL FUND.

Instead, it will contribute to the General Fund as tourism earnings and
business growth generate sales and property tax revenues.

THIS IS ABOUT CREATING JOBS, BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, AND A
POSITIVE IMAGE FOR OUR COUNTY! Get all the facts at

For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to

operator. This tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the County which
is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the County. The transient
shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the
rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with
each installment. Any unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient's ceasing to

directly to the Tax Collector.

Schedules.

payment of tax to the operator may be deferred in accordance therewith, and the
operator shall be liable therefor at the time and to the extent that such credits are
paid or deferred payments are made in accordance with the rate of tax owing on
the amount thereof.

The Tax Collector shall enforce the provisions of this chapter and shall
have the power to adopt rules and regulations not inconsistent herewith as may
be necessary or desirable to aid in the enforcement hereof. He or she shall

extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The
amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged,
and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the operator No

refunded except in the manner hereinafter provided.

4.18.070. Registration of Operator; Form and Contents;

Execution; Certification of Authority.

Every person engaging or about to engage in business as an operator of a
hotel in the unincorporated area of this County shall register with the Tax
Collector on a form provided by the Tax Collector. Persons engaged in such
business must so register not later than January 1, 2005, or within fifteen days
after commencing business, whichever is later, but such privilege of registration
after the date of imposition of such tax shall not relieve any person from the
obligation of payment or collection of tax on and after the date of imposition
thereof, regardless of registration. Such registration shall set forth the name
under which such person transacts or intends to transact business, the location
of the place or places of business and such other information to facilitate the
collection of the tax as the Tax Collector may require. The registration shall be
signed by the owner if a natural person; in case of an association or partnership,
by a member or partner; in the case of a corporation, by an executive officer or
some person specifically authorized by the corporation to sign the registration.
The Tax Collector shall within ten days after such registration issue without
charge a certificate of authority to each registrant to collect the tax from the
occupant, together with a duplicate thereof for each additional place of business
of such registrant. Such certificates shall be non-assignable and non-
transferable and shall be surrendered immediately to the Tax Collector upon the

cessation of business at the location named or upon its sale or transfer. Each
certificate and duplicate shall state the place of business to which it is applicable
and shall be prominently displayed therein so as to be seen and come to the
notice readily of all occupants and persons seeking occupancy.

The certificate shall, among other things, state the following:

(1)	The name of the operator;

(2)	The address of the hotel;

(3)	The date upon which the certificate was issued;

(4)	The following statement:	'This	Transient Occupancy Registration

Certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the
requirements of the transient occupancy tax ordinance of the County of Fresno
by registration with the Tax Collector for the purpose of collecting from transients
the occupancy tax imposed by said County and remitting the tax to the Tax
Collector. This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful
business or to conduct any lawful business in an unlawful manner, or to operate
a hotel without strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including but not
limited to those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department, or
office of the County. This certificate does not constitute a permit."

If the Tax Collector deems it necessary in order to facilitate initial
registration hereunder of persons engaged in business on or prior to the date of
imposition of tax as set forth in this chapter, he or she may prescribe provisions
therefor other than those provided in this section. Such provisions shall be made
to effect the purposes hereof. For such purposes, such provisions shall be in lieu

thereof shall have the same effect as that provided herein
4.18.080. Penalties and Interest.

section

(d)	Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to
remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one-half of
one percent (0.5%) per month or fraction thereof on the amount of the tax,
exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became
delinquent until paid.

(e) Penalties Merged With Tax. Every penalty imposed and such interest
as accrues under the provisions of this section shall be merged with and become
a part of the tax herein required to be paid.

4.18.090. Due Date; Returns and Payments.

(a)	The tax imposed by this chapter shall become due and payable from
the occupant at the time of occupancy. All amounts of such taxes collectible or
collected by any operator are due and payable to the Tax Collector quarterly on
the first day of the months of April, July, October, and January next succeeding
each respective quarterly period and are delinquent after the last day of such
months.

(b)	On or before the last day of the month following each quarterly period
of three months, a return for the preceding quarterly period shall be filed with the
Tax Collector. The return shall be filed in such form as the Tax Collector may
prescribe, by every operator and by every person liable to payment of tax
hereunder during such quarterly period who has not paid such tax, and who has
not made return in regard to the related occupancy which is the subject of tax.

(c)	Returns shall show the amount of tax collected or otherwise due for the
related period and such other information as is required by the Tax Collector.
The Tax Collector may require returns to show the total rentals upon which tax
was collected or otherwise due, the gross receipts of a registered returnee for
such period and the explanation in detail of any discrepancy between such

amounts.

(d)	The person required to file the return shall deliver the return, together
with the remittance of the amount of the tax due, to the Tax Collector at his or her

office.

(e)	For good cause the Tax Collector may extend for not to exceed one
month the time for making any return or payment of tax. No further extension
shall be granted, except by the Board of Supervisors. Any person to whom an
extension is granted who makes return and pays the tax within the period of such
extension shall pay, in addition to the tax, interest on the amount thereof at the
rate of one-half of one percent (0.5%) per month, or fraction thereof, on the
unpaid balance for the period of such extension to the time of return and
payment, which interest shall become a part of the tax.

(f)	The Tax Collector, if he or she deems it necessary in order to insure
payment or facilitate collection by the County of the amount of taxes in any
individual case, may require returns and payment of the amount of taxes for
other than quarterly periods.

4.18.100. Deficiency Determinations.

(a)	If the Tax Collector is not satisfied with the return or returns of the tax
or the amount of the tax required to be paid to the County by any person, he or
she may compute and determine the amount required to be paid upon the basis
of the facts contained in the return or returns or upon the basis of any information
within his or her possession or that may come into his or her possession. One or
more deficiency determinations may be made of the amount due for one or more
than one period.

(b)	The amount of the determination, exclusive of penalties, shall bear
interest at the rate of one-half of one percent (0.5%) per month, or fraction
thereof, from the last day of the month following the close of the quarterly period
for which the amount or any portion thereof should have been returned until the
date of payment.

(c)	In making a determination the Tax Collector may offset overpayments,
if any, which may have been previously made for a period or periods together
with interest on the overpayments, against any underpayment for a subsequent
period or periods, or against penalties, and interest, on the underpayments. The
interest on underpayments and overpayments shall be computed in the manner
set forth in Section 4.18.080.

(d)	If any part of the deficiency for which a deficiency determination is
made is due to negligence or intentional disregard of this chapter or authorized
rules and regulations but not amounting to fraud or intent to evade, a penalty of
ten percent (10%) of the amount of the determination shall be added thereto.

(e)	If any part of the deficiency for which a deficiency determination is
made is due to fraud or an intent to evade this chapter or authorized rules and
regulations, a penalty of twenty-five percent (25%) of the amount of the
determination shall be added thereto.

(f)	The Tax Collector shall give to the operator or occupant written notice
of the Tax Collector s determination. The notice may be served personally or by
mail; if by mail, the notice shall be enclosed in a sealed envelope, postage
prepaid and addressed to the operator at his or her address as it appears in the

records of the Tax Collector. In case of service by mail of any notice required by
this chapter, the service is complete at the time of deposit in the United States
mail.

(g) Except in the case of fraud, intent to evade this chapter or authorized
rules and regulations, or failure to make a timely return, every deficiency
determination shall be made and notice thereof mailed within three years after
the last day of the month following the close of the quarterly period for which the
amount is proposed to be determined or within three years after the return is
filed, whichever period expires the later.

(h)	If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect the tax or to make, within
the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of the tax or any
portion thereof required by this chapter, or makes a fraudulent return or
otherwise willfully attempts to evade this chapter, the Tax Collector shall proceed
in such manner as he or she may deem best to obtain facts and information on
which to base his or her estimate of the tax due. As soon as the Tax Collector
shall procure such facts and information as he or she is able to obtain upon
which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by
any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such
report and remittance, the Tax Collector shall proceed to determine and assess
against such operator the tax, interest, and penalties provided for by this chapter.
In case such determination is made, the Tax Collector shall give a notice in the
manner aforesaid of the amount so assessed. Such determination and notice
shall be made and mailed within three years after discovery by the Tax Collector

of any fraud, intent to evade or failure to file return. Any determination shall
become final within thirty (30) days after giving notice thereof as herein provided

(i)	If the Tax Collector believes that the collection of any tax or any amount
of tax required to be collected and paid to the County will be jeopardized by
delay, or if any determination will be jeopardized by delay, he or she shall
thereupon make a determination of the tax or amount of tax required to be
collected, noting that fact upon the determination. The amount determined is
immediately due and payable. If the amount specified in the determination is not
paid within ten days after service of notice thereof upon the person against whom
the determination is made, the amount becomes final at the expiration of the ten
days, unless a petition for redetermination is filed within the ten days and the
delinquency penalty and the interest provided in Section 4 18.080 shall attach to
the amount of the tax or the amount of the tax required to be collected.

4.18.110. Redeterminations.

(a)	Any person against whom a determination is made under Section
4.18.100 or any person directly interested may petition for a redetermination
within fifteen days after service upon the person of notice thereof. If a petition for
redetermination is not filed within the fifteen day period, the determination
becomes final at the expiration of the period, provided, however, that a petition
for redetermination under subdivision (i) of Section 4.18.100 shall be filed within
ten days after notice.

(b)	If a petition for redetermination is filed within the allowable period, the
Tax Collector shall reconsider the determination, and, if the person has so

requested in his or her petition, shall grant the person an oral hearing and shall
give him or her ten days’ notice of the time and place of the hearing. The Tax
Collector may continue the hearing from time to time as may be necessary.

(c)	The Tax Collector may decrease or increase the amount of the
determination before it becomes final but the amount may be increased only if a
claim for the increase is asserted by the Tax Collector at or before the hearing.

(d)	The order or decision of the Tax Collector upon a petition for
redetermination becomes final fifteen days after service upon the petitioner of
notice thereof, unless appeal of such order or decision is filed with the Board of
Supervisors within fifteen days after service of such notice.

(e)	No petition for redetermination or appeal therefrom shall be effective
for any purpose unless at or before the filing thereof the amount found due in the
original determination is paid or a bond or other security satisfactory to the Tax
Collector is filed with the Tax Collector guaranteeing payment of any amount
finally determined to be due.

4.18.120. Security for Collection of Tax.

(a)	The Tax Collector, whenever he or she deems it necessary to insure
compliance with this chapter, may require any person subject thereto to deposit
with him or her such security in the form of cash, bond, or other security as the
Tax Collector may determine. The amount of the security shall be fixed by the
Tax Collector but shall not be greater than twice the person's estimated average
liability for the period for which he or she files returns, determined in such
manner as the Tax Collector deems proper, or ten thousand dollars ($10,000),

whichever amount is the lesser. The amount of the security may be increased or
decreased by the Tax Collector subject to the limitations herein provided.

(b)	If any person is delinquent in the payment of the amount required to be
paid by him or her or in the event a determination has been made against him or
her which remains unpaid, the Tax Collector may, not later than three years after
the payment became delinquent, give notice thereof by registered mail to all
persons in the County having in their possession or under their control any
credits or other personal property belonging to the delinquent, or owing any debts
to the delinquent. After receiving the notice the persons so notified shall neither
transfer nor make any other disposition of the credits, other personal property, or
debts in their possession or under their control at the time they receive the notice
until the Tax Collector consents to a transfer or disposition or until twenty days
elapse after the receipt of the notice. All persons so notified shall within five days
after the receipt of the notice advise the Tax Collector of all such credits, other
personal property, or debts in their possession, under their control, or owing by
them.

(c)	At any time within three years after any tax or any amount of tax
required to be collected becomes due and payable or at any time within three
years after any determination becomes final, the Tax Collector may bring an
action in the courts of this State, or any other state, or of the United States in the
name of the County of Fresno to collect the amount delinquent together with
penalties and interest.

(d)	If any operator liable for any amount under this chapter sells out the
business or quits the business, his or her successors or assigns shall withhold
sufficient of the purchase price to cover such amount until the former owner
produces a receipt from the Tax Collector showing that he or she has been paid
or a certificate stating that no amount is due. If the purchaser of a business fails
to withhold the tax from the purchase price as required, he or she becomes
personally liable for the payment of the amount required to be withheld by him or
her to the extent of the purchase price, valued in money. Within thirty days after
receiving a written request from the purchaser for a certificate, the Tax Collector
shall either issue the certificate or mail notice to the purchaser at his or her
address as it appears on the records of the Tax Collector of the amount that must
be paid as a condition of issuing the certificate. Failure of the Tax Collector to
mail the notice will release the purchaser from any further obligation to withhold
the purchase price as above provided. The time within which the obligation of a
successor may be enforced shall start to run at the time the operator sells out the
business or at the time that the determination against the operator becomes final,
whichever event occurs the later.

4.18.130. Refunds.

Whenever the amount of any tax, penalty, or interest has been paid more
than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the Tax
Collector under this chapter, it may be refunded provided a verified claim in
writing therefor, stating the specific ground upon which the claim is founded, is
filed with the Tax Collector within three years from the date of payment. The

claim shall be made on forms provided by the Tax Collector. If the claim is
approved by the Tax Collector the excess amount collected or paid may be
refunded or may be credited on any amounts then due and payable from the
person from whom it was collected or by whom paid and the balance may be
refunded to such person, or to his or her administrators or executors
4.18.140. Appeal.

Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the Tax Collector may appeal
to the Board of Supervisors by filing a notice of appeal with the Clerk of the
Board of Supervisors within fifteen (15) days of the serving or mailing of the
notice of the action. The Board of Supervisors shall fix a time and place for
hearing such appeal, and the Clerk shall give notice in writing to such operator at
his or her last known place of address. The findings of the Board of Supervisors
shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the
manner prescribed above for service of notices. Any amount found to be due
shall be immediately and payable upon the service of notice.

4.18.150. Records.

It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment
to the County of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a
period of three years and six months, all records as may be necessary to
determine the amount of such tax as he or she may have been liable for the
collection of and payment to the County, which records the Tax Collector shall
have the right to inspect and audit at all reasonable times.

(3)	The disclosure of information and results of examination of records of
particular taxpayers, or relating to particular taxpayers, to a court of law in a

business done in the County.

4.18.170. Saving Clause.

If any section, subsection, subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause, or

Regional Jobs Initiative Tourism Cluster Implementation Plan

There is unanimous consensus that Fresno’s tourism industry is an underachieving gold mine, a
sleeping giant Tourism is Fresno’s largest industry, second only to agriculture, with
approximately 14,000 non-farm jobs in 2002 The tourism industry represents the greatest
opportunity for creating hundreds to thousands of new jobs, many of which would be entry level
positions well suited to our region’s current workforce That’s the good news

The bad news is a pervasive climate of mistrust and counterproductive political agendas among
tounsm stakeholders. The result has been adherence to the status quo The tourism industry has
not united behind a broad, cohesive vision for promoting regional tourism. In the absence of an
innovative and aggressive marketing plan, Fresno County isn’t even competing with Kern and
Kings Counties1 Ted Sprague, the consultant hired by Fresno County to develop a general
tourism plan, observed Fresno’s unique propensity to undermine and sabotage rather than
collaborate Sprague noted if Fresno’s tourism stakeholders were a football team, when the
quarterback dropped back to throw a pass, the defensive line wouldn’t come into play because
the offensive line would rather sack their own quarterback than see the play succeed This
mindset must change to benefit from the tremendous potential that tourism represents for Fresno
County and the region

The Regional Jobs Initiative (RJI) is founded on the “Community Values of the Fresno Region”
which embraces collaboration and putting the broader interests of the community and region
ahead of personal or political agendas The RJI is a growing and increasingly powerful
partnership of public agencies and private sector business leaders Public sector RJI leaders
include the city of Fresno, the city of Clovis, Fresno County, and California State University,
Fresno More than 200 businesses from the private sector are involved in the RJI and this
number continues to grow as identified industry clusters gain momentum and expand This
unprecedented communitywide approach to attacking our area’s chronic unemployment rate has
commanded the attention of state and federal legislators who have made the RJI’s success a top
priority

Tourism was identified as one of the RJI’s industry clusters and a preliminary implementation
plan was developed The RJI’s Implementation Plan for the Tourism Cluster includes Initiative
#9: Establish a Regional Tourism and Visitors Authority (RTVA). The RTVA would be
responsible and accountable for making the Fresno region a tourist destination and increasing the
number of visitors and visitor spending in the region

For the RJI, the challenge has been identifying the appropriate structure and funding for the
RTVA Some tourism stakeholders believe the RTVA should be a function of the already
existing Convention and Visitors Bureau (CVB) Others suggest waiting to see how the SMG
transition will affect the CVB before moving forward with an RTVA Some prefer a new
“tourism association” model to fund the RTVA while others favor various public-private
partnership arrangements

1 In 2001, Fresno ranked 36* of 58 counties in Visitor-Related Job Growth Increases, Item County ranked 17* and
Kings County ranked 9*

- 7-

None of these approaches will achieve the RJl’s goals for tourism and job creation as discussed
below

There are many interesting tourism promotion efforts underway throughout the County but these
efforts are fragmented There is no unifying umbrella organization with adequate financial
resources to promote and market attractions and special events Countywide With just two
employees, the Fresno County Office of Tourism does what it can to fill this void but staff time
and limited marketing budgets can only stretch so far That means Fresno County’s 15
incorporated cities are more or less on their own when it comes to marketing and promoting
special events and festivals The Greater Fresno Area Chamber of Commerce is left to market
the highly popular Blossom Trail as best it can relying heavily on volunteers to answer phones
and replace trail signs Twenty businesses in Shaver Lake are investing to promote tounsm in
their area There is minimal promotion for the Sequoia/Kings Canyon National Park and little
has been done to make Fresno the primary point of departure for visitors to Yosemite National
Park Building on existing tounsm promotional efforts, a well funded RTVA could coordinate
and maximize tourism marketing and promotion in all areas of the County and region

The RJI does not wish to preclude the new RTVA’s board of directors from establishing a
mission, goals, specific marketing plans, and funding priorities. However, to create a vision
for the new RTVA and the tremendous benefits it will bring to the entire County, the RJI is
presenting this proposal for forming and operating the RTVA

Proposed RTVA Mission:

■	To promote tourism in all areas of the County

■	To enhance the marketing and promotion of existing attractions, festivals, and events

■	To provide visitors and tourists with seamless coordination of regional tounsm (one stop
Website and one stop 24/7 toll free phone number)

Proposed RTVA Goals:

■	To successfully compete in the tourism industry with counties of comparable or larger
size

■	To strengthen existing attractions, festivals, and events and foster the creation of new
tourism related businesses

■	To increase visitor spending in the region

■	To increase the number of jobs in the tourism industry

What We Have To Market / What Will REALLY Attract Tourists:

■	Agritourism

■	Trails

■	Charming small towns

■	Multi-cultural festivals and events

■	Sports

■	Outdoor recreation (inexpensive compared to other areas)

■	Proximity to three National Parks

Agritourism

Agntourism is a growing phenomena worldwide It has been identified as a way to preserve
smaller family farms while at the same time, meeting a need to reconnect “city people” to how
food and fiber are grown and processed The University of California Small Farm Center has
made a significant commitment to agritourism and is offering a series of workshops throughout
the State to help farmers, marketers, and tounsm entrepreneurs take advantage of this
opportunity

The Fresno County Office of Tounsm has focused on this as its first pnority for these reasons
With 32 businesses and 13 chambers of commerce, downtown associations, and/or cities as
“partners”, the Fruit Trail officially launched on May 1 and is hoping for significant success as
measured by the number of calls for information, visitors reported by agritounsm “partners” and
interest from travel writers and editors that generates free publicity Sunset Magazine inquired
about the Fruit Trail as a result of press releases sent to approximately 300 national and
international travel writers A tour group from Belgium visited the first week in June

If the Fruit Trail proves successful, plans are underway for a “Fall Color Trail” that would
include pumpkin patches, com mazes, similar Halloween activities, Christmas tree farms, and
shopping opportunities These trails would create an almost year-round attraction centered on
agritounsm

Perhaps the most advantageous aspect of agritounsm is the limited capital improvements that are
needed in Fresno County More than anything, innovative agritounsm packages need to be
created and aggressively marketed Sample agritounsm packages might include

■	Bus tours featunng small town festivals, stops along the Fruit Trail, and possibly even
day trips to national parks

■	Amtrak packages combined with small town festivals and/or multi-cultural events

■	Packages featuring wine tasting and/or culinary extravaganzas

■	Self-guided tours with recommendations for additional nearby activities and
entertainment

Agritounsm marketing should be designed to get people to spend as many nights in Fresno
County as possible and to tell their friends and neighbors about their enjoyable experiences

Trails

Trails are growing in popularity because they give people “healthy” outdoor recreational
opportunities Besides the Fruit Trail, Fresno County has a wealth of bicycling trails, equestrian
trails, hiking trails, and snow trails If the Golden State Corridor plan comes to fruition, the
County will also have an outstanding rail trail connecting the communities of Kingsburg, Selma,
Sanger, Fowler, and possibly Fresno

As with agntourism, the County’s trails are simply not marketed as tourist activities or packaged
in conjunction with festivals and events An inventory of trail activities and events should be
completed and used to develop packages that combine trail activities with overnight stays,
entertainment, and other amenities of interest to bicyclists, equestrians, hikers, and cross country
skiers

Charming Small Towns

Tourists are increasingly looking for small town atmospheres with festivals and unique events
Most of Fresno County’s 15 incorporated cities have a variety of festivals, farmers markets,
street fairs, concerts, and special events throughout the year Each community is left to promote
its own events on limited budgets because there is no regional approach to tourism In the fall of
2003, the Fresno County Office of Tourism sent a press release about holiday festivals and
events throughout the County Kingsburg’s Santa Lucia festival in December had 8,000 people,
its largest attendance ever When asked how visitors heard about the Santa Lucia festival, people
reported reading about it in the “things to do” section of Bay Area papers We might not think of
driving 3 hours to attend a small town festival but people in large cities feel differently

Multi-Cultural Festivals and Events

From the Hmong New Year to Viva el Mariachi, Fresno and surrounding areas have an
abundance of multi-cultural festivals and events that would intrigue and attract tourists if they
were invited Amtrak would be an ideal partner for many of the festivals and events held in
downtown Fresno Imagine an Amtrak car with a mariachi band entertaining passengers on their
way from Bakersfield or the Bay Area to Fresno for Viva el Mariachi or the Taco Festival Or,
imagine a Hmong in traditional dress explaining the history and cultural of the Hmong as
Amtrak brings visitors to the Hmong New Year Amtrak offers a historical narrator on a “history
car” on trains crossing the southwest so other regions have successfully partnered with Amtrak in
ways our region hasn’t even considered

Sports

Clovis already has the highly successful pole vaulting championships which could be marketed
by the RTVA The RTVA could work with the Bulldog sports program to coordinate tounsm
packages for visiting teams Remember the old Fresno Track and Field Relays that faded into
oblivion because Ratcliffe Stadium was too small? This event has been resurrected as the Bob
Fraley Relays but even local people aren’t aware of this

Like Selma’s band festival and review which is the largest event of its kind west of the Rockies,
Fresno could sponsor championships for Little Leagues, Pop Warner teams, and high school
football, basketball, and softball teams Optimistically, California schools won’t always be
financially distressed so presumably, teams could afford to travel to Fresno for various types of
competitions with visits to Yosemite or Sequoia/Kings Canyon National Park included

Fresno has the opportunity to offer tournaments for softball, basketball, tennis, golf, volleyball,
gymnastics, and other sports With the beautiful Grizzlies Stadium, the new Granite Park sports
and entertainment complex at Cedar and Dakota, and other outstanding facilities, we simply need
the vision and funds to market a variety of exciting opportunities and events

Outdoor Recreation

Shaver Lake is a perfect example of extraordinary opportunities for outdoor recreation In fact,
Southern California Edison is working on a Shaver Lake Community plan update that will
incorporate Edison’s plans for expanding its recreational business which has become more
profitable than logging For people from Southern California, Shaver Lake is an attractive
alternative to Lake Arrowhead and other more expensive weekend resorts Boat rentals are half
the price, fishing is better, the lake is less congested and less developed, and the Edison
Campground is rated as among the country’s best Shaver Lake has interesting community

events throughout the summer including a bass fishing derby, blue festival, car show, and Fourth
of July fireworks over the lake after a parade of decorated boats

Huntington Lake is also renowned as an ideal lake for sailing and camping Dedicated mountain
bicyclists ride to the Kaiser Summit starting from Shaver Lake or Huntington Lake In the
winter, Sierra Summit is a well kept secret for snow skiers Lift tickets are so much less than
comparable resorts in other parts of the state, ski packages should be an easy sell

Again, businesses and communities are left to promote what they have to offer by themselves on
their own If the RTVA did nothing else but serve as a clearinghouse to pull all these fragmented
marketing efforts together and enhance existing marketing efforts, the tounsm industry in Fresno
County and the region would benefit greatly

National Parks

Fresno must distinguish itself as the primary point of departures for visitors to three national
parks There are many ways to do this but we should start with the Fresno Yosemrte
International Airport Our community does not offer a shuttle service to any of the national
parks There is no easy way to arrange group tours to Yoscmite or Sequoia/Kings Canyon
National Park Tour operators have to find their own charter buses, lodging, dining options, and
itineraries which are not easy challenges if you haven’t been here before The RTVA could
make this process much easier for tour groups wanting to visit the national parks

City of Fresno

The City of Fresno has a wealth of amenities that attract tounsts Fresno’s participation in
regional tounsm is essential and requires the involvement and collaboration of everyone from the
Fresno Yoscmite Airport to SMG and the Conventions Bureau

Heritage

Fresno has not capitalized on its heritage as the home of William Saroyan or other famous people
and personalities Even the City of Salinas has invested in a tribute to John Steinbeck. The
RTVA should help identify and foster the growth of major new attractions that draw upon our
rich historical heritage

Marketing Plan and Marketing Priorities

After formation, the RTVA Board of Directors would probably want to develop a specific
marketing plan and priorities based on the amount of Finding available It would ideal if the
tourism efforts started by the Fresno County Office of Tourism focusing on public-private efforts
like the Fruit Trail would be continued and expanded Attention should be given to key industry
stakeholders like Wonder Valley Ranch Resort and the Inn at Harris Ranch The RJI will
attempt to use its political leverage to get Chevron’s authorization to repaint Coalinga’s Iron Zoo
so Iron Zoo/Harris Ranch packages can be marketed Similarly, the RJI will encourage the
RTVA to market ski packages for the benefit of Sierra Summit and work with Wonder Valley
Ranch Resort and Shaver Lake businesses to insure that tourism is promoted countywide as
fairly as possible

Proposed Funding

The RJI researched various funding options that might achieve the estimated $4 million that
should be spent promoting tourism on a countywide basis The RJI is recommending a Six
Percent (6%) Travelers’ Lodging Charge (TLC) be imposed on properties in the County’s

-5-

unincorporated areas in addition to hotels, motels, and bed and breakfasts, the TLC would
apply to campgrounds with RV hookups and vacation home rentals The TLC measure would be
written to avoid impacting the bottom lines of businesses that sell rooms on the “American”
plan, it would apply only to room nights sold or contracted after the tax was implemented It
would also apply only to the cost of the room, not to meals or activities included m package
offerings

Since the County does not require business licenses, it has been difficult to obtain the names of
facilities likely to be affected and the number of rooms or spaces at each facility to project likely
TLC revenues for the RTVA However, the County was generating approximately $800,000 in
1996 when the 8% TOT tax was eliminated There are several more properties in the County’s
unincorporated areas and the inclusion of RV campgrounds and vacation home rentals could
mean the TLC will generate at least $800,000 per year if not more

In addition to the TLC, funding would be derived from the City of Fresno (approximately
$200,000 annually). City of Clovis (between $20,000 and $40,000 annually), and Fresno County
($200,000 annually) At some point within the first two years of operation, the RJI would work
with the RTVA to request a percentage of the increase in Fresno and Clovis City TOT taxes as
new hotels are built and tourism marketing produces results

Other RTVA sources of funding would include private-public partnerships like the Fruit Trail,
commissions from tourism packages, referral fees from the concierge service, and memberships

The proposed TLC would be a special tax that could only be used for tounsm Such a special tax
requires 3 of the 5 members of the Board of Supervisors to vote in favor of placing the TLC tax
on a general election ballot County Counsel has determined that everyone in the County can
vote on the TLC measure and 67% must vote in favor for the measure to pass August 3, 2004,
is the last day for the Board of Supervisors to vote to put the TLC measure on the ballot If we
miss this opportunity, the next opportunity to obtain a “special” TLC dedicated solely to
promoting tounsm will be in November, 2006

The RJI is asking members of the Board of Supervisors to support the TLC for tourism on the
November 2, 2004, ballot and is working to gain maximum industry support for the TLC
measure

Proposed RTVA Structure

There are several possible structures for the RTVA

■	A Commission created by ordinance of the Board of Supervisors (can also be disbanded
by ordinance of the Board of Supervisors), Commission members would be appointed by
the Board of Supervisors, although this would be the most expeditious way to get an
authonty started, it would not achieve the desired level of independent public and private
collaboration

■	Joint powers agreement (JPA) which requires each public agency involved to vote to
participate in the authority Under State law, California State University, Fresno, would
not be able to serve as a voting member of the JPA It would take a considerable amount
of time to obtain each public agency’s approval and public vote to participate in this type
of structure

- 6 -

■	An authority created by State legislation which would also having taxing authority This
would take too long and in today's climate, having the authority to tax is not that
advantageous

■	A non-profit corporation that in turn contracts with Fresno County and the Fresno County
Officer of Tourism to develop and administer on-going tounsm programs Given the
RJI’s desire to move the tourism initiative forward quickly, this is the most logical
structure for a new tourism authority

There is general consensus that a public-private Board of Directors should run the RTVA
Current RJI thinking is to keep the Board as small as possible but to be inclusive enough to
represent the entire County Furthermore, the RJI is trying to eliminate Board seats linked to
funding because that mindset runs counter to what the RJI is trying to create an authority that
will market tourism for the benefit of all regardless of a municipality’s ability to pay With this
in mind, the proposed composition of the Board is

■	One seat for the Chair of the Fresno County Board of Supervisors or his/her designee

■	One seat for the Mayor of the City of Fresno or his/her designee

■	One seat for the Mayor of the City of Clovis or his/her designee

■	One seat for a high-level California State University, Fresno, representative (to
coordinate tourism with the University’s sports and academic programs which attract
thousands of visitors to this area each year)

*	One seat for transportation [to be rotated annually between the Fresno Yosemite
International Airport (which has the ability to obtain grants for tounsm promotion),
Amtrak, and the motor coach service that brings the most in-bound tour groups to Fresno
County]

■	One seat for a national parks representative (appointed by the Superintendent of Sequoia
Kings Canyon National Park, could be a Park Service employee or a vendor like
Delaware North Parks Services, the concessionaire with the largest economic incentive to
attract tourists to the national parks)

■	Two seats for other incorporated cities in Fresno County to be rotated among or selected
by the incorporated cities, cities eligible to participate on the Authority board must meet
minimum qualifications that will be established when the Authority is created (the criteria
will include, among other things, an already exiting city TOT tax, a minimum number of
lodging rooms, a minimum number of restaurants, and a minimum number of tourist
attractions)

■	One private sector seat representing lodging*

■	One private sector seat representing travel agents (who are willing to package tours for
the region and whose businesses include an emphasis on inbound as opposed to outbound
travel)*

*	One private sector seat representing attractions*

■	Two at-large private sector seats (a representative from Shaver Lake, perhaps, or other
industry sectors)*

This creates a 13-member Board with 5 seats reserved for the private sector

* The five private sector seats will be filled by appointment made by the public sector seats on

the Authority’s Board Individuals who want to represent the private sector on the Authority

Board will submit applications for consideration by the public sector Authority Board

- 7-

members The applications wjJI include the individual’s qualifications, commitment to
community stewardship, and the ability to contribute to the Authority's broader tourism
vision rather than an interest in self-promotion

When creating the Authority, the duties and responsibilities of the RTVA Board must be
specified along with the qualifications for private sector Board members and the exact
mechanism by which the pnvate sector can apply for and be appointed to seats on the RTVA
The RTVA would also need to contract with Fresno County for purposes of spending the special
tourism TLC as collected by the County Since the RTVA will be using public funds, it must be
accountable to all public sector participants, those in the tourism industry, and the community as
a whole

Proposed Operations

During its start-up, the RTVA would contract with Fresno County for the two employees
currently operating the Fresno County Office of Tounsm This would give the RTVA some
initial staff support However, it would be up to the RTVA Board of Directors to determine if
the contractual relationship with Fresno County should be continued The RTVA Board might
decide the most economical approach would be the continued use of Fresno County office space
and employees Alternatively, the RTVA Board might decide it would be more appropriate to
find its own office space and hire its own employees

The downside to the current fast-track approach the RJI is using is the lack of time to work out
all the details The upside is creation of a new entity with no historic baggage that can enhance
what limited tourism efforts currently exist and capitalize on making the TLC specifically
dedicated to tourism rather than going into the County’s general fund or being pursued by others
who want tax revenues at the industry’s expense

Conclusion

The RJI has made rapid progress Meetings have been held with all 5 members of the Board of
Supervisors as well as all Fresno City Council members and the Mayor of Clovis and Clovis City
Manager Now, we need to connect with a broader segment of the travel and hospitality industry
to obtain as much private sector input and support as possible The more industry support, the
better our chances of getting a TLC measure passed and regional tourism marketing underway
The end result will be the creation of more jobs and the enhancement of existing businesses even
during a sluggish tourism economy because we have nowhere to go but up

PRELIMINARY RESEARCH FOR THIS REPORT

After researching various tourism models, the following funding mechanisms were identified as
being used by peer counties in California

RTVA Funding Options

Funding Source	Advantage	Disadvantage
Membership dues to join and remain members of a tourism association (like the CVB)	Membership is voluntary, reliance on public assistance is minimal or non-existent, the private sector drives tourism marketing and promotion	Some businesses don’t have the resources or interest in paying membership dues; businesses that DO pay dues want to control marketing to their benefit at the expense of regional collaboration/ funding based on membership dues fluctuates making longer-term campaigns risky, membership renewals often decline in poor economies, member recruitment is always a challenge, associations tend to be less innovative because committees are often “risk adverse ” Depending on the association, there is no guarantee that some or all of the members’ dues will be used exclusively to promote tourism
Public-private  partnerships	The Fresno County Office of Tourism is using this model to fund promotion of the new Fresno County Fruit Trail This approach will also be used to fund marketing of Fresno County golf packages Private “partners” pay to participate in specific promotional efforts.	As with the association model, some businesses may not have the resources or interest in participating*, selling private partnerships is a slow and time consuming process and funds raised seldom cover the full costs of the specific project There is also the potential that excess funds raised, if any, could be siphoned off into the County’s general fund This model, alone, will leave Fresno County well behind peer tourism competitors and is not likely to realize the rapid creation of jobs that a well- funded broader RTVA could deliver

* A goal of the RJJ is to encourage the creation of new business which will also create new jobs, new start-up
businesses often can least afford membership dues or the costs of participation in public-private partnerships
yet they need promotional assistance the most

-n-

RTVA Funding Options (continued)

Funding Source	Advantage	Disadvantage
Uniform countywide Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) on lodging facilities in the County’s unincorporated areas2	This would provide a steady funding stream that is linked to overnight visitors, the more visitors who stay overnight, the greater the revenues for future tourism promotion, approximately $800,000 was generated by Fresno County’s 8% TOT tax at the time it was abolished in 1996	A uniform TOT tax applied to unincorporated areas of the county might not benefit properties in remote areas as much as those located in downtown Fresno (unless the RTVA focuses on marketing outlying communities) Tourism stakeholders do not want TOT taxes to go into the County’s general fund, instead, they prefer that TOT taxes be used to increase occupancy levels Properties that book rooms on the “American plan” months in advance are concerned the immediate imposition of TOT taxes would directly impact their bottom lines
Benefit Assessment District TOT tax on aJJ lodging facilities in the incorporated and unincorporated areas of Fresno County3	As with the uniform County TOT tax, this would provide a steady and significant funding stream that is linked to overnight visitors In this model, TOT taxes would be highest for downtown properties and lowest for properties in outlying areas based on an assumption that downtown properties would receive the highest level of benefit from conventions and tourism promotion This premise probably works best in an area like Sacramento where numerous conventions are attracted to interact with the State legislature and downtown tourist destinations like “Old Town Sacramento” already exist	TOT taxes based on zones of benefit would generate considerably more than the $800,000 the County was receiving in 1996 However, funding by zones of benefit could give the RTVA an incentive to promote downtown businesses at the expense of outlying areas, thereby defeating the concept of a regional effort Jn addition, this would require Fresno County and its 15 incorporated cities to agree on a benefit assessment district funded by TOT taxes, in Fresno County, this could be a hard sell since some cities have no TOT tax while TOT taxes in other cities are as high as 10%  A modified version of the Benefit Assessment District TOT tax could be applied to the unincorporated areas of the County only but this would be likely to generate considerably less than the $800,000 the County was receiving in 1996

2	Fresno County is one of only 5 counties in California that does not charge a TOT tax in its unincorporated

areas Kern County’s TOT tax is 6%

J Sacramento County uses this approach In 2001, approximately $2 1 million was generated annually in the
City of Sacramento while SI million was generated in the unincorporated areas of Sacramento County

RTVA Funding Options (continued)

Funding Source	Advantage	Disadvantage
Benefit Assessment District on all tourism stakeholders (possibly similar to the Arts To Zoo measure of the mid 1990s)	TOT taxes place the burden of tounsm promotion on lodging facilities despite others who benefit from tounsm (transportation and tour bus operators, attractions without associated lodging, restaurants, and similar businesses) It might be possible to create a broader Benefit Assessment District or sales tax to generate revenue for tourist attractions (like the arts and zoo) as well as the RTVA Such a broad brush approach would insure that many of Fresno County’s attractions are adequately funded into the future as components that attract tourism	Obtaining 67% of voter approval for this type of broad benefit assessment district or a sales tax increase might not be palatable to today’s voters given competing priorities like public safety This might be a longer-term strategy for the RTVA to consider once it has a proven track record and has regained the trust of the tourism industry

RTVA Structural Options:

Options	Advantages	Disadvantages
Establish the RTVA as a function of the CVB	The CVB already exists and to some extent, has a stake in tourism. Fresno County has contracted with the CVB to create the Fresno County Office of Tourism Fresno County’s financial commitment to the Office of Tourism is $200,000 annually. Fresno County’s contract with the CVB is up for renewal on June 30, 2004	The CVB does not have a track record of promoting tourism on a regional basis A declining number of members pay CVB dues because they don’t perceive value for their membership investment This is especially true for tourism stakeholders in outlying areas of Fresno County  In 2002, the CVB Board chose not to implement an internal restructuring recommended in the Sprague report The restructuring would have put tourism on equal footing with conventions For many tourism stakeholders, this decision confirmed the CVB’s primary commitment to conventions rather than tourism

RTVA Structural Options:

Options	Advantages	Disadvantages
Wait for the SMG transition to see the affect on the CVB’s future direction	SMG may increase the focus on tourism to meet contractual convention obligations with the City of Fresno and the Save Mart Center, SMG may want to promote tourism in the region to benefit all San Joaquin Valley facilities managed by SMG	Several agencies report that SMG does not participate in public-private partnerships to promote regional tourism; the agencies are usually responsible for providing SMG with pre and post conference tourism information to present to convention attendees, m addition, any potential RJI momentum that could move the Tourism Cluster forward will be delayed if this Cluster waits to see what happens with SMG over the next 12 to 18 months
Create an RTVA association	This model is based on tourism stakeholders paying annual membership dues to fund tourism promotion .	This places the burden on those tourism stakeholders who are committed to the broader benefit of the community Non-dues payers (especially start-up businesses) might not be able to afford membership but still need the promotion to grow and create jobs
Create a new public- private RTVA with a 13- to 23-member Board of Directors The Board would be comprised of 7- to 19- public sector seats and 3- to 4- private sector seats Using the  “Community Values of the Fresno Region,” attempt to detach funding levels from voting power on the Board	Fresno County and cities that are already involved in tourism promotion would serve as the public sector seats on this new RTVA Private sector seats would be filled either by public sector appointment or by industry election. As a completely new entity, the trust of tourism stakeholders could be regained since the focus would be exclusively on promotion of regional tourism in all areas of the County	It will be necessary to obtain the “buy in” of all public sectors envisioned to hold seats on the RTVA Board and to select private sector leaders for the public seats on the RTVA Board The RTVA Board members must contribute in positive ways to restore the tourism industry’s trust and to develop long-term sustainable funding for the RTVA

Conclusion

The most effective model for an RTVA is the creation of a new public-private entity that is
founded on the '‘Community Values For the Fresno Region” from its inception This is a
massive undertaking with many specific details yet to be worked out but it’s imperative that the
RJI create this new entity as quickly as possible Given the shortness of time, some concepts for
discussion and consideration are presented below

-14-

RTVA Organizational Considerations

Item	Considerations
RTVA Name	To obtain the “buy in” of many stakeholders, a broad based name is preferable Some have suggested simply Regional Tourism and Visitors Authority” so the entity can expand to include surrounding counties at some point in the future if appropriate Or, as recommended in the Sprague report to leverage the County’s proximity to Yosemite, the name could be the “Fresno Yosemite Sequoia Kings Canyon Regional Tourism and Visitors Authority. ”
Formation  deadline	If the RTVA can be formed before June 30, 2004, the new RTVA could contract with Fresno County to obtain the $200,000 in funding that is currently going to the CVB for the Fresno County Office of Tourism, this would allow the Fresno County Office of Tourism to continue its current efforts to promote the Fruit Trail, launch golf marketing packages, and pursue other private-public partnerships that could generate revenue for the new RTVA without the constraints of CVB approval and politics
Other Industry Participation	The Fresno County Office of Tourism has created an active Tourism Committee This Committee could be broadened and expanded to encourage greater industry participation with the new RTVA
Initial Funding	Contract with Fresno County to obtain the services of the Fresno County Office of Tourism starting July 1, 2004, discussion with public Board members regarding potential for even nominal funding from city budgets, establishment of memberships for chambers of commerce and private sector businesses that want to see the RTVA succeed in promotion of regional tourism, concierge service with referral fees and commissions, grants
Long-Term  Funding	Implement a uniform TOT tax in the County’s unincorporated areas Ordinance must be passed by the end of July to qualify for the November ballot All voters in the County can vote on this measure and 67% must vote in favor to pass With support from the RTVA and its component cities where the majority of voting power exists, there are many ways to make the case in favor of the TOT tax for the voters Most cities already have TOT taxes so why shouldn’t the County? The proposed new TOT tax is really restoring a tax that was eliminated in 1996 to the County’s detriment The proposed new TOT tax will not affect voters but rather, will generate revenues from visitors to the County who stay overnight The tax will be used to create jobs and bring more tourism to our region. The tax will not go into any agency’s general fund but rather, will be used exclusively to promote tourism However, the TOT tax might face a better chance in an election other than the general election where a variety of new taxes are likely to be proposed.
	If the TOT tax passes in November, the RTVA can look at other alternatives for funding such as a broader benefit assessment district or even a sales tax depending on the economic and politic environment in the future at a more leisurely pace

RTVA Organizational Considerations

Item	Considerations
Marketing Plan Which Comes First, the Chicken or the Egg	To sell properties on supporting a uniform countywide TOT tax, the RTVA may need a marketing plan that demonstrates how tourism will be promoted in all areas of the County This plan would also serve as the basis for guiding future marketing and promotional efforts to attract tourists to the area Depending on the initial formation of the RTVA, it might be possible to obtain enough public sector support to prepare a more specific (and visual) marketing plan compared to the more general Sprague report. In the absence of public sector funding for a tourism marketing plan, the Tourism Cluster might include this in an RJI “ask” or might have to look for other creative ways to fund a marketing plan If a TOT tax in the unincorporated areas of the County does NOT pass in November, the Tourism Cluster will have to focus on getting a ballot measure passed in 2006 This would involve extensive voter outreach to get the 67% vote required
Uniform  “branding”?	SMG will be producing collateral materials to market the Convention Center, it is vital that the RTVA and SMG collaborate to insure uniform “branding” and distribution of aligned tourism messages and marketing

Travel Industry

California Tourism's Contributions to the California Economy: 1998-2002

As the number one travel destination in the United States, California annually generates more
than S75 billion in direct travel spending into the economy, directly supports jobs for more
than 1 million Californians and generates $5 billion in direct state and local tax revenue.

Tourism is California's 3rd largest employer and 5th largest contributor to the gross state product
Since 1998 when Governor Davis took office, the new California Tounsm program (a joint
marketing venture of the California Travel and Tounsm Commission and the California Division of
Tounsm) has reversed a decade-long decline in domestic market share and billions of dollars in lost
travel related revenue and jobs for California For the last four successive years, California has
increased market share against aggressively competing states with significantly larger budgets from
9 7 percent to 11 6 percent, resulting in an additional $8 7 billion in visitor spending infused into the
California economy, creating 120,833 California jobs, and approximately $539 million in direct tax
revenue

In fact, California was one of only three states to grow market share in 2001 due in large part to the
highly leveraged $25 million post 9/11 tounsm recovery campaign initiated by California Tounsm
The California Tounsm program has become so successful in creating economic growth, it has
become a model for the nation The State again, has the unique opportunity to stimulate the economy
by aggressively promoting California as the destination of choice among prospective travelers
Following are highlights of the enormously successful marketing endeavors conducted by California
Tounsm that directly stimulated increased travel and related expenditures for the state

Marketing & Advertising

Since 1998 and the passage of the California Tounsm Marketing Act, the purchasing power of the
state’s annual $7 3 million tounsm budget coupled with the CTTCs $6 8 million in funding has
provided seed funding to generate over $80 million in cooperative partner funds to promote travel to
California Cooperative funding was developed from pnvate and other governmental sources in every
major category of California Tounsm's program This unique public/pnvate partnership not only has
allowed California Tounsm to retain a competitive edge in the global marketplace, but to create the
most progressive marketing program in the nation

Adventures in Wild California IMAX Campaign

California Tourism conceived and produced a large-format/IMAX film. Adventures m Wild
California, to communicate the state's allure and magnificence to the world The IMAX concept was
created after researchers discovered more than 350 IMAX theaters worldwide, many in California’s
target markets As of October 31, 2002, Adventures in Wild California has played in 65 cities on five
continents worldwide and a syndicated three-hour "made for TV" version aired in an additional 140
countries, reaching nearly 1 billion households The $500,000 California Tounsm investment in seed
funding has been leveraged into a $30 million marketing effort.

In-State Marketing Campaign with ’’Best of California” Television

To respond to the dramatic decrease in travel spending after September 11, 2001, California Tounsm

http //www visitcalifomia com/state/tounsm/tour htmlpnnt )sp?iOID=39303&sTableName 07/26/04

Welcome to calitomia

f d£C Z. VI *

developed and launched a new comprehensive campaign designed to get Californians to rediscover
their great State The campaign included the production of three 30-second television spots, eight 60-
second radio spots, nine newspaper spreads m major metropolitan newspapers, the creation of a
"California Finds" Web site providing added value travel packages to the consumer, and
development of 13 half-hour "Best of California" television programs that reached 7 8 million
targeted households A total of $5 million was leveraged into a $25 million m-state marketing effort
A study of this campaign showed a return on investment of $143 for each dollar spent
Expenditures by visitors influenced to travel by the in-state advertising campaign totaled $1.48
billion, created 19,444 jobs, and generated tax revenues totaling $51.9 million during the
promotional period. Independent research shows that travel was up 3 percent despite the
effects of September 11.

Interactive Television Development

Building on the success of Adventures in Wild California IMAX, California Tourism continued
development of its five-year plan to launch interactive TV programming with exclusive features on
California The plan includes a second season of the "Best of California" television senes and an
interactive "Best of California" Web site that will feature show topics and bookable partner vacation
packages This new pioneenng program will soon reach a global targeted audience of millions 24
hours a day, seven days a week

Advertising

Over the past four years, California Tounsm has invested $12 5 million in national advertising in
both television and print mediums to keep California "top of mind" as consumers make their vacation
decision The national, award-winning campaign has targeted out-of-state consumers with innovative
creative executions, capturing the free-spirited attitude and lifestyle that people worldwide want to
become a part of, if only for a vacation Each year the campaign averaged a 4 to 1 return on
investment (ROI) in tax dollars. For example, a study conducted of the 2001 advertising
campaign established that California Tourism's ads influenced 3.6 million visitors in 2001.
These visitors spent $2.6 billion. The cost of the advertising campaign was $4.4 million, leading
to a return of $196 for each $1 spent This investment also generated an estimated $6.88 in
taxes for each $1 spent, or a total of $91 million in state taxes.

Cooperative Marketing Efforts

In order to respond to specific consumer interests while vacationing, California Tounsm also
developed activity-based promotions including California Fun Spots (theme parks and attractions),
Culture California, Dine California, Golf California, California (Outdoor) Recreation, California
Snow, the AARP Family Savings Card, Wild Vacations in California and a cooperative pnnt
promotion with American Express to drive consumers to choose California product Leveraged
promotional activities include pnnt publications, creation of activity-specific Web sites, participation
in trade shows, added value card promotions as well as other tactical elements California Tourism
has provided seed funding of nearly $5.5 million over the past four years and industry
participation has leveraged that investment conservatively into a 4 to 1 or $20 million
cooperative marketing effort, due to the over 300 industry partners involved.

Welcome to California

rage j oi /

California Tourism's visitor information program continues to be an important contributor to the
health of the State's economy Whether in- or out-of-state, visitors and potential visitors rely on
California Tourism as their primary information source

Literature/Fulfillment Program Return on Investment

Since 1999, on average, the literature/fulfillment program annually generated $119 million in total
spending to the state Visitor spending, strengthened by the program, generated $4.7 million in
new State tax revenues. And for every $1 spent, California received $174 6 from travelers who
decided to visit or extended their stay because they receive the information

Publications Program/California Visitor’s Guide

Completely funded by advertising sales, the publications program has generated approximately
$250,000 in revenue back into California Tourism for further marketing purposes.

California Tourism Web Site

The www visitcalifomia.com Web site has literally created a window to the world for small and large
California businesses seeking prospective travelers by offering users a plethora of exciting travel
activities and places to see The site had more than 9,644,498 user sessions and 3,163,766 unique
visitors from 1998-2002 In addition, requests for visitor packets from www.visitcalifornia.com
increased 161% since 1999.

Official California Welcome Centers

Since the program’s inception in 1994, California Welcome Centers have acted as the number one
visitor stop for domestic and international travelers once they are within the state Supplying valuable
traveler information and visitor services to nearly 3 million international and domestic tourists since
1998, average visitation to the Centers has increased 21 percent annually In the spring of 2003, the
network of welcome centers will offer an official Web site and hotel reservation system enabling 24-
hour visitor access to these services Recognized as one of the most efficient operations in the nation,
the California Welcome Center Program is administered by California Tounsm that sets standards for
operation The network of 11 centers is financially supported entirely by local partner funding and
operates at no cost to the State

Qmn^ynicationa

The primary role of California Tourism's Communications Program is to generate positive coverage
for California in an effort to encourage visitation to the Golden State Since 1998, the
Communications Program have initiated contact with, or responded to, nearly 11,000 media,
resulting in California coverage with an estimated media value of $35 million. Program
highlights include

Overseas Public Relations Offices

In 2001, California Tourism, for the first time ever, contracted for public relations representation in
Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom Media outreach includes daily contact with key travel
media, press trips, media missions, press releases and newsletters, and participation in travel trade

shows The combined efforts of the three overseas public relations operations have resulted in
contact with nearly 4,600 journalists, resulting in California coverage valued at $13 million.

California Tourism’s Media Missions

Since 1998, an average of 42 delegates representing California destinations, attractions, tour
companies, accommodations, shopping areas, and ski resorts have participated in California
Tourism's annual media mission to New York City One of the biggest events of its kind, more than
100 consumer and travel trade press have attended the evening reception and marketplace featuring
themes and special guests such as 150lh Anniversary of Gold Discovery with Dr Kevin Starr,
Adventures in Wild California IMAX film debut, and California Fusion - Culture and Cuisine with
celebrity chef Martin Yan Publicity highlights resulting from mission include a segment on The
Today Show featuring Chef Martin Yan, valued at $500,000; and the May/June 2001 edition of
Saveur Magazine, dedicated exclusively to California, valued at $1.9 million (travel editor
gathered information at 2000 press event).

Crisis Communications

As part of the California, Find Yourself Here tourism recovery campaign implemented in response to
9/11, a national award-winning online program, "California Finds," featuring more than 1,200
packages for visitors, was begun From December 2001 through August 2002, the "California Finds"
site attracted 145,000 visitor sessions and 1 million hits In response to the energy challenges facing
California in 2001, California Tourism also initiated the nationally-recognized Enlighten
communications campaign The key message of the campaign was, "the lights are still on in
California " California Tourism additionally engaged in crisis response and provided informational
assistance to communities affected by El NiA/A±o flooding, chemical treatment of Lake Davis in
Plumas County, and wildfires throughout the state

Media Outreach

Primary media outreach tools include press and feature releases, such as the quarterly What's New in
California, which is mailed to 3,000 writers, editors and broadcasters worldwide What's New items
are used regularly by the Associated Press (AP), and go to 1,550 daily AP member newspapers
around the country, representing 98 8 percent of all U S dailies and 99 percent of U S newspaper
circulation During the past four years, California Tourism has organized numerous individual and
group press tnps for domestic and international journalists, actively entered the competitive
international marketplace by conducting media missions to Austria, Brazil, Germany, Japan, Mexico,
Switzerland, and the Umted Kingdom, and continued participation at key wnter conferences and
travel trade shows

Travel Trade Development

Travel Trade Development implements a wide range of marketing activities to promote California
both domestically and internationally, reaching tour operators, travel agents, incentive organizers,
meeting planners and group travel planners Travel Trade Development provides exposure of
California as a premier travel destination to increase group and independent tour package sales to the
state and drive travel agent referrals to California, as opposed to competing destinations

educational seminars/workshops Joint promotions are conducted with major worldwide airlines and
domestic earners to increase awareness of California and dnve bookings California Tounsm's seed
money and 5 to 1 leveraged cooperative funding from tounsm partners throughout the state have
made it possible for California Tourism and industry partners to participate in more than 300 trade
shows in the past four years

International Travel Trade Offices

In the past four years, California Tourism has expanded international reach with the opening of new
travel trade offices in Brazil and Australia in addition to the already successful offices in the UK,
Germany and Japan These overseas offices are vital to maintaining and increasing California’s
market share and visibility in their respective regions to keep California the number one destination
for international travelers to the U S These offices have made more than 125,000 contacts with trade
and consumers in the past four years California Tounsm's seed money is coupled with funding from
convention and visitor bureaus throughout the state to leverage support from the industry to provide a
greater, more impactful presence

International Ski Program

California Tounsm and the California Ski Industry Association have cooperatively conducted an
aggressive winter sports consumer campaign in the UK and Ireland, together with Virgin Atlantic
Airways Since the onset, packaged Bntish ski visitors have increased from approximately 1,000 to

12,000	per year With this aggressive promotional effort, California overtook Colorado as the number
one ski destination in the U S The benefit, as much as $24 million in a good season, is a
tremendous boost to tourism throughout the California ski community.

"A Taste of California"

The vast diversity of the Golden State has offered California Tounsm the opportunity to develop and
promote "A Taste of California" element into programs "Taste of California" is a branding for a
variety of different food-related cooperative programs from special chef events to food product
samples in conjunction with trade shows By branding "A Taste of California," California Tourism
can emphasize the whole "lifestyle" concept of California, which no other destination can claim By
featuring California food products that are available in-market in conjunction with tourism locations,
and working with commodity boards, California's "home-grown" products such as pistachios and
wild nee provide a highly compelling sales platform for tours and export This theme has created a
pioneering marketing opportunity that no other state has been able to match

California Countryside Marketing Fund Program

With the decline of extractive industries in rural California, local leaders have turned to tourism
development as an economic and job stimulus in response to the current environment Each of the
eight designated rural tourism regions in California is granted $25,000 per year to market the region
as a tourism destination Rural Regional Marketing Organizations utilize the funds to participate in
domestic and international travel trade shows, to produce regional visitor's guides, to develop and
maintain regional Web sites, and to purchase advertising Much of this marketing would not take
place without the Countryside funds, as resources are few in these areas However, through this
innovative program, an average of 428,000 contacts are made each year, at an average cost of
$0.47 per contact.

Tourism Research

California Tourism's Research Program maintains a long-standing annual report series that details the
impact of travel and tourism on the state Travel volume reports include Domestic Travel to
California, Overseas Visitors to California, and reports on travelers from specific countries Travel
Impacts by County details the expenditures of travelers by county, and statewide statistics on the
economic impact of travel and tourism The summaiy publication Fast Facts provides an overview of
these statistics The established research base created by this annual report senes enables California
Tounsm to track the massive impact of travel and tourism on California's economy

The information in these reports is constantly called for and used by travel industry professionals, the
media, destination marketing organizations throughout the state, realtors, local and state legislators,
students and educators in the U S and other countnes, and the Travel Industry Association of
America Thousands of copies of these reports are provided to inquirers electronically and in hard
copy each year

Conclusion

Given the current effectiveness of the program and the ability to sustain the current base budget level
of approximately $14 million ($7 3 million State general fund/$6 8 million California Travel and
Tourism Commission), it is projected that the program can generate approximately 100,000 new
travel and hospitality jobs over the next four-year period

Should the program be drastically reduced or forced to rely solely on the CTTC operating budget,
California will again be faced with the devastating downward decline in market share similar to what
occurred during the early to mid 1990s before the new California Tounsm program began in 1998
From 1996-1998 for example, California went from 10 1 percent market share to 9 7 percent market
share, resulting in loss of 24,000 jobs, $1 72 billion in tounsm spending and $106 8 million in direct
tax revenue

Colorado experienced similar negative results when the State ceased to promote itself as a travel
destination From 1993 to 1997 Colorado’s share of domestic pleasure travel dropped a dramatic 30
percent Colorado dropped from first place among states in the "summer resort category" to 17th, and
has not made the top ten since that time As well, California overtook Colorado as the number one
skier visit destination during this period Due to the devastating economic impacts to the state -
particularly in rural regions - Colorado has since restored its tourism marketing program to help make
up the approximate annual loss of $2 4 billion in foregone tourism spending and $134 million in
direct tax revenue

Case studies and research has shown that investing in tounsm marketing for a destination has an
immediate positive effect of generating new spending and jobs for an economy California Tourism,
heralded as a national model, is ideally positioned to make significant contnbutions to the California
economy in both the short-term and long into the future It is for this reason that every state in the
country has an aggressive tourism marketing effort Without the State of California's general fund
contribution to the overall budget, California would fall from 13th to 33rd amongst all states in
investment of a sustainable tounsm marketing effort

CITY OF CLOVIS TOURISM STRATEGY

June 30, 2004

Somewhere centuries ago a community decided to celebrate, and a festival was bom
Quick thinking merchants saw the “new” people coming to the festival and attractively
displayed their wares Townsfolk realized that visitors from afar would need places to
rest Someone knew enough to organize the event and, if that person was a visionary,
he knew that revelers would pay to watch the sun go down, that is if accompanying food
and music were provided

Visitors beat new paths to the community Paths turned into roads Vendors decided
that the festival was sustainable, so they stayed on, calling the place where they
gathered to do business the market The community now had a commercial center
Dwellings that offered hospitality became inns and eating-places The sun was reliable
in its setting Tourism was bom.

The model described has not changed over time It is a simple model of tounsm
development Add the production of the goods that the vendors offer for sale, then
create a strategy for community development that includes local manufacturing, and the
practice of economic development, as we know it today, becomes definitive

Many people believe that tourism is a service industry that takes care of visitors when
they are away from home Some restrict the definition of tourism by number of miles
away from home, overnight stays in paid accommodations, or travel for the purpose of
pleasure or leisure Others think that travel and tounsm should not even be referred to
as an industry.

Tounsm opportunities are always community-based If the tourist is traveling to a
community to simply spend time in that community (as opposed to going for a particular
event), that travel can be called cultural tounsm What makes cultural tounsm unique is
that people go to absorb and expenence the culture of a place "Place’1 is a destination
with a story to tell to a visitor

Whatever the official definition of tounsm may be, it seems to boil down to one important
factor Capturing disposable money from customers who have an option to spend
it elsewhere

Tounsm can be broken down into four distinct categones They are as follows

1.	Tourism Retention

Providing opportunities for Clovis residents to spend disposable money in the
City of Clovis

2.	Immediate Tourism

Providing opportunities for neighboring residents (people who live within 50 miles
outside of Clovis) to spend disposable money

Clovis City Tounsm Strategy

1

3.	Intermediate Destination Tourism

Providing opportunities for Clovis to serve as an intermediate tounst destination.

►	Many people travel to various destinations and must travel through or near
the City of Clovis By providing an opportunity for them to spend
disposable money in Clovis, we become an intermediate tounst
destination

4.	End Destination Tourism

Providing opportunities for Clovis to serve as an end destination for tounst.

►	. By hosting and housing events and attractions, the City of Clovis will

appeal to people who will travel to, and temporarily stay in, Clovis

THE TOURISM INFRASTRUCTURE

Infrastructure is made up of places and things that are the components of
accommodation It may be something that the visitor doesn't notice or see, unless it is
missing -the same things that attract industrial prospects, such as reliable utilities or
good roads Infrastructure is what a visitor senses as he makes his decision to linger or
return Security and hospitality are two critical infrastructure components that someone
passing through a community must sense before he will consider conversion to tounst

The tourism infrastructure, just like any other infrastructure, is built from the ground up
The more infrastructure that is in place, the more tourism it can support Following are
the 15 Key Elements of a strong and successful tounsm infrastructure

1	Attractive/Appealing Community

2	Friendly and Inviting Merchants/Residents/Public Groups

3	Easy Access

4	Safe Community

5	Gas Stations and Other Services

6	Clean Restrooms

7	Restaurants and Bars

8	Shops and Stores

9.	Attractions/Events/Activities

10.	Arts/Cultural Attractions/Historic Attractions

11	Lodging

12	Collateral Matenal

13	Targeted Advertising

14	Broad Advertising

15	Other Advertising

All of these components are not necessary for tounsm Tounsm can exist with a single
element Of course, the tourism industry grows exponentially every time one of these
elements is added

Clovis City Tounsm Strategy

2

The whole community must realize the importance of the tounst They must all get on
board with the idea of developing the community as a tounst attraction and must work
together to make the community attractive and appealing One of the easiest ways to
meet this goal is for merchants to be friendly and inviting The merchants must
understand that the customer is the most important thing that his or her business
possesses Likewise, the merchant must do everything possible to make his or her
store attractive and clean to the potential customer

A Valk-around area" descnbes an area where travelers stop and linger in communities
because they offer an inviting environment, such as a themed business district or
revitalized main-street Visitors who return are attracted to the ambiance of an area or
place Providing an infrastructure, walking areas and convenient parking, to move
visitors around as pedestrians is a recognized technique for converting visitors to
tounsts Of equal importance is the provision for easy access to cultural, hentage and
recreational attractions Convenient access is essential, also, the streets and paths that
lead to and from all attractions must be safe, clean and inviting

Access to the community must be available, easy to navigate, and free of penis. In
other words, a community that wishes to attract tourist must make it easy for the tourists
to get there

The community must do everything in its power to protect the tourist from danger At all
times, the tourist must feel safe

Of course, gas stations and other services that support the traveler (and the traveler's
automobile) generally make the potential customer exit the freeway and take a look at
the community

Fast food franchise operators and gas station owners are smart They realize that if they
provide clean restrooms, a traveler is more likely to stop While using the facilities and
stretching their legs, they are likely to buy something. The traveler figures “hey, I’m
here anyway I’ll go ahead and fill up the tank why stop again later'?” or “while I’m
here I’ll get a quick bite to eat"

Restaurants and bars are the single most important attraction for tourism If people
are going to travel somewhere, they will eventually need to eat A vanety of
establishments are the cornerstone of any tourism program

Appealing shops, stores and boutiques will keep the tounst intngued and engaged
Whether they are shopping to find the perfect gift to remember their trip, shopping for a
souvenir for a loved one, or looking for that special item that is not available “back
home", the shops must be diverse and interesting. Shopping is a form of entertainment
for many people

Events, attractions and activities give people a reason to visit a community
Providing these attractions gives people a destination For example, people plan trips
to Disneyland, not Anaheim

Clovis City Tourism Strategy

3

It's also important to remember that not-for-profit attractions are a good way attract
tounsts and can be prosperous just like any other

Once lodging is available, a city is able to become an end destination instead of
settling on forever being an intermediate destination

Arts, cultural and historic attractions add a level of diversity, and credibility to any
tounsm program These elements help support sustainable tourrsm (on-going tourism -
that does not rely on a specific special event) Without arts, cultural and histone
attractions, a city falls into a category that is more like a roadside attraction “Visit the
deepest well in the world” or “See the giant walnut"

Relatively few traditional museums are operated as “for-profit" enterprises,
nevertheless, they are important as economic development entities that complete the
formula for success in attracting visitors to most communities

The term "loss leaders" is often applied in retail marketing to describe products that
businesses don't actually make a profit from, but are displayed to entice consumers to
shop and buy other products The community that attracts tounsts has loss leaders as
well A loss leader may be a museum or a cultural center A loss leader may be a
business placed behind a histone storefront and given incentives to operate there for
the good of the overall area's ambiance A loss leader may be public accommodations
and conveyances that make lingering in the community convenient and enjoyable

Collateral material such as brochures, maps, guides, and fliers, describe what is
available, when to experience it, how to get to it and why tounsts should go

Targeted advertising (qualitative) is an inexpensive way of reaching the most likely
customer Instead of trying to get the word out to everyone, tell the people who enjoy
what you have The City of Clovis has several antique shops in its Old Town area
Advertising to people who enjoy antiques makes since Adverting to everyone will
cause you to pay to reach people who enjoy racecars, archery, swimming, and a vanety
of other things It does not make sense unless you have something for everyone, if a
tounsm program may appeal to everyone than Broad advertising (quantitative) can be
used

Other advertising such as signage, specialized newsletters, and web advertising
should be evaluated and used on a case-by-case basis

FRESNO COUNTY TOURIST STATISTICS

WHY THE STATUS QUO ISN’T WORKING

Fresno County ranked 50 out of 58 counties in terms of growth in destination

spending over the past 10 years Madera County ranked 11th, Kings County ranked 16ttl, and
Tulare County ranked 27u>

In every year between 1992 and 2002, destination spending in Kern County exceeded
destination spending in Fresno County. In 2002, direct travel spending in Kern
County exceeded spending in Fresno County by S61 million. The irony is, of California’s
58 counties, Fresno County ranks 10u‘ in terms of population while Kern County ranks 14“

In 2002, Kern County had 13,200 travel related jobs while Fresno County had 11,540 travel
related jobs 4.2% of Kern County’s total employment is travel generated compared to Fresno
County’s 2.7%.

IS COMPETING WITH KERN COUNTY THE BEST WE CAN DO?

What’s Kern County doing that we’re not? Kern County has an
office of tourism with 6 full-time employees, an annual budget of
$420,000 for the office and a marketing budget of $120,000 per year.
This marketing budget is spent exclusively on tourism: the
Bakersfield Convention and Visitors Bureau is responsible for
marketing of conventions and sports packages.

What’s San Diego do that keeps them near the top of every positive
tourism indicator? The San Diego Convention and Visitors Bureau
receives 85% of its funding from the City of San Diego’s TOT tax.
50% of the San Diego CVB’s budget, or $8 million, is spent on
marketing tourism. The other 50%, or $8 million, is spent on
marketing conventions.

What the Regional Jobs Initiative Is Proposing

(and why)

Fresno County is forming a new non-profit corporation to
handle tourism on a regional countywide basis

A new organization is needed so the cities of Fresno and
Clovis (as well as other entities) will participate in funding
tourism (Fresno City would not “give” Fresno County
money to use for tourism although the City would contract
with a new organization in the same way it contracts with
the CVB)

Tourism funding commitments from Fresno County and the
cities of Fresno and Clovis are projected to be
approximately $450,000 annually

$450,000 is more than what the public sector in Fresno
County invests in tourism today; it is only half of what the
public sector in Kern County invests in tourism today

Fresno County had a Travelers Lodging Charge (better
known as a “transient occupancy tax” or “hotel/motel bed
tax”) until 1996 that raised $800,000; hotels and motels in
the County’s unincorporated area prospered and grew when
the tax was in effect and

The RJI is proposing the County put the Travelers Lodging
Charge (TLC) on the November, 2004, ballot as a “special”
tax that could only be used for tourism; such a “special” tax
requires a 2/3 vote of the public and must be on a general
election (November) ballot

The TLC would ONLY apply to hotels, motels, and RV
parks in the County’s unincorporated area

If voters do not pass the TLC in November, 2004, the next
opportunity for a “special” tax dedicated to tourism would
be November, 2006

What the Regional Jobs Initiative Is Proposing

(and why)

It is estimated that a tourist spends a minimum of $30 per
day when traveling; this translates into $230 in sales tax per
day per tourist. Increasing the number of tourists benefits
local businesses AND local governments by generating
additional sales tax revenue

Many local governments give lip service to economic
development but don’t adequately fund it; yet, tourism is a
key component of economic development as evidenced by
Governor Schwarzenegger’s support and starring role in
new television commercials promoting California to tourists

Unique Qualities and Offerings

All of the benchmark destinations are American cities with a primary focus on
tourism However, each site has a set of unique qualities that appeal to visitors in
distinctive ways

Colonial Williamsburgf	A living Revolutionary era town, where visitors learn through

Busch Gardens	an	interactive expenence of major historical events and of

the lifestyles of the period A short drive away from Colonial
Williamsburg, Busch Gardens is the most extensive family
fun theme park in the Northeastern US

Branson	A	gathering	point	for many of the most famous American

musical talents of past decades, who perform nightly at
theaters they have "retired" to, at the sunset of their careers

Orlando	An	endless	bonanza	of	delights	for	the	family,	with parks,

rides, museums, concerts, sporting, cuisine, and the
growing list continues on. to include almost all imaginable
leisure activities

Las Vegas	The	sine	qua non of lavish spectacle, opulence, and

gambling-oriented entertainment

South and includes gambling as an integral part of this
experience

Common Styles of Origin and Development

But there is far greater learning value m understanding the shared characteristics and
marketing methods among these destinations To begin with, each of the sites
started from humble origins, with few natural advantages, and grew into first-tier
destinations in the US

	Origin	Today
Colonial Williamsburg	A decaying historical town salvaged by the interest of a wealthy patron	The fourth-largest tourist attraction m the United States
Branson	A small, poor town in the Ozark Mountains region of Missouri Lake fishing and a mountain cave were its first tourist attractions	A town of 3000 people that hosts 6 million visitors per year
Orlando	A region of swampland, chosen by Disney because the land was inexpensive	The single largest tourist destination in the world Over 30 million visitors arrive at Orlando International Airport every year, with another 14 million arriving by alternate means
Las Vegas	Situated in the desert with no natural water supply of its own	The global leader of gambling and lavish entertainment The city hosts over 30 million visitors per year, including 3 3 million convention visitors
Biloxi	A depressed town passed over by history, situated m an under-developed stretch of the Gulf Coast	A rejuvenated city where 60% of new jobs are created by gaming revenues and per capita income is 5% above the Mississippi state average

Planning to Achieve Multiple Goals

Is it necessary for a city to have a marketing strategy for attracting tourism? If the city
aims to host tourists in a way that leads to economic growth while balancing the
needs of the citizens of the city, then a structured and coordinated approach - a
marketing strategy - is the optimal approach to achieving these goals

The benchmark tourist destinations are indeed accomplishing a diverse family of
public and private goals These goals come from citizens, businesses, and public
institutions, and are tunneled through marketing planning processes Planning that is
based on inputs from all interested parties, and that is informed with the best
available knowledge of the tourism market (including both consumers and tounst
industries such as airlines, etc), is the only way to achieve multiple goals
simultaneously

Five Critical Terms Defined

Best-practice destination marketing planning is structured around five primary
reference points the Tourist, the Destination, Tourism Services Suppliers, the
Citizen, and the Public-Private Interest Coordinator

1 the tourist: Defined in terms of the total needs and the total expenence desired by
a potential visitor The traveler is understood as someone who is seeking values such
as leisure, relaxation, fun, personal enrichment The tourist is most often traveling
with a family or partners, which gives rise to additional needs and wants
Furthermore, the tourist will consume a broad range of products and services dunng
the visit, all of which should offer an acceptable standard of quality The tourist also
wants choices, and sufficient information to make the best choices for him or herself

2.	the destination* An interconnected and complementary set of attractions, events,
services and products which together create a total expenence and value proposition
to visitors Within the picture of the total expenence, there is usually a balance of the
unique and the complementary - that is to say, interesting choices that together
create a fun, convenient and personally valuable visit As neighboring Colonial
Williamsburg and Busch Gardens illustrate, attractions in close proximity can be
mutually supportive -- by offering nice choices for a vacationing family -- even though
they differ thematically In a successful destination, each attraction contributes
something to the total complementary demographics (Williamsburg ), incoming
tounst traffic (Las Vegas1 2), complementary styles and experiential values (Branson3)

1	Busch Gardens and Ihe Colonial Williamsburg Foundation have together realized that incoming
families generally want to visit both types of attractions, not just one or the other They have c.-eateo
joint-marketing programs, like the Revolutionary Fun package, that appeal to these families

2	Las Vegas's spectacular gambling casinos attract tounsts who actually spenc most of their money on
shopping and entertainment

A coordinated and consistent offering is not realized by accident, but instead through
careful management3 4

3 tourism services suppliers* Destination marketing is primarily accomplished by a
large group of independent firms and agencies that work together to sen/e their
independent interests Suppliers include both private sector firms (eg a hotel), and
public sector agencies (e g a public transportation department) Each private sector
firm will behave m a way that maximizes its own return on investment, while public
sector agencies will act to maximize the effectiveness of their resources and to
accomplish their legislative mandate But because of the essential interdependence
of the players in the tourism market5, destination tourism service suppliers should -
and do - attempt to coordinate their marketing activities Even so, private firms are
constrained from taking a long-term view of destination marketing by short-term profit
pressures and imperfect information 6 * 8 Coordination is difficult to sustain because of
the inherent difficulty involved in perceiving the connection between individual
contributions and individual 'returns This inspires the need for a specialized public-
private interest coordinator, who will not only coordinate strategy but also undertaKe
the expense of demonstrating the benefits of coordination It is this essential and
necessary expense that is most often forgotten when it is assumed that private firms
and agencies will coordinate tourist policies

4. the citizen The ultimate authority and beneficiary with regard to the development of
his or her home city The first mandate of destination marketing is to satisfy the long-
term needs and wants of its natural constituents the people who sustain the city and
give it life Citizens are asked to host visitors and to harmonize their city’s qualities

3	Branson's individual offerings work together to create a strong, coordinated value proposition live
country music shows, famous performers of past years, a fun and culturally ennchmg theme park, and
sporting and nature activities that are extremely well suited to the American Midwest target market

4	For example, the rejection of proposed gambling licensing in Branson demonstrates a senous decision
to preserve the character of the destination and to forgo the revenue and traffic growth which licensed
gambling would generate

' One of the special characteristics of the tourism market is that it is in the interest of a large number
suppliers to share the same customer E g . John Smith, a tourist coming to NYC, might get services
from an airline, one or more hotels, several museums, several restaurants, several retail stores, taxi
companies and public transportation companies, etc These various firms can optimize their profits or
other interests by together coordinating their complete 'marketing mixes' products and services, pricing,
promotion, placement (distnbution channels), etc

6 in general, negative externalities result from a single firm acting to serve its own best interests in a way
that indirectly causes adverse effects on the market There are many potential negative externalities that
can arise from the tourism industry pollution, intra-industry negative advertising, price gauging and
other monopolistic behaviors

A positive externality is a benefit derived from a firm's actions that the firm itself does not directly benefit
from providing To illustrate a 3-star restaurant opens m NYC. which especially attracts new visitors
seeking culinary experiences, airlines, hotels, anc other suppliers will benefit from the increased traffic,
but the restaurant itself is not directly rewardec for these positive effects it receives direct benefit only
from its own paying customers

with the needs and expectations of prospective visitors 7 What is tourism's reward to
the citizens7 Does it go beyond pure economics7 These issues are vital to successful
destination marketing, and the responsibility for handling these issues also falls to the
public-private interest coordinator (See also. Public - Private Sector Coordination A
Virtuous Circle for Economic Growth)

5. the public-private interest coordinator An organization that has the
responsibility to coordinate and facilitate the interests and actions of all the
concerned parties in destination marketing In other words, its job is to increase the
potential benefits available to all the parties Its duties are to

1)	Recognize and respond to all concerned parties

2)	Take a leading role in researching and analyzing the incoming-tourism market

3)	Identify positive and negative externalities in the market

4)	Inform all concerned parties of these externalities and facilitate the process of
innovating or legislating solutions for them

5)	Create positive externalities by undertaking the marketing activities for which
no other single party would have a sufficient return to provide on its own (e g ,
consumer research, development of the destination brand image,
communication, etc)

Fundamentally, the main roles of the public-private interest coordinator are
continuous and rapid learning about the tourism demand-supply market and effective
communication of the opportunities, threats and potential areas for coordination This
role cannot be fulfilled effectively either by the public sector or the private sector
acting independently Nonetheless, public and private sector interests are optimally
served when a third-party coordinator provides these services, therefore, both the
public and private sectors justifiably finance this service in conjunction with each
other (See also, Public - Pnvate Sector Coordination A Virtuous Circle for Economic
Growth)

Summary of Best Practices in Destination Marketing

Today’s most innovative practices in destination marketing are built on the five
above-mentioned conceptual reference points The continuation of this report
discusses these practices in detail, and we list some of them here

Best Practice Developing a powerful and unique value proposition to urge
tounsts to select the city over numerous alternatives Colonial
Williamsburg asks Americans to go on the "most important vacation
you'll ever take "

7 A citizen walking arouno his home city can easily observe many of the usual results of tourism (both
good and not-so-good) more restaurants, better maintained museums, higher prices at - for example -
hotels, increased numbers of people on the streets and at particular attractions, more-crowced buses,
etc The indirect benefits are also significant but not so easy for a citizen to observe cn his own
increased employment in the city, greater revenue for businesses anc the public-sector

Best Practice	Branding the value proposition in a communications program that is substantial and consistent Orlando is the far-and-away leader in creating share of mind as well as share of heart throughout the entire world
Best Practice	Visitor profiling to understand the tourist consumer's preferences, and purchasing behavior Disney is the leader in this practice, using a resort credit card to track the consumption patterns of individual visitors
Best Practice	Generating cost and time savings through visitor activity packages that include admission to several attractions over a period of several days Busch Gardens’ marketing program shows how such packages can be extremely successful, in this case by offering a crucial convenience for families whose working parents do not have time to research a trip
Best Practice	Providing for the education of tourism partners (citizens, institutions, airlines, hotels, etc} and the facilitation of coordination Best practice destinations strive to create a win-win situation for the beneficianes of tounsm The Las Vegas Convention and Visitor's Bureau was established - and is cooperatively funded - - as a focal point for much of the city’s tourism marketing activities
Best Practice	Perennially laboring to improve the diversity of the destination's offerings The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation and neighboring Busch Gardens have spearheaded a cooperative effort in the region to create fun choices for visitors, some of whom might really love history, while others have a deeper appreciation for watersJides!
Best Practice	Creating compelling reasons to visit in the off-season Branson has a harsh climate in its wintertime, but its destination marketers have created offerings that attract full capacity tounsm during Christmas
Best Practice	Providing support for the diverse needs of individuals and families Disney has been a pioneer in this effort They understood early on that adults are along for the ride with their kids they too need some fun, rest and relaxation in Orlando This type of offering has expanded to include many attractions which are targeted specifically at adults, most notably the Disney Institute, where guests can learn a new hobby (cooking, climbing, guitar-playing) with the help ot distinguished experts in the field
Best Practice	Ensuring consistency between the actual tourist demographics and the needs and wants that the destination serves Las Vegas has scarcely missed a step in its highly successful endeavor to expand their market beyond gamblers and to develop attractions for broader markets
Best Practice	Finding and developing undiscovered value inherent in the destination During its 120-year history, Branson has ingeniously cultivated its brand through major transformations At first, people visited for the great fishing and the mysterious cave Later, they came for a unique theme-parx experience based on the region's history and culture Then came live country music shows, a broad



offering of theme entertainment, and finally, the best entertainment
available in a single place in America’s Midwest

Best Practice Establish a public-private interest coordinator that is financed
by both the private and public sectors The benchmark
destinations most frequently utilized a special tourism tax. such as a
bed-tax on hotels Other possible tax measures are an airport tax. a
restaurant tax, and taxation on events and attractions 11

The Central Value Proposition

Vision and brands are a fundamental part of commercial activity, but does a city need
a vision and a brand for tourism development'? The answer is yes, because
destinations, like companies, must communicate to a broad market of consumers
what they are, why they offer what they do, and the consistency and quality of their
offerings

This is accomplished through the brand and through the vision Ultimately, a
company's vision is the most visible part of that company's marketing strategy, and
the same is true for cities When any city is without a strong vision, its marketing
strength is severely undermined Destination brand essence is a term used
frequently m destination marketing to indicate the synergy of vision and branding in
strategic marketing

Benchmarks of Brand Essence

Not surprisingly, the benchmark destinations had each cultivated a powerful brand
essence

•	The most important vacation you’ll ever take - Colonial Williamsburg

•	Live Music and Wholesome Fun - Branson

•	The World’s Favorite Place for Family Fun - Orlando

•	The Unique Riverboat Experience - Biloxi

•	The Ultimate Entertainment and Gaming Extravaganza - Las Vegas

Destination Multibranding

Having an effective brand essence does not require, however, that the destination
must be one-dimensional in its appeal In all of the benchmark destinations, beneath
the brand essence are a family of diverse offerings, each of which has a brand of its
own

This form of marketing -- multibranding - is motivated by the findings of market
research in 4 of the 5 destinations (Las Vegas, Orlando, Williamsburg, Branson)
This research indicates that most visitors are seeking a varied experience that





’2

includes several distinctive attractions8 In most cases, a premier attraction functions
as a hook to bring m tounsts, who will ultimately spend money on many other items

•	Las Vegas Gambling casinos

•	Orlando Disneyworld

•	Colonial Williamsburg Historical re-enactments

•	Branson Household-name performers

A visitor to any of these destinations will inevitably experience far more than the hook
attraction Multiple values are each branded and communicated to the potential
consumer as a total, diverse experience

<

8 This is true even when a visitor intends to spend only a few days at the destination

The Power of Market Knowledge

It is nothing new to take tourists for granted, to assume they will respond to the
opportunity to visit a nice city Operating in this way — m the dark, so to speak -- is
not necessarily wrong (it is an essentially organic growth strategy), but it certainly can
impede the city's ability to achieve its most far-reaching and important goals A city
cannot plan, cannot fully benefit from its potentials, or reliably avoid the inherent
negative possibilities, without knowledge of the tourism market, visitors (demand
side) and tourism industries (supply side)

The benchmark destinations illustrate, in fact, that with increased market knowledge,
the improvements in strategic marketing are powerful All of the destination marketing
organizations we benchmarked invest a significant portion (2% to 10%) of their
annual budget on research, and they are continually innovating ways to gather
market information and apply it Surveys and focus groups with potential consumers,
post-purchase satisfaction surveys, as well as demographic and market trend data
are fundamental inputs to their marketing strategy development (See Disneyworld
Case, below)

Marketing is. by one definition, the science of creating added customer value, and it
follows that good marketing requires knowledge of what customer value is The most
basic marketing question is "What do our customers, or potential customers, value7"
A well researched and considered answer to this question provides the foundation for
the rest of the marketing program segmentation and targeting, new product
development, product management, brand management, channel management,
marketing communications, and even the structures of the planning organizations
Thus research, whether conducted on a qualitative or quantitative basis, is ignored at
the marketer's peril'

Tourism is a relatively new field for marketing that was the primary motivation for
benchmarking destinations that are on the leading edge of marketing, and not those
destinations that are most similar in character Academic work m the field of
destination marketing is still in its infancy, although Marketing Places, by Kotler,
Haider, and Rem, is a worthwhile introduction to the larger field of place marketing,
including tourism as one dimension Certainly, marketing experts are beginning to
undertake academic research and analysis in this area, but in the meantime it is
primarily up to cities themselves to innovate destination marketing and advance the
field But just like academics, destination marketing organizations must first conduct
sufficient research to realize value from the work

Case: Disneyworld’s Customer Intimacy

Soon after having booked a trip to a Disneyworld resort, a visitor receives a
personalized letter with extensive information on the total Disney offering in Orlando
Upon arnval and check-m, the visitor is provided with a Disneyworld credit card, which
can be used to pay for literally anything that is available in Disneyworld meals, shows,
gift-shopping, park attractions, and other vacation services This credit card also, of
course, enables Disney to know the visitor's complete purchasing behavior, down to
the penny and the moment it was paid for It is powerful information for marketing
purposes On a one-to-one marketing basis. Disney is able to -- and in fact does, in
subsequent direct mailings -- tailor its offering to returning visitors, and in its total
offenng, Disney has the ability to micromanage each component to create optimal
value for each visitor within the spectrum of targeted visitor groups

Targets: the Basis for Coordination

The first application of destination marketing data is most often the setting of targets
for visitation in future years Quantitative targets, like the qualitative goals set forward
in the vision and brand essence, are integral parts of marketing strategy and
planning In destination marketing, more so than almost any other industry, there is
an enormous number of directly involved parties who together develop the
destination hotels, museums, event planners, theaters, restaurants, municipal
departments, international and intracity transportation providers, and many more

One of the most astounding observations in the benchmark destinations was the high
level to which all of these parties were aware of the total tourism growth target and
had coordinated their own targets and planning to the overall target Quantitative
targets are simple to communicate, and relevant parties can, with some
straightforward assistance, understand how it would be mutually profitable to
contribute through participation in the overall program Targets are the keys to
success in destination marketing

total population of an area) and monitor the response of specific markets to marketing
programs	!

On targeting specific consumer, groups (e.g. Motor-Coach,. FITs, etc.) and;
monitoring marketing performance with respect to each:

In addition to geographic source, we also track by business type so we know if.
motorcoach, corporate group outing, season passholder.'etc , are doing.well This is
done by tracking business by ticket sale and developing tracking numbers, allowing us •
to assign the tickets to categories	,

On research on how consumers respond to specific components of the offering:

To do this, we generally conduct focus groups to get reaction.to current and.potential
future attractions within the park We also distribute questionnaires to people leaving
the park at the end of the day and ask them to rate various attractions and aspects of
the park

On measuring tourist visitors’ purchases in the city, and the resulting
contribution to local business development and public tax revenues:

Within.the park, it’s easy to monitor spending by type To get an idea of overall’
economic impact, the Revolutionary Fun cooperative group surveys people who called
in.from out vacation package offenngs and determine from purchasers and non-
purchasers who-went to Virgima what their spending was while in-state This.allows us
to go to the state legislature and request tax funding of tourism efforts because we can
demonstrate a definite return on investment	.	,

) **. ' 1

On creating targets for the number of tourist visitors coming to specific events
(e g., concerts, festivals, sporting events, etc.)'	'

At one time we hosted concerts mour park, but eliminated them to realize cost
savings We.are now adding-speciahevents, such as a night Halloween operation m
October The targets are pretty simple We know what a person:wiH;spend:to get into
our park and how much they will spend on food and merchandise once.inside, so we
need to attract enough visitors to pay for the Halloween*expenses and make a profit

Conclusions on the use of statistics and targets for a sound marketing strategy:

If you don’t have revenue-dnventrackmg and targets, you will never know
what is working and what isn’t This would result in the waste of much.ofi -
your marketing resources

Segmenting the Tourism Marketing and Selecting Targets

The second key application of consumer knowledge should be segmentation and
selection of target segments The broad market of former, current and potential
customers can be segmented along an almost infinite number of dimensions -- all the
way down to segments of one consumer, treated as a unique individual9 The
benchmark destinations use many different segmentation variables, the most
frequent being geography, age, family status, household income, needs and wants,
length of stay, trip budget

9 The segmentation approach should not only be customized to the demand-side of the market under
study (e g . European tounsts), but also to the offenng that is being marketed (e g . London) Loncon
would always be better off if it uses a market segmentation that is customized, and not simply the
carbon copy of Paris’s market segmentation, for instance This already appears to have been
accomplished, for the most part

The practice of selecting target groups as the basis for their marketing strategies
enables these destinations to get greater and more consistent returns from their
investments in product development, marketing communications, development of
placement channels, etc And in today’s marketing environment, which is increasingly
oriented to electronic communication media and information technology, targeting is
especially useful, because only then can one utilize the new tools email, Internet, e-
commerce, database marketing, and total customization

Harmonizing Leadership Roles Between Public and Private Sectors

In most major destinations, tourism services suppliers from the private sector provide
the lion’s share of the investments and new offerings, marketing communications,
and channel management But the long-term success of destination marketing relies
on coordination of the private-sector with the public sector and the citizens of the
destination In benchmark destination marketing, the public-private interest
coordinator brings together the distinct interests of all groups into a powerful
symbiotic system

The benchmark destinations illustrate a special form of virtuous circle for
development

=> A leadership role by the public sector nurtures private sector growth

=> Private sector growth increases the tax revenue base

=> An increased tax revenue base enables the public sector to invest more in
large-scale research, branding, promotions, and other activities, which only
the public sector has a direct interest in performing

=> Greater public leadership facilitates increases in private sector growth on a
sustainable basis

The vital connection for this type of virtuous circle to work is taxation, preferably
targeted directly at tourism industry revenues Among the benchmark destinations,
taxation based on bed-nights is the most frequently used

Benchmark Models of Cooperation

Private investment is the engine of growth for most American destination tourism But
in each case some form of public-sector coordination accompanied this investment
The benchmarks included three models of investment and development

1	Private entrepreneurial development with public sector leadership Branson

2	Corporate development with public sector partnership Biloxi, Las Vegas and
Williamsburg

3	Mega-corporate development’0 with public sector facilitation Orlando
(Disney, Universal Studios)

0 It is interesting to note that m Orianao, the most important area of cooperation is between the mega-
corporations. who have found it necessary to agree on at least one thing "let's get the tourists to
Orlando, and then we can compete with each other"



Key facts on Benchmark Destination Models of Public-Private Cooperation

•	Private capital investment in Las Vegas - construction of casinos and resorts --
totaled $1 775 billion in 1998 and is projected at $3 794 billion for 1999

•	Colonial Williamsburg raised $25 7 million in 1998 from a membership base of sixty-

five thousand private donors in the United States	•	<

•	Branson charges a 4% tax on hotel nights and entertainment One-quarter of this tax
revenue'is dedicated toinbound tourism marketing The contribution was $6 million in
1998

•	Las Vegas charges a 9% room-tax Three-quarters of these funds are directed to Las
Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority The total contnbution was $105 million in
1998, of which $72 million was spent on destination marketing, $20 million on special
events (30 events in the off-season), and $6 million on convention promotion {Las
Vegas hosts 60 conventions a year)

•	Orlando Convention and Visitors Bureau had a $22 million budget in 1998, 10-15%
contributed by tax on resorts The remainder of its budget comes from 1500
businesses that are members, each, ofwhonr pays a fee based on its tounsm
revenues

( i

Benefits for the Citizens of the Destination

Taxation and investment is not only a 2-way street between the public and private
sectors The ultimate concerned party in tourism development is the citizens of the
destination city Tax revenues from tourism provide a direct benefit to their welfare,
whereby special tourist-tax revenues go to schools and infrastructure for the
community

Job creation in tourist industries also constitutes a significant contnbution As a
service industry, tourism is heavily labor dependent, and creates a relatively large
number of jobs compared to other types of industry The citizens of the destination
are thereby included in the virtuous circle

=* Cooperative leadership by the public and private sectors leads to sustained
growth in the quality of life for the destination citizens

There are, of course, other benefits that tourism provides to citizens, but which
cannot be measured in such precise terms For example, tourism to the city inspires
civic pnde, new understandings and appreciations of the city, globalism and
international friendship While difficult to measure, these benefits can and should be
cultivated and communicated in a destination marketing program

Key facts on Benchmark Destination Benefits for Citizens

•	Nevada's casinos employ 170,000 people with total compensation of $4 28 billion

•	. The Las Vegas-9% hotel room tax contributed $16 4 million to local.schools and $18

million to public infrastructure in 1998

•	In Branson, three-quarters of the revenue from the 4% tourism tax are spent on local

infrastructure The county also directly provides $34 million in tax revenues to the
state .	*	...••	'	•.	‘	•

•	Orlando tourism revenues generate a $356 9 million yearly revenue for the
government The government's expenses on behalf of tourism are $256 1 million /
year This results in a $100 8 million annual surplus generated by tourism for the

. Orange County and City of Orlando governments In: addition, a substantial amount of
; ad valorem tax revenues{$318 2 million / year) are generated for area schools
Subtracting the governmient expenditures for tourism employees’ children ($298 1

/Exp'erienee r.yarie ty, Fun, and ,Quali ty

The Necessity of Pure Enjoyability

How to define tourism? We recognize that tourism begins when people travel away
from home for reasons other than business or personal The tourist is looking for a
particular kind of experience, which may include personal enrichment through new
knowledge and experiences, or simply relaxation in an environment devoted to
his/her enjoyment and convenience We can also say that, in its nature of being not
necessary, tourism is voluntary, leisureful, fanciful

In a sense, many of the most popular destinations on earth are being weakened by
their status as “Must see" locations That is never really true, of course, because of
the very nature of tourism And m thinking of themselves as necessary trips, the
marketers of these destinations sometimes start to forget why the tourists "must
come" in the first place that the destination is, purely and simply, great fun

The benchmark destinations are focused, with the intensity of lasers, on providing fun
for their visitors It is not generic fun. of course -- each of the benchmark destinations
offers a unique experience and varied forms of fun Each destination's offering fills
the whole day with opportunities for different kinds of fun to choose from The offering
mix is broad, providing activities for many moods and tastes sports, museums,
entertainment attractions, nightclubs, shops, etc

Best practices in innovating fun and variety

•	Anticipate unspoken needs and wants by

(1)	Making shopping an entertainment activity*1 e g, Caesars Forum and
Mills Corp Malls in Las Vegas

(2)	Recognizing how and where visitors need to relax e g , Disney's Resort
Spas

(3)	Lightening the traveler's burden of responsibilities e g , children's and
adults' only programs at Colonial Williamsburg

•	Enable tourists to pre-plan their agendas by providing sufficient information well
before their trip starts Orlando supplies visitors a mailing that can be brought along
on the trip very easily

15 Shopping In the benchmark destinations, especially Las Vegas and Orlando, shopping has been
developed as an activity that is well suited to filling the free time that families and spouses nave during a
vacation The potential for combining shopping with entertainment was first recognizee by Mirage CEO
Steve Winn a single gift shop in the Mirage Resort earnec 522 million in its first year The secret was
drawing visitors there and keeping them there with a variety of entertainments Today, the Forum Shops
at Caesar's Palace earn more money per square *oot of retail space than any other mall in the world
(Si000/ft2) The Forum Shops were developed by Steve Da Bartolo of Mall of America fame

Retailing has become a very important part of the experience for tourists in many places around the
world Coiomal Williamsburg earns $2 5 million collars m sales 'cvenue from retail Orlande s CityWaik
and Downtown Disney are cynamic complexes that integrate entertainment and shopping

22

• To entice repeat visits, the destination’s total product offering must exceed
expectations

Assured Quality of the Experience

It would seem that anyone who has been on a vacation is pleasantly familiar with that
wonderful experience of arriving to find all the promised qualities at her destination,
and sometimes the experience of something greater-than-expected Unfortunately,
most of us are also personally knowledgeable of the seanng disappointment of
traveling at great cost and inconvenience to a place that is far less enjoyable than
expected The prospective tourist naturally operates under a certain veil of ignorance
about the place where he will travel to does a nice new experience await me, or one
of a very different kind9

The origins of destination marketing are, of course, those basic communication
activities which try to interest and assure the prospective tourist about the quality and
enjoyability of the destination But it is well understood today that destination
marketing must first ensure that the quality and enjoyability in fact exist at the
destination' Without quality and enjoyability, a tourism destination will never thrive,
and can indeed become a great sore for all concerned parties

Here again, the combined leadership of the public and private sectors plays the most
vital role hotels, restaurants, shops, museums, special event programs, airlines,
public transportation systems, information bureaus, police departments, et cetera, all
make integral contributions to the quality of the destination And if any one player
contributes at a particularly low level of quality, conceivably the entire whole can be
ruined in the tourist’s eyes Assurances of quality must be the responsibility of all
parties

The ramifications of serious quality lapses in fact go much deeper If a destination, in
an ill-considered effort to attract large numbers of tourists, begins to undermine its
quality12, the citizens themselves can be severely affected Citizens do not always
welcome tourism industry expansion because they are aware of the potential traffic
bottlenecks, pollution, corruptions of the cultural and historical character of their
home city, and other negative impacts on the quality of their lives If citizens are not
given assurance against these negative side effects, or the compensation of a certain
increase in some quality of city life, a backlash can ensue and the destination
marketing efforts go back to square one

Because quality is so vital, the single best practice in destination marketing today is
to confer the overall responsibility for quality assurance to the public-private interest

12	Often when a destination's quality is in decline, it is due to the reverse of the virtuous circle
the vicious cycle Tourism service suppliers will often attempt to reduce the quality of their
offerings in order to increase revenue and net profit, and this inevitably affects the overall
quality of the destination Consequently, the destination will be visited by fewer tounsts who
seek high-quality destinations Thus, there will be less demand for high-quality tourism
services, and the overall quality of the destination is further reduced This vicious cycle will
continue to operate until a coordinated effort is made to reverse the quality decline



[

coordinator This body has the duty to inspire and. if necessary, enforce through
regulations, an acceptable level of quality in all aspects of destination marketing

The I ourism / Gaming Phenomenon

The powerful marketing potential of legalized gaming m destination marketing can be
explained in part by noting that large-scale gambling is one type of fun that is in
scarce supply in the world Most countries have not legalized gambling, and so
enthusiasts and curious people travel from around the world to Las Vegas, Atlantic
City, Sun City, and Monaco, to gamble, and to enjoy the lavish spectacle that has
become an integral aspect of gambling On a smaller scale, Native Amencan
Reservations in the United States and Canada have exploited the power of gambling
to bring in visitors from surrounding areas

For these destinations, gaming has had many positive effects increased
employment, a massive increase in tax revenues, and an external effect whereby
visitors spend money on other types of businesses at the destination (e g , hotels,
restaurants, etc ) These positive outcomes can be the basis for the future growth and
diversification of the destination There are also severely negative impacts that can
arise in the community because of gambling, of course - less so with legalized
gambling than with an illegal gambling industry’3 - but that is outside the scope of
this report

In benchmark meetings in Las Vegas and Biloxi, several points of interest for a
destination marketing program were discussed

•	Gambling requires multiple licenses to attract outside tourism

•	Gambling creates a social problem for less than 2% of the local population13 14
However, the "sin" stigma may actually limit convention business, if the destination is
primarily associated with gambling activities

•	Gaming industry investors are earning as much through hotels, dining, and shopping
as they do on gaming

•	Gambling is a tourist attraction that is not sensitive to weather conditions

•	Gaming provides for cost savings on hotel and food prices visitors to Las Vegas are
able to expenence luxury for much less than anywhere else in the US Gambling
contributes one-half of a hotel's total revenue

13	One of the most positive impacts of gambling legalization is that it takes away a common
platform for organized crime activity This has been the case, most dramatically, in Las Vegas
and Atlantic City, where organized crime has been unable to thnve in the new open market for
gambling

Email Message to Supervisor Bob Waterston
Copies to all other Supervisors

Supervisor Waterston,

At the Board of Supervisors hearing on July 13, during the hearing on the Transient Occupancy
Tax, you asked if the comparison being made by the RJI of Kern County and Fresno County was
an apples to apples comparison You specifically asked about the number of hotel beds in the
unincorporated area of the two counties We promised to provide a response to your questions It
follows

Kern County Fresno County

County Population	703,000	841,000

# of Hotel Beds in unincorporated area	909	921

Traveler Expenditures ($M)	$931	$818

Travel Related Employment	15,280	13,880

Travel Related Employment % of Total Employment 4 2%	2	7%

Local Sales Tax on Traveler Expenditures ($M)*	$ 14 5 $ 16 2

A few. noteworthy observations:

1	Although Fresno County is larger than Kern County and has the advantage of being the
gateway to three world-class national parks, being the most prominent agricultural center
in the world (pnme area for the fast-growing agri-tounsm sector), and having more lakes
than any other county in California, Kern County last year employed 1400 more people

. in the tourism sector and derived $113 million more in traveler expenditures than Fresno
County

2	If Fresno’s travel related employment, currently at 2 7% of total employment, could be
increased to the Kern County level of 4 2%, Fresno County would add 6,933 jobs and an
estimated $8 million in added sales tax revenues on traveler expenditures

3	Kern County has an annual tourism budget of approximately $1 million, employing a
staff of seven people and spending approximately $0 5 million per year in tourism
promotion This budget comes from a TOT tax, currently at 6%, which the County is
considering raising to 12%

* Bakersfield *s sales tax (7.25%) ts less than Fresno's sales tax rate (7.875%)which is the
reason why local sales tax raised in Kern County is less than Fresno County despite Kern
County’s additional $113 million in traveler expenditures If traveler expenditures in Fresno
County increased by $113 million, it would generate additional sales tax m Fresno County of
more than $8,000,000

BOARD OF TRADE

ENHANCING KERN COUNTY’S ECONOMY

PURPOSE OF INQUIRY

Pursuant to Penal Code sections 925 and 933 the Administration & Audit committee
selected the Kern County Board of Trade as one of the county departments for oversight
review this year. This inquiry was conducted through interviews with the director of the
Board of Trade, the County Administrative Office, and information provided by the
County Elections Division

BACKGROUND

The Kern County Board of Trade is the County’s public relations agency, responsible for
promoting and marketing Kern County Founded m 1888 with the mission to “EXTOL
THE VIRTUES OF KERN COUNTY TO THE EAST’ The Board of Trade Department
with a staff of seven and a budget of $481,000 administers:

•	Kcm County’s official tounsm bureau, providing visitor information and promoting
Kcm County as a travel-tourism destination

•	The Kcm County Film Commission, providing permits and services for film,
television and commercial productions, as well as marketing Kcm County as a
location for filming

•	The County’s efforts to promote Kem County as a retirement destination

•	The County’s special events, including the annual Kcm Film Festival and the Kem
Products Dinner

FINDINGS

•	Publications of the Board of Trade include

“Kcm County Business”, a monthly newsletter

“Discover Kem County”, Kem County Visitor & Tourism Guide

Various specialty brochures Golf, Camping, Museums, etc

•	Travel spending by tourists and business visitors amounts to approximately $940
million annually in Kem County This spending generates $240 million in earnings
(profit) to various Kcm County businesses, $22.5 million in local tax revenue, and

15,000	local jobs. Travel spending is tracked using an annual report prepared for the
California Division of Tourism by Dean Runyan & Associates This report describes
the direct economic impacts of travel to and through the state of California and each
of its counties

•	Film production companies spent SI3 6 million m the county during 2002-03 while
shooting on location resulting in 221 Filming permits issued and 545 production days
The Board of Trade and Film Commission produce an excellent guide to on-location
filming in Kern County, “Kem County Film Production Directory”

•	The Board of Trade administers the Tourism Promotion Grant of $100,000, which is
distributed to various non-profit organizations including local chambers of
commerce to promote tounsm

•	The Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT), commonly called hotel room or bed tax, is the
tax which visitors or tourists pay when they stay in Kem County, as Kcm County
residents pay to other city or county governments when they stay out of the county
This tax rate ranges from 6% to 12% for incorporated cities in Kem County
Bakersfield City has the highest rate of 12% Usually some of this tax is used by
local governments to promote tounsm and attract businesses Until April 2002 Kem
County TOT rate in the unincorporated areas was 10% for a period of about ten years
(1992-2002). The State Supreme Court ruled in 2001 that Kem County must roll
back tins tax to its 1991 rate of 6%, since the increase to 10% was not approved by
the voters. Measure “D” was placed on the March 2002 ballot, as requested and
supported by KERNTAX, to approve the rate of 10%; but it failed due to lack of
promotion and possible misunderstanding of the public This roll back of the TOT
from 10% to 6% results in about a $700,000 loss in tax revenue to county
government each year For 2002 Kem County collected $1 million at the 6% rate.
The City of Bakersfield collected about $6 million in tax at the 12% rate

•	The Board of Trade has experienced, during the last two years, about a 50% reduction
in its tounsm marketing budget which will have a negative affect on tourism tax
revenue generation

•	The Board of Trade is not able to assess dues or fees to businesses or Chambers of
Commerce that benefit from its tounsm promotion services

•	A website (www rctireinkem com) is being developed to entice retirees to Kem
County

•	Signage directing traffic from Hwy 99 to the Board of Trade Visitor Center on Oak
Street is not adequate, or easy to follow.

•	The Board of Trade has interest in developing a Visitor Center at the base of the
Grapevine with assistance from both Southern and Northern counties, cities and
businesses that might benefit from tounsts that would stop there for information
This center would require a 365 days a year operation schedule, if the state approves
it as an official visitor center

COMMENTS

The Board of Trade presents itself as a very professional and efficient operation in which
the residents of Kcm County should have great pride in having it represent the county in
the tourism and business arena However, with reductions in marketing funds available
to the Board of Trade it is difficult for the board to reach potential tourists and enhance
the travel spending in Kcm County and related tourism tax revenue. Now is not the time
to be “Penny wise and pound foolish” with dollars that produce tourism earnings and
taxes. Therefore, the following recommendations are offered:

RECOMMENDATIONS

1.	Consider resubmitting to the voters a ballot measure with a convincing argument to
increase the Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) in the unincorporated areas of the
county from 6% to a rate of 12%, which conforms with the City of Bakersfield TOT
rate. The additional revenue ($1 million) generated by this tax increase should then
go to marketing and promoting tourism in the county

2.	Research the possibility of placing a surcharge on hotel room rates to be used for
marketing tourism

3	Research the possibility of assessing fees or dues to businesses and Chambers of
Commerce that benefit from Board of Trade activities

4.	Develop adequate signage, starting at the city edges, directing tourists from Hwy 99
to the Visitor Center on Oak Street

5	Continue to develop programs that attract retirees to the county

6. Pursue the development of a state approved Visitor Center at the base of the
Grapevine with support from businesses and other California counties and cities, both
North and South of us, that might benefit. Determine if private funds might be
obtained to construct the facility.

The Kern County Board of Trade is the County's public relations agency, responsible for
promoting and marketing Kern County. Founded in 1888 with the mission to "extol the
virtues of Kern County to the East," the Board of Trade specifically administers

•	Kem Count/s official tounsm bureau, providing visitor information and promoting
Kern County as a travel-tourism destination

•	The Kem County Film Commission, providing permits and services for film, television
and commercial production, as well as marketing Kern County as a location for
filming

•	Information on Kem County as one of California's premiere retirement destinations
with information on housing, activities, services and quality of life

Each of these areas has a significant economic influence in Kem County Travel spending
totaled $905 million in Kem County in 2000, while production companies spend an average
of $10 to 15 million a year in the county while shooting on location

In addition, the Board of Trade conducts a number of special events to raise the profile and
influence of Kem County, including the annual Kem Film Festival, which celebrates the
history of filmmaking in Kern County, the annual Kem Products Dinner, which rotates
between Sacramento and Bakersfield, and the State of the County Breakfast

Kem River Valley organizations receive grants to promote tourism

First District Supervisor Jon McQuiston joined fellow board members today in approving
$41.700 in tounsm promotion grants Two Kem River Valley organizations received a
portion of the funds Kem River Valley Revitalization. Inc and Kern River Valley
Chamber of Commerce Another $5,000 award was also given to the East Kem
organization Friends of Jawbone

KRV Revitalization. Inc will use its $8,000 in funding for the KRV Tounsm Media
Outreach 2004 program The goal of the program is to promote awareness of the Kem
River Valley and Giant Sequoia National Monument and enhance the area's image as a
desirable travel destination

The KRV Chamber of Commerce was awarded $5 200 to cover trade show related
costs The trade shows are one of many venues used by the Chamber of Commerce to
encourage tounsm to the Kem River Valley

In addition to the two Kem River Valley grants, an additional $5,000 was awarded to
Fnends of Jawbone to pnnt maps of off-highway vehicle ndmg areas and trails within
portions of desert areas of eastern Kem County

Requests for funds were reviewed and evaluated by the Tounsm Promotion Grant
Committee, consisting of representatives from the Board of Trade and County
Administrative Office Those awarded grants were judged on how their efforts would
increase the number of tounsts or increase the length of their stay in Kem County
“It is difficult to overstate the importance of tounsm to the Kem River Valley/’ said First
Distnct Supervisor Jon McQuiston “These grants will help get the word out nationally
and internationally about all of the wonderful tounsm opportunities in Kem County ”

Bob,

At the Board of Supervisors meeting on July 13, during the hearing on the Transient
Occupancy Tax, you asked if the comparison being made by the RJI of Kern County and
Fresno County was an "apples to apples" comparison You specifically asked about the
number of hotel beds in the unincorporated area of the two counties We promised to provide
a response to your questions It follows

Kern County Fresno County

County Population	703,000	841,000
U of Hotel Beds in unincorporated area	909	921
Traveler Expenditures ($M)	$931	$818
Travel Related Employment	15,280	13,880
Travel Related Employment % of Total Employment	4 2%	2 7%
Local Sales Tax on Traveler Expenditures ($M)*	$14 5	$162

A few noteworthy observations:

1	Although Fresno County is larger than Kern County and has the advantage of being
the gateway to three world-class national parks, being the most prominent agricultural
center in the world (prime area for the fast-growing agn-tounsm sector), and having
more lakes than any other county in California, Kern County last year employed 1400
more people in the tounsm sector and derived $113 million more in traveler
expenditures than Fresno County

2	If Fresno’s travel related employment, currently at 2 7% of total employment, could
be increased to the Kern County level of 4 2%, Fresno County would add 6,933 jobs
and an estimated $8 million in added sales tax revenues on traveler expenditures

3	Kern County has an annual tounsm budget of approximately $1 million, employing a
staff of seven people and spending approximately $0 5 million per year in tounsm
promotion This budget comes from a TOT tax, currently at 6%, which the County is
considering raising to 12%

* Bakersfield ’s sales tax (7 25%) is less than Fresno \s sales tax rate (7.875%) which is the
reason why local sales tax raised in Kern County is less than Fresno County despite Kern
County's additional $113 million m traveler expenditures. If traveler expenditures in
Fresno County increased by $113 million, it would generate additional sales tax in
Fresno County of more than $8,000,000

NOTE: The above data is as reported by the State of California on its tourism Website at

Subject:	Regional Jobs Initiative Tourism Ouster

The proposal to fund a tourism initiative through a Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT),
also referred to as a Travelers Lodging Tax (TLC), was heard by the Board of
Supervisors at its July 13, 2004, meeting Support for the TLC was heard from
representatives of the County Tounsm Committe and from the Regional Jobs
Imtiative Two people spoke in opposition Mr John Sherry of Lakeshore Lodge and
Mr John Hams of Hams Ranch A motion put forward by Supervisor Arambula,
requested, in part, that the parties meet and seek to find a compromise The motion
passed on a 4-0 vote, Supervisor Case having recused herself from the matter

On Friday, July 16th, a meeting was held to address the concerns of Harris Ranch,
represented at the meeting by Mr Kirk Doyle, Hospitality Manager The meeting was
hosted by Ms Carolina Jimenez Hogg of Fresno County's Economic Development
Department Supervisor Arambula participated in the first part of the meeting Two
representatives of the RJ1 attended the meeting Ms Cynthia Downing and Mr Peter
Weber Also in attendance were representatives from the County Counsel's office as
well as representatives from the Chamber of Commerce and the Fresno Business
Council

The meeting was very cordial A number of alternative compromises were discussed,
the parties concluding that the two most viable options would be summarized in an
email message from representatives of the RJI to Hams Ranch That email, which we
trust is self-explanatory, is copied below Also copied below is the email response
from Harris Ranch

The fact that Hams Ranch has rejected the options discussed at the July 16 meeting
and submitted no equitable, legally viable alternative compromise, should not mark
the death knell of the proposed TLC We have the utmost respect for Mr Hams and
the Hams Ranch enterprise We would be irresponsible, however, if we did not
continue to press for the funding needed to create the thousands of jobs that we
believe are available to the County of Fresno through a properly funded tourism
entity The fact that growth in Fresno County's traveler revenues rank 50th out of 58
counties in California speaks volumes about how badly we have neglected our
tounsm sector The fact that Fresno County is one of just 2 of California’s 58 counties
that does not charge a Transient Occupancy Tax is evidence of the fact that we are not
making use of the financial resouces that other counties use to promote their
economic development

Funding of our community's many areas of need, including public safety, must come
principally from an expanded tax base As noted in the July 19 email message sent to
the County Board of Supervisors, a comparison of Kern County and Fresno County
suggests that raising Fresno's tourism activity to the level of Kem County (which
funds its estimated $1 million annual tourism budget through TOT taxes) could

potentially generate almost 7,000 jobs and $8 million in added sales tax revenue from
travelers Our County is too economically depressed, our double-digit unemployment
has been with us for too long, for us to be able to look the other way on this
opportunity to increase our employment and our tax base A number of community
organizations, representing hundreds of employers in Fresno County, are expected to
support this point of view at the July 27 Board of Supervisors meeting

The RJ1 remains amenable to either of the two compromises discussed at the July 16
meeting, or variations thereof that the Board of Supervisors may wish to consider We
have asked the County staff to draft the TLC ordinance incorporating the first of the
two alternatives discussed at the July 16 meeting, because we feel it is the fairest way
to assure some direct benefit, m addition to the many indirect benefits, to all the
lodging facilities whose guests would be paying the lodging charge (the issuance of
marketing and promotion grants to participating lodging facilities is an approcah used
by other tourism entities, including Ken County) However, the RJI is not committed
to a specific approach and would be receptive to any alternative approaches the Board
of Supervisors wish to propose, whether or not they involve a TLC, provided that the
tounsm entity is funded at a credible level by January of2005 A commitment to job
creation in Fresno County requires nothing less

Subject RE Travelers Lodging Charge on November, 2004, ballot
Cynthia,

We appreciate the opportunity to work with you on this effort, but feci that due to several factors this is
not a viable program that wc can support and we would oppose the measure going to the voters m
November

We feel that the vast majority of the facilities generating this new tax are opposed to it as they both feel
they are being taxed disproportionately to other beneficiaries and they also question the overall
payback and value of an expanded governmental effort to promote tounsm

It appears that some of the options wc suggested are not possible to do, and thus wc just don’t think it is
feasible to go to the voters with this measure We feel there are already 2 important tax measures on
the ballot These at least tax everyone equally and although these will cost our company considerable
new monies, we feel we can support them as they are fair and equitable

Subject Travelers Lodging Charge on November, 2004, ballot
Importance High
Kirk -

Thank you for taking the time to drive into Fresno on Friday to meet with us and explore ways to
collaborate on the Travelers Lodging Charge Our conversation helped us better understand the
concerns of Hams Ranch and I trust they helped you understand why this tourism authority is so
important to our community We greatly appreciated your willingness to explore the alternatives

To recap Friday's meeting. County Counsel made it clear that a general Travelers Lodging Charge
(TLC) - which would require just 50% of the voters (plus one) to pass - cannot legally be dedicated to
any specific purposes (such as tounsm or public safety) Wc agreed this was not an option so the TLC
would have to be a special tax (which requires a 2/3 vote to pass) County Counsel also confirmed it
would not be legal to direct TLC revenues to a particular geography or to allow lodging facilities to
direct the TLC revenues raised from their guests to either tounsm or public safety

With that understood, we discussed two possibilities that would benefit Hams Ranch and Hams Farms
while simultaneously achieving the objectives of the Regional Jobs Initiative These possibilities arc

1	A special tax dedicated to tounsm with annual grants awarded to Hams Ranch and other lodging
facilities, proportionate to the TLC amounts paid by each location To provide Hams Ranch and other
lodging facilities some level of assurance that these proposed grants would be paid, the tounsm entity
that is to be created would establish in its by-laws that a minimum of 25% of the TLC collected would
be dedicated to the issuance of these grants Additional grants could be made at the discretion of the
board of the tounsm entity The grants could be used for marketing and advertising and they would
enable Hams Ranch to reduce its current budget for maikcting and advertising resulting in a direct
positive impact to your bottom line I'm forwarding an article that desenbes the grant program Kcm
Count)' offers to illustrate how such a program could work m Fresno County

2	A special tax dedicated to tounsm AND public safety Such an initiative could be called the Safe
Tounst Promotion Measure on the November ballot which might have added appeal to the voters As
wc discussed, TLC funds directed towards public safety cannot be earmarked for a specific area of the
County (such as the 1-5 comdor) However, we could all encourage the Shcnff to deploy deputies in
the 1-5 comdor in the hopes of dramatically reducing response times tn the comdor Under this option,
wc are proposing that 25% of the TLC proceeds be directed to public safety because wc believe Hams
Ranch will denve benefits from tounsm promotion. As wc discussed at the meeting, wc are confident
the planned participation of the tounsm entity m domestic and international POWOWs and travel
shows will generate benefits to Hams Ranch Wc are also confident that Hams Ranch will benefit
from the tounsm traffic that the tounsm entity will bring into the Valley as wc move up from 50th m
tounsm revenues (out of 58 counties in California) to a more respectable place among the top 10
counties Additionally, Hams Ranch would remain eligible for discretionary grants as desenbed in
alternative one above Since the TLC has a sunset clause of 7 years, its success in generating additional
tounsm business and/or improving public safety can be evaluated to see what levels of benefits have,
m fact, been delivered

We also discussed composition of the board of directors of the new tounsm entity Wc welcome any
guidance you can provide to help us make this new entity successful When we met on June 18,1
expressed our hope that a representative from Hams Ranch would participate on the board of the
tounsm entity Wc remain committed to including Hams Ranch in our tounsm efforts to every extent
possible Wc appreciate that proceeding with cither of the two options we discussed will require an act
of faith on the part of Mr Hams, since neither option offers Hams Ranch the iron-clad assurances you
would like to have that your public safety concerns are gomg to be addressed We are confident,

however, that between us we will have the ability to see that the intent of the agreement we reach is m
fact implemented

Kiric, you agreed to discuss these options with John Hams and let us know your thoughts before
Wednesday, July 21, the County's deadline for publishing the text of the revised ordinance 1 know this
effort is moving quickly, which can be unsettling, but if we w'ait we will not have another opportunity
until November, 2006, and that ballot will likely have even more tax measures than this November’s
ballot

We all want what’s best for Fresno County By working together, we will improve the economy, lower
unemployment, and create more taxpayers We believe this long-term strategy will ultimately provide
the revenues that are needed to improve public safety services in Fresno County

Thanks, again, for your time and I look forward to hearing from you soon

SUBJECT: Adoption of Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:

1. Hold first hearing on ordinance to propose transient occupancy tax at the
rata of six percent (6%), pursuant to Revenue and Taxation Code section
7230 et seq., and waive reading of ordinance in its entirety; and

Z Set second hearing for August 3,2004.

3.	Direct staff to prepare an agreement with the appropriate entity for the

reimbursement of election costs of a Transient Occupancy Tax Measure.

FISCAL IMPACT:

One of the six changes to the proposed Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) Ordinance
directed by your Board on July 13, 2004 was the inclusion of a maintenance of effort
provision. If a TOT measure is placed on the November 2, 2004 election and if it is
passed by the voters, this provision would commit your Board to allocate each year
$200,000 to finance tourism promotion activities. This requirement would be in place

during the term of the TOT, Under the current text of the revised ordinance, the term of
the TOT would be seven years.

The proposed ordinance provides that the election expense (estimated at $40,000 to
$60,000) would be paid from the proceeds of the tax, if the election is successful Your
Board and the proponents of the tax concurred on this approach during discussion of
this item on June 8,2004.

If passage of the measure fails, representatives of the Regional Jobs Initiative have
indicated that they would reimburse the County for the cost of the election.

They are requesting that a payment schedule be authorized by your Board. The terms
and conditions of a payment plan would need to be reflected in an agreement between
the County and the tax proponents. Depending on your Board's direction today, if the
proposed ordinance is approved and advanced to the second hearing on August 3,
2004, an agreement to reimburse the County for the cost of the election should be
presented to your Board for approval consideration on August 3,2004.

The current draft ordinance assumes a 6%Transient Occupancy Tax as proposed by
the Regional Jobs Initiative representatives. At this level, it is estimated that this tax
would generate annual revenue of $ 489,000. However, other higher estimates am
being cited by the Regional Jobs Initiative and John Harris who may have more specific
information.

DISCUSSION:

On June 8, 2004 your Board directed staff to work with representatives of the Fresno
Regional Jobs Initiative in the development of a draft ordinance and resolution to place
a Transient Occupancy Tax measure on the November 2,2004 ballot

On July 13,2004 your Board conducted a hearing and received public testimony on a
draft Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance. The tax proposal considered by your Board
on July 13,2004 included a 6% tax and the proceeds of this tax were to be used for the
promotion of tourism.

The tax would apply to ail temporary-lodging places. The ordinance lists the facilities
that would be subject to the proposed tax: “any hotel, inn, bed and breakfast tourist
home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house,
apartment house, dormitory, public or private dub, mobile home or house trailer at a
fixed location, camp site or RV park space in a private facility, houseboat or other
similar structure or portion thereof."

At your Board's July 13,2004 meeting, your Board directed staff to incorporate into the
draft TOT ordinance six items requested by representatives of the Fresno Regional
Jobs Initiative. Those items include:

1.	The tax shall not apply to organized residential camps
Z The tax shall not apply to meals or recreational amenities that may be
Included in packages offered by a lodging facility

3.	The ordinance should include a sunset clause similar to that of the
Library Sales Tax Measure. (Seven years).

4.	The ordinance should not have an escalator clause.

5.	The ordinance should include a maintenance of effort provision.

6.	Employee housing should be exempt

The terns requested by the Fresno Regional Jobs Initiative have been incorporated into the TOT
ordinance as directed by your Boant A revised ordinance is avafabie for the first hearing
consideration by your Board today.

On July 13. 2004 your Board continued this matter to the July 27, 2004 meeting and
asked that the representatives of the Regional Jobs Initiative meet with Mr. Harris to
seek agreement on the proposed TOT ordinance. Under the draft ordinance considered
by your Board on July 13, 2004, ail of the proceeds from the tax measure would be
earmarked to fund the promotion of tounsm. Mr. Hams shared his concerns that public
safety needs were crucial in the area where his hotel is located and using a portion of
the TOT revenues could better serve the 1-5 region and his operation.

On July 16. 2004 County staff convened a meeting of representatives from the Regional
Jobs Initiative and the Hams Ranch. Also present, having expressed an interest in the
meeting, were staff from the Greater Fresno Area Chamber of Commerce and the
Fresno Business Council. Supervisor Juan Arambula and County staff were also in
attendBnce. After sharing perspectives and information, the parties agreed to have
further discussions and inform County staff of the outcome by July 21, 2004. At that
meeting, County staff also distributed a copy of the draft ordinance that included the six
revisions directed by your Board.

On July 21, 2004 County staff was notified by the Regional Jobs Initiative that no
agreement had been reached between the parties and that RJl would provide an update
to your Board on any further developments at your July 27, 2004 meeting.

Should your Board decide to proceed with the ordinance, your Board may also choose
to approve recommendation Number 3 that directs staff to negotiate an agreement with
the appropriate entity for the reimbursement of the cost of the election if the tax
measure fails. RJl representatives have indicated that approval of a 12-month pay back

Board of Supervisors
July 27, 2004
Page 4

period would be requested from your Board. They had previously offered to reimburse
the County the cost of the ballot measure should It fail.

Voter Approval Requirement

A special-purpose tax such as a TOT dedicated to tourism funding requires the approval
of a simple majority of your Board and two-thirds of the voters.

The ordinance provides that if two-thirds of the voters approve the tax in November
2004, it will become effective on January 1, 2005.

Subject to your Board's direction and adoption of the proposed ordinance, a resolution
to place the TOT on the ballot will be scheduled for your Boards August 3.2004,
meeting. In order to place this measure on the November 2. 2004 election, the
ordinance and resolution would have to be delivered to the County Clerk by August 0,
2004.

OTHER AGENCY INVOLVEMENT-

Copies of this agenda item and the proposed TOT Ordinance were provided to
representatives of the Regional Jobs Initiative, the Fresno County Tourism Committee,
and other interested individuals and organizations.

(d)	If any operator liable for any amount under this chapter sells out the
business or quits the business, his or her successors or assigns shall withhold
sufficient of the purchase price to cover such amount until the former owner
produces a receipt from the Tax Collector showing that ha or she has been paid
or a certificate stating that no amount is due. If the purchaser of a business fails

shall either issue the certificate or mail notice to the purchaser at his or her
address as it appears on the records of the Tax Collector of the amount that must
be paid as a condition of issuing the certificate. Failure of the Tax Collector to
mail the notice will release the purchaser from any further obligation to withhold
the purchase pnce as above provided. The time within which the obligation of a
successor may be enforced shall start to run at the time the operator sells out the
business or at the time that the determination against the operator becomes final,

Dear Chairman Anderson:

The Board of Directors of the Greater Fresno Area
Chamber supports the proposed TLC ordinance for tourism
promotion in Fresno County. We are in support because we
feel it is the fairest way to assure some direct benefit,
in addition to the many indirect benefits, to all the
lodging facilities whose guests would be paying the lodging
charge.

Tourism represents a significant potential for
economic activity and job creation in Fresno County. The
economic opportunities for the County through tourism
promotion has been labeled everything from "a sleeping
giant" to "low hanging fruit ripe for picking".

Fresno County must move forward with a dedicated
funding stream for adequate tourism promotion. This
position is consistent with our support of the Regional
Jobs Initiative as well as our Chamber's mission to
"promote business and enhance the economic and cultural
well being of the people of Fresno County."

Sincerely,

Steve Newvine

Dear Supervisor Waterston

The Shaver Lake Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors has reviewed the Regional
Jobs Initiative proposal to create a new tourism authority and reinstate the Travelers
Lodging Charge (transient occupancy tax or hotel/motel bed tax) at a level of 6% It is
our understanding that revenues from the Travelers Lodging Charge will be used to
promote tourism and will not go in the County’s general fund

The Board of Directors voted to support the new tourism authority and the 6% Travelers
Lodging Charge (TLC) with the following provisos

1	We would prefer a 5-year sunset clause for the TLC instead of a 7-year sunset
clause

2	At least two representatives from the Shaver Lake area should be allowed to
participate m - and negotiate - the composition of the board of directors of the
new authority We believe the success of this effort will be directly related to the
composition of the tounsm authority board and members should be chosen for
their ability to have a long-term vision for the region and expertise within the
industry

3	It is critical that a proportionate share of the TLC funds be used to promote
resort destinations like Shaver Lake

4	We find the concept of tourism grants similar to those awarded in Kern County to
be particularly appealing as a way to enhance various local community marketing
efforts

We hope you will support the TLC ordinance at your hearing on July 27 and that our
comments will be taken into consideration as the new tourism authority enters the process
of formation

Sincerely,

Kevin Christiansen

Travelers Lodging Charge or other funding for tourism

I urge you to fund tourism, either by reinstating the transient occupancy tax (also
known as the Travelers Lodging Charge) or by finding another funding source With
adequate funding, tourism will benefit local businesses and our economy, increase
tax revenues for government services, and create much-needed jobs

I believe that our region has many assets that would result in a dramatic mcrease in
tourism if we promoted those assets. The tune has arrived to promote Fresno
County

In these austere fiscal times, the Travelers Lodging Charge is the best and most
logical source of funding for tourism All but one other county m California has a
transient occupancy tax and many are using the proceeds to attract tourists If Fresno
County would follow the model that’s been successful for Kern County, almost

7,000	new jobs would be created, visitor spending would increase by $113 million,
and an additional $8 million in sales tax revenues would be generated. That would
be a significant economic benefit to everyone m the County,

RE:	Regional	Jobs Initiative Tourism Cluster

Travelers Lodging Charge or other funding for tourism

I urge you to fund tourism, either by reinstating the transient occupancy tax (also known as the
Travelers Lodging Charge) or by finding another funding source With adequate funding,
tourism will benefit local businesses and our economy, increase tax revenues for government
services, and create much-needed jobs In these austere fiscal times, the Travelers Lodging
Charge is the best and most logical source of funding for tourism All but one other county in
California has a transtent occupancy tax and many are using the proceeds to attract tourists If
Fresno County would follow the model that’s been successful fbr Kem County, almost 7,000
new jobs would be created, visitor spending would increase by SI 13 million, and an additional
$8 million in sales tax revenues would be generated That would be a significant economic
benefit to everyone in the County

Thank you for your consideration

I.	OVERVIEW OF TOURISM FOR THE GREATER FRESNO AREA

A.	For decade’s community leaders have recognized the incredible
potential for the tourism industry in this area.

B.	A tourism bureau was established in the early 1980’s. This
eventually was combined with the Convention Bureau to form the
existing Convention and Visitors Bureau. For whatever reason,
tourism has never been a major focus by this organization

C.	Numerous efforts have been launched to bring focus to tourism.
Most recently:

1.	Fresno County launched an effort in the late 1990’s.

2.	The Greater Fresno Area Chamber of Commerce made it a
focal point of their agenda in 2001, 2002 and 2003.

3.	In 2002 Sprague and Associates was hired as a consultant
by the County of Fresno to assess the tourism industry and
its economic potential for the area.

4.	The Great Valley Center formed a Travel Informational
Economic Magnets Project Team in 2003.

5.	Fresno County established an Office of Tourism in 2002.

6.	The Regional Jobs Initiative recognized the value of tourism
and made it one of their focus areas in 2003

II.	POTENTIAL SLEEPING GIANT

A.	With little to no attention paid, tourism is the second largest
industry in this region.

1.	Tourism is the largest industry in California.

2.	Agriculture is the largest industry in this area.

3.	The Fresno area does not compete for our fair share of the
tourism trade.

, B. Assets: No massive investments need to be made. The attractions
are already here or close by.

1.	Overwhelming beauty in Three National Parks

a.	Yosemite National Park

b.	Kings Canyon National Park

c.	Sequoia National Park

2.	Abundance of lakes, rivers and streams

3.	Big cities and quaint small communities

4.	Close to 250 existing local attractions

a.	theatres

b.	museums

c.	historic sites

d.	galleries

e.	recreation areas

f.	sports venues

g.	casinos

h.	cultural events

5.	Snow and water skiing

a.	camping

b.	fishing

c.	hiking

6.	Pacific Ocean

a.	Monterey - Carmel - short drive

b.	Hearst Castle - short drive

c.	San Francisco - short drive

Visit there and stay here in a central location.
Amtrak adventure over and back.

Extension of a central California visit.

7.	Wine Country Close by

Visit there and stay here in a central location

III.	BENEFITS

A.	Job Creation

1.	The available labor base is ideally suited to the service
industry provided by tourism.

2.	Training in the basic skills required is minimal and
available.

3.	Once trained and given job experience this labor force can

expect to move up to more challenging positions, thus
creating a siphon effect for job availability for the ever
increasing population.

B.	Economic Development

1.	New wage earner spending promotes growth in all areas of
the community.

2.	With increased visitors will come the opportunity to expand
existing attractions, and attract additional new ones.

3.	Tourism spending could easily impact the local economy by
over $1 billion per year.

C.	Crime Reduction

1.	High un-employment fosters criminal activity. Employment
fosters responsibility.

2.	Crime and poverty do not recognize geographical
boundaries. This a regional problem,

a.	Image of the community will be vastly improved
externally.

b.	Image of the community will be vastly improved
internally.

D.	Self Esteem

1.	When we start promoting our assets, our community will
recognize how fortunate we are to live here.

2.	All citizens become ambassadors and sales persons for this
community.

IV.	THE FACTS ABOUT TOURISM

A.	Per the California State Department of Commerce, Fresno County
tourism generates $797 million to the local economy and
generates 14,000 jobs.

1.	This community, with all its assets, spends only $1.2
million per year to promote this industry.

2.	With very little effort and investment, this economic impact
could double and triple.

3.	Employment would double and triple as a result.

a.	14,000 jobs become 28,000 jobs.

b.	14,000 jobs become 42,000 jobs.

4.	Other services required by these additionally employed
persons would increase employment in other areas.

5.	These tourists do a lot more than pay room taxes.

B.	Sprague and Associates Tourism Master Plan

1.	Ted Sprague and his associates assessed the tourism
industry and its economic potential by doing the following:

a.	Assessment of the Area

b.	Personal interviews of leaders

c.	Comparison to competition

d.	Facilitation of Leaders

2.	In his presentation to the County, Ted Sprague stated “Your
consultant has been most impressed with the tourism
potential of the area because of it’s nearby proximity to
Yosemite, a world renowned tourism attraction. Also the
quality of the Fresno County tourism attractions are varied
The people and individual leaders from both business and
government have been refreshing and sometimes visionary.
All in all these are the ingredients that make Sprague and
Associates state with confidence that the economicompact of
tourism in the Fresno areas can be dramatic and growing.”
Fresno's tourism industry is sitting on a Gold Mine. It is a
sleeping Giant.

3.	Sprague Recommendations

a.	PDPO (Pre, During, Post, Ongoing) Make the booked
conventions stay longer. Guests with increased
spouse and family attendance. Critical that the name
Yosemite be prominent in all marketing.

b.	WOW “Create a catalyst photo opportunity,
attraction in the downtown area that draws a

minimum of 300,000 people per year and stimulates
dramatic tourism growth in downtown Fresno and
throughout the entire area”. It must be first class and
relate to the food industry. It must be a photo
opportunity. He suggests using the Water Tower as a
tourism sales center.

c.	Convention and Visitors Bureau Realignment. This is
necessary to carry out the strategic marketing plan. A
Vice President of tourism must be created with equal
stature to a Vice President of Conventions. This is an
executive position with significant compensation.

d.	Golf Package. This is just waiting to happen. We
have over 25 first class courses with reasonable rates,
and reasonable lodging costs. This is done very
successfully elsewhere and doesn’t require any
infrastructure. The assets are here. Only marketing is
missing.

e.	Funding: Fresno is dramatically under-funded.

Fresno spends just over $1 million per year.
Sacramento spends $6 million, San Jose $8 million
and Long Beach $4.4 million. Des Moines, Iowa
spends almost four times what is spent to promote
tourism.

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SPRAGUE PLAN

A. Task forces were established for all five areas addressed in the
Master Plan.

1.	The WOW Committee is working to select the signature
project.

2.	The Golf Package is ready to roll out soon. It is being
administered by the Fresno County Office of Tourism.

3.	The Fresno Convention and Visitors Bureau rejected the
Sprague and Associates Master Plan. This in essence killed
the PDPO(Convention pre, during, post, ongoing) program.
Obviously it stopped investigation of the realignment
process.

4.	Funding methods area still being studied to support a

competitive tourism program.

VI. PLANNING SESSION OF REGIONAL JOBS INITIATIVE JULY 30,
2003.

A.	First and foremost, we must establish an Effective Tourism
Authority.

1.	Can be no focus without a dedicated organization

2.	Must identify stakeholders and get them engaged.

3.	Develop a regional marketing plan

4.	Establish specific measurable outcomes.

5.	Identify and promote existing attractions.

6.	Establish travel writers “fan tours”.

B.	Long Term Goals

1.	Identify this region as a tourist destination.

2.	Foster development of new attractions

3.	Community beautification

4.	Community pride

5.	Job creation

6.	Workforce development - job readiness

7.	Regional thinking

8.	More livable Community

C.	Projected Results

1.	Double number of overnight visitors in the area in five
years. Over 3 million pass by us each year.

2.	Double number of tourism related jobs in the area in five
years. This ads over 14,000 jobs.

3.	Significant crime reduction

4.	A more attractive community

5.	Valley Pride

Vn. SUMMARY

A. Development of an effective tourism program can have the largest

single impact on this community, with the least over all effort.

1.	If we continue as we have been, we will be competing with
Kern Ventura, Tulare, Sonoma and Eldorado Counties. Our
investment of a little over SI million returns approximately
$800 million to the economy. The return on each dollar
invested is over $7.50 in room taxes alone.

2.	If we increase our budget 50%, and work a little harder we
can compete with San Louis Obispo, and Santa Barbara
Counties. Our return on investment will be roughly $1
billion to the local economy. For another $600 thousand
invested we get an additional $200 million impact to the
economy. For every dollar invested, city room taxes alone
generate over $9.25.

3.	If we double our budget and work harder, we should
compete well with San Mateo, San Diego, Santa Clara and
Sacramento Counties. Our return now goes to roughly
$1.15 Billion. The additional $1.2 million returns an
additional $400 million in community impact, and each
dollar invested now returns over $11.50 in room taxes.

B.	We can’t afford to not do this.

1.	We must immediately work to insure a funding stream

2.	Once seed funding is established we must create a viable,
accountable. Tourism Authority.

C.	The Regional Jobs Initiative Tourism Component is roughly one
month old. There is momentum and enthusiasm. There will be
much more to come.

A coordinated and consistent offenng is not realized by accident, but instead through
careful management4

3.	tourism services suppliers: Destination marketing is pnmanly accomplished by a
large group of independent firms and agencies that work together to serve their
independent interests. Suppliers include both pnvatB sector firms (e g. a hotel), and
public sector agencies (e g. a public transportation department). Each pnvate sector
firm will behave in a way that maximizes its own return on investment, while public
sector agencies will act to maximize the effectiveness of their resources and to
accomplish their legislative mandate But because of the essential interdependence
of the players in the tounsm market5, destination tounsm service suppliers should -
and do - attempt to coordinate their marketing activities Even so, pnvate firms are
constrained from taking a long-term view of destination marketing by short-term profit
pressures and imperfect information6 Coordination is difficult to sustain because of
the inherent difficulty involved in perceiving the connection between individual
contnbutions and individual returns This inspires the need for a specialized public-
pnvate interest coordinator, who will not only coordinate strategy but also undertake
the expense of demonstrating the benefits of coordination It is this essential and
necessary expense that is most often forgotten when it is assumed that pnvate firms
and agencies will coordinate tounst policies

4.	the citizen: The ultimate authonty and beneficiary with regard to the development of
his or her home city The first mandate of destination marketing is to satisfy the long-
term needs and wants of its natural constituents the people who sustain the city and
give it life. Citizens are asked to host visitors and to harmonize their city's qualities

3	Branson’s individual offenngs work together to create a strong, coordinated value proposition live
country music shows, famous performers of past years, a fun and culturally enriching theme park, and
sporting and nature activities that are extremely well suited to the American Midwest target market

4	For example, the rejection of proposed gambling licensing in Branson demonstrates a senous decision
to preserve the character of the destination and to forgo the revenue and traffic growth which licensed
gambling would generate

5	One of the special characteristics of the tounsm market is that it is in the interest of a large number
suppliers to share the same customer E g , John Smith, a tounst coming to NYC, might get services
from an airline, one or more hotels, several museums, several restaurants, several retail stores, taxi
companies and public transportation companies, etc These various firms can optimize their profits or
other interests by together coordinating their complete 'marketing mixes’ products and services, pncing,
promotion, placement (distribution channels), etc.

8 In general, negative externalities result from a single firm acting to serve its own best interests in a way
that indirectly causes adverse effects on the market There are many potential negative externalities that
can ansa from the tounsm industry pollution, intra-industry negative advertising, price gauging and
other monopolistic behaviors

A positive externality is a benefit derived from a firm’s actions that the firm itself does not directly benefit
from providing To illustrate a 3-star restaurant opens in NYC, which especially attracts new visitors
seeking culinary expenences, airlines, hotels, and other suppliers will benefit from the increased traffic,
but the restaurant itself is not directly rewarded for these positive effects It recaves direct benefit only
from its own paying customers 8

TO:	Board of Supervisors

FROM:	Bart Bohn, County Administrate Officer

Dennis Marshall, Interim Cdfotfy Counsel
SUBJECT: Adoption of Transient Occupancy Tax	Ordinance

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:

1.	Hold first hearing on ordinance to propose transient occupancy tax at the
rate of six percent (6%), pursuant to Revenue and Taxation Code section
7280 et seq., and waive reading of ordinance in its entirety; and

2.	Set second hearing for August 3, 2004.

3.	Direct staff to prepare an agreement with the appropriate entity for the
reimbursement of election costs of a Transient Occupancy Tax Measure.

FISCAL IMPACT:

One of the six changes to the proposed Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) Ordinance
directed by your Board on July 13, 2004 was the inclusion of a maintenance of effort
provision if a TOT measure is placed on the November 2, 2004 election and if it is
passed by the voters, this provision would commit your Board to allocate each year
$200,000 to finance tourism promotion activities This requirement would be in place

during the term of the TOT. Under the current text of the revised ordinance, the term of
the TOT would be seven years.

The proposed ordinance provides that the election expense (estimated at $40,000 to
$60,000 ) would be paid from the proceeds of the tax, if the election is successful. Your
Board and the proponents of the tax concurred on this approach during discussion of
this item on June 8, 2004.

If passage of the measure fails, representatives of the Regional Jobs Initiative have
indicated that they would reimburse the County for the cost of the election.

They are requesting that a payment schedule be authorized by your Board. The terms
and conditions of a payment plan would need to be reflected in an agreement between
the County and the tax proponents. Depending on your Board’s direction today, if the
proposed ordinance is approved and advanced to the second hearing on August 3,
2004, an agreement to reimburse the County for the cost of the election should be
presented to your Board for approval consideration on August 3, 2004.

The current draft ordinance assumes a 6%Transient Occupancy Tax as proposed by
the Regional Jobs Initiative representatives. At this level, it is estimated that this tax
would generate annual revenue of $ 489,000. However, other higher estimates are
being cited by the Regional Jobs Initiative and John Harris who may have more specific
information.

DISCUSSION:

On June 8, 2004 your Board directed staff to work with representatives of the Fresno
Regional Jobs Initiative in the development of a draft ordinance and resolution to place
a Transient Occupancy Tax measure on the November 2, 2004 ballot.

On July 13, 2004 your Board conducted a hearing and received public testimony on a
draft Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance. The tax proposal considered by your Board
on July 13, 2004 included a 6% tax and the proceeds of this tax were to be used for the
promotion of tourism.

The tax would apply to all temporary-lodging places. The ordinance lists the facilities
that would be subject to the proposed tax: “any hotel, inn, bed and breakfast, tourist
home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house,
apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or house trailer at a
fixed location, camp site or RV park space in a private facility, houseboat, or other
similar structure or portion thereof."

At your Board’s July 13, 2004 meeting, your Board directed staff to incorporate into the
draft TOT ordinance six items requested by representatives of the Fresno Regional
Jobs Initiative. Those items include:

1. The tax shall not apply to organized residential camps

2. The tax shall not apply to meals or recreational amenities that may be
included in packages offered by a lodging facility

3.	The ordinance should include a sunset clause similar to that of the
Library Sales Tax Measure. (Seven years).

4.	The ordinance should not have an escalator clause

5.	The ordinance should include a maintenance of effort provision.

6.	Employee housing should be exempt.

The items requested by the Fresno Regional Jobs Initiative have been incorporated into the TOT
ordinance as directed by your Board. A revised ordinance is available for the first hearing
consideration by your Board today.

On July 13, 2004 your Board continued this matter to the July 27, 2004 meeting and
asked that the representatives of the Regional Jobs Initiative meet with Mr. Harris to
seek agreement on the proposed TOT ordinance. Under the draft ordinance considered
by your Board on July 13, 2004, all of the proceeds from the tax measure would be
earmarked to fund the promotion of tourism. Mr. Harris shared his concerns that public
safety needs were crucial in the area where his hotel is located and using a portion of
the TOT revenues could better serve the 1-5 region and his operation.

On July 16, 2004 County staff convened a meeting of representatives from the Regional
Jobs Initiative and the Harris Ranch. Also present, having expressed an interest in the
meeting, were staff from the Greater Fresno Area Chamber of Commerce and the
Fresno Business Council Supervisor Juan Arambula and County staff were also in
attendance. After sharing perspectives and information, the parties agreed to have
further discussions and inform County staff of the outcome by July 21, 2004. At that
meeting, County staff also distributed a copy of the draft ordinance that included the six
revisions directed by your Board.

On July 21,2004 County staff was notified by the Regional Jobs Initiative that no
agreement had been reached between the parties and that RJI would provide an update
to your Board on any further developments at your July 27, 2004 meeting.

Should your Board decide to proceed with the ordinance, your Board may also choose
to approve recommendation Number 3 that directs staff to negotiate an agreement with
the appropriate entity for the reimbursement of the cost of the election if the tax
measure fails. RJI representatives have indicated that approval of a 12-month pay back

Board of Supervisors

period would be requested from your Board. They had previously offered to reimburse
the County the cost of the ballot measure should it fail.

Voter Approval Requirement

A special-purpose tax such as a TOT dedicated to tourism funding requires the approval
of a simple majority of your Board and two-thirds of the voters

The ordinance provides that if two-thirds of the voters approve the tax in November
2004, it will become effective on January 1, 2005

Subject to your Board’s direction and adoption of the proposed ordinance, a resolution
to place the TOT on the ballot will be scheduled for your Board’s August 3, 2004,
meeting. In order to place this measure on the November 2, 2004 election, the
ordinance and resolution would have to be delivered to the County Clerk by August 6,
2004.

OTHER AGENCY INVOLVEMENT:

Copies of this agenda item and the proposed TOT Ordinance were provided to
representatives of the Regional Jobs Initiative, the Fresno County Tourism Committee,
and other interested individuals and organizations.
