^	ANALYSIS OF4ISMBEii==;;=^

By DeWitt W. Clinton, County Counsel

In 1974, voters of, the William S. Hart Union High School District approved an
increase in the maximum tax rate not to exceed $0.0525 on each $100 of assessed
valuation with the proceeds used to finance improvements on the campus of
William S. Hart High School. The tax rate approved in 1974 is effective through
the 2000/01 fiscal year.

Approval of Measure H would authorize the District to use the proceeds of this
previously approved voter tax levy to finance additional improvements at the Hart,
Canyon, Saugus, Valencia and Bowman High Schools, and the Arroyo Seco,
Placerita, La Mesa and Sierra Vista Junior High Schools. This measure will not
increase the existing tax rate.

A majority vote is required for passage of the measure.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE H

Santa Clarita is known for the high quality of iff schools. However, that quality is
being eroded. Damage from the Northridge earthquake, lack of computer and
science technology, and increased vandalism are taking their toll on our schools.

Your YES vote on Measure H will allow our school district to extend the use of
a previously authorized levy to ensure the continuation and improvement of the
high educational standards of our community’s schools.

The facts are:

— Our instructional technology is inadequate. Our schools are without adequate
facilities to teach today’s skills. Measure H will give our students computers,
upgraded science labs, and instructional technology centers to prepare them for
high-tech jobs of the future.

—	Ow schools suffered significant damage from the Northridge earthquake. j

Measure H will allow more complete repait of this damage and will improve tie |
earthquake safety of classrooms at each school.

—	School security must be improved. The overall security of our campuses is
critical, both to our students and our community. Measure H will fund upgraded
security systems making each campus safer and protecting the community’s
investment in school facilities.

—	Local solutions are necessary for local problems. We can no longer rely on
State funding to solve our schools’ problems. Measure H will allow funding for
needed facilities and educational improvements. Perhaps less obvious is the benefit
of high property values resulting from good schools.

Our schools are a vital part of our community. A YES vote on Measure H will f
benefit all of Santa Clarita and provide our students with a safe and healthy |
educational environment and help prepare them for the future.	f

E

Please invest in our young people and our community by voting YES on f
Measure H.	|

REBtfffSErTO^ftSyWENT IISLFAVOR OF MEASURE H

DON’T BE-FOOLED! MEASURE H.............IS.A HUGE ...PROPERTY TAX

INCREASE!

The combination of evasive wording, scare tactics and outright falsehoods cooked
up by the other side is an insult to this community. Hart District schools, two of
which are brand new, already receive generous public support.

Political tricks aside, the case for higher taxes disappears after honest examination
of the facts.

—	Earthquake damage is not an issue. Needed rebuilding has already been funded.
In truth, Hart District administrators would now like you to pay for various non-
academic amenities (food courts, deluxe athletic facilities, cooler air conditioning)
which the state and federal governments rejected as being way beyond "earthquake
repairs".

—	There is no significant evidence that overall school security is inadequate; This
area has one of the lowest crime rates in the country.

-	How can the instructional technology be called "inadequate" in schools admitted
to be of "high quality"? Instead of spending tax dollars on political consultants,
maybe the administrators should be putting more money into our classrooms.

-	MEASURE H HAS NO SET DOLLAR LIMIT. Traditionally, school bonds
were sought to raise a specific amount of taxes for clearly defined uses. Not this
time. Projects will simply be created as long as there is money to spend. That
situation would invite abuse.

DON’T GIVE POLITICIANS AND SCHOOL BUREAUCRATS AN OPEN
CHECKBOOK!

Many of those who supported legitimate school bond campaigns in the past are
outraged at the deception behind Measure H. Don’t fall for it!

Vote NO on Measure H.

ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE H

We are dismayed that the Hart High School District would attempt to sneak a
major tax increase past this community at a time of such great financial strain for
most of us. The measure before you is a blatant effort to avoid the approval
required by Proposition 13 for new property taxes. Worst of all, the district used
our own tax dollars to hire consultants, lawyers, and financial advisors to help
them raise still more taxes!

First, these outsiders concocted a survey to identify people’s "hot buttons." Now
they are trying to manipulate us with a deceptively worded ballot measure and a
campaign funded and directed by political hacks, not parents.

This ballot measure was not motivated by any specific need. Unlike the bonds
approved in 1974, which were intended for school construction, this new tax will
simply pay for a wish list of desirable but non-essential projects and upgrades.
None will be subject to further voter review or approval. The district has been
carefully coached by its consultants, so 4here is no mention of the many
recreational amenities and food service enhancements it actually intends to
construct. Instead we get absurd justifications about gang prevention and
earthquake repairs. Intelligent voters realize that gang violence is a social problem
that cannot be influenced by fancier school campuses. Earthquake damage has
already been funded with state and federal dollars which were appropriately
provided as soon as needed.

At a tax rate of $52.50 for every $100,000 of assessed valuation, few homeowners
in this district will pay only $60 extra per year as claimed by the crafty sponsors
of this surcharge. Annual assessments of $100-$200 per household for the next six
years will be common.

Taxes raised deceptively will probably be spent the same way.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGATNffT0llA5URE~H ™

Measure H projects are critical to our children’s future:

-	At Placerita, covered walkways in danger of collapse from earthquake damage
are fenced off so students must run in the rain to get from class to class. FEMA
won’t pay for all this work.

-	At Saugus, students have access to computers less than 30 minutes per week
because of their scarcity and then, many must work on Apple He’s, obsolete
computers over 17 years old.

-	As vandalism increases in the District, even new schools like La Mesa, have
woefully inadequate security.

-	At Canyon, science students are using some of the same laboratory equipment
used by students when Carter was president.

Sadly, our district cannot afford to fix these problems without taking significant
money away from the classroom. Our district has a carefully prepared plan to
invest in these needed repairs and upgrades for ALL DISTRICT SCHOOLS.

With shrinking state budgets, California ranks 41st among the states in per pupil
expenditures and 48th in technology. Will our students be prepared for the high-
tech jobs of the 21st Century? We must turn to our community for some short-term
help.

Parent volunteers from around this valley have formed Citizens for Better Schools
to support passage of Measure H, a campaign funded solely by contributions.

For the sake of our kids and the future of our community - help us keep the very high
standards that are the benchmark of Santa Clarita Schools. Vote for Measure H!
