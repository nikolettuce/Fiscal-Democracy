CITY AnORNEY'S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
REGARDING CITY CODE SECTION 24-104
MEASURE T

Section 24-104 of the Oroville City Code presently imposes a tax of Six (6%) percent
of the amount of the rent on each transient who occupies a hotel or motel room within the
City. A transient is defined in City Code section 24-103 as a person who occupies such a
room for a period less than thirty 130) consecutive days. All monies collected are deposited
in the City's general fund.

Measure "T", if approved by the voters, would make several substantive changes to Section
24-104. The rate of tax would be increased to Nine 19%) and the tax collected would be
divided between the City's general fund, which would receive one-half of the tax monies collected,
a separate fund to be utilized solely for a Visitor/Tourism program which would receive thirty-
seven and one-half (37.5%) percent and a separate fund to be utilized solely for Community
Promotions, which would receive the other twelve and one-half 112.5%) percent.

Since this measure would impose a tax for a special purpose, i.e. for a Visitor ITourism
program and a Community Promotions program, the approval of two-thirds of the voters is
required for passage pursuant to section 53722 of the California Government Code.

City Attorney

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF
MEASURE T

Passage of Measure T in November will be a vote FOR Oroville. It's a vote FOR increased
funds for Community programs. It's a vote FOR increased promotion of Oroville.

Measure T is NOT taxing the citizens of Oroville. The Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT)
is NOT paid by local citizens. It's paid by visitors utilizing our local hotels, motels, and bed
& breakfasts.

Currently there are no guarantees that TOT'funds will be available to local organizations.
Measure T will guarantee how TOT funds can be spent as designated in City of Oroville Resolution
4721, which provides for 50% of the total TOT funds/ to be spent on visitor and tourism
promotion and community programs.

The City's general fund, hit hard by the current economic climate, will see increased revenues.

More can and should be done to expand Oroville's Visitor and Tourism industry and to
promote the recreational opportunities in our community. Local organizations and groups need
funds for various activities. Measure T can provide the funds necessary to accomplish these
things.

Dollars brought into Oroville through visitor and tourists, are circulated several times in
our communtiy, benefiting us all. Businesses will be more profitable, generating more services
for our citizens.

Increased visitor and tourism/ activity will also increase the amount of funds available
through TOT in years to come, providing more money for additional visitor and tourism promotions
and community projects.

Vote YES FOR OROVILLE by voting YES on Measure T on November 3rd.
