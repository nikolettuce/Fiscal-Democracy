ANALYSIS OF PROPOSITION F
By De Witt W. Clinton, County Counsel

Approval of this ballot proposition would allow the San Marino Unified
School District to impose a special tax of up to $100 per year upon each parcel
of real property within the District. The Governing Board of the District may
exempt parcels used solely for owner-occupied single family residential
purposes by persons 65 years of age or older, and may treat as a single parcel
contiguous parcels used solely for owner-occupied single family residential
purposes.

The maximum permissible yearly tax may not be exceeded in any year in which
the tax is assessed, but may be lower. The lax would be levied for a four-year
period.

The tax would be used to recruit and retain qualified teachers, maintain and
improve existing classroom facilities, and provide classroom programs to
achieve higher academic standards of performance.

The approval of the proposition would also allow the District to increase the
legal ceiling on expenditures currently imposed by the State Constitution. This
increase in the ceiling is limited to four (4) years, without additional voter
approval.

A two-thirds vote is required for passage of the proposition.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION F

For over a decade, the San Marino Unified School Disirict has suffered from
consistent State underfunding. Partly through the extraordinary efforts of the
San Marino Schools Foundation, the PTAs and civic organizations, our
schools have been able to continue to offer an excellent educational program.
However, these efforts could NOT replace the cumulative effects of the State’s
underfunding which have caused cutbacks in programs and staff, salary levels
among the lowest in Los Angeles County and a deterioration of District
facilities. With the State fiscal deficit for next year, our schools will again be
seriously underfunded.

PROPOSITION “F” ADDRESSES THESE CONCERNS

FACT: Quality schools benefit ALL homeowners, whether or not they have
children in school. Property values, and the quality of life in our community,
arc directly tied to the maintenance of quality schools.

FACT: Our current level of educational excellence cannot be sustained
without further community financial support to supplement the inadequate
Slate funds.

FACT:	Over 97% of the residents polled in a recent survey desire quality

public education in the San Marino Unified School District.

FACT:	Proposition “F” addresses the concerns of Senior Citizens residing

in the District by allowing homcowners-residcnts over 65 to obtain an exemp-
tion from this tax upon application to the Board of Education.

FACT:	Proposition “F” also addresses the concerns of residents owning

contiguous parcels used solely for owner-occupied residences by, on applica-
tion, treating those parcels as a single parcel for tax purposes.

FACT: A YES vote on Proposition “F” will restore a degree of local control
and will provide our School District with the resources necessary to meet some
of the major challenges facing San Marino Schools.

THE ABOVE FACTS COMPEL BUT ONE CONCLUSION. VOTE YES ON
PROPOSITION “F”.
