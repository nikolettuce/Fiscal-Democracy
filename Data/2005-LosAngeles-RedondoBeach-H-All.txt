IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF PROPOSITION H

A BALLOT MEASURE TO ADJUST THE BUSINESS

LICENSE TAX BY THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX

The City of Redondo Beach’s ordinance currently
authorizes the City to impose an annual license tax on
businesses which provide goods and services in the City
of Redondo Beach, in varying rates depending on the
classification of the business. The business license tax
rates were last adjusted in 1991.

Proposition H, if adopted, would amend the City’s
ordinance to authorize the City to establish an annual
Consumer Price Index (CPI) adjustment to the rates of
the business license tax, beginning in July 2005.

/s/ Jerry Goddard City Attorney

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION H

The price of everything keeps changing - food,
gasoline, utilities. The government measures the annual
change in our cost of living with the Consumer Price
Index (CPI).

Despite the City staff’s best efforts, costs for our City
have been increasing; materials, maintenance, salaries ali
keep escalating. One thing, however, has not increased
in Redondo Beach since 1991 -- the fee for operating a
business.

The business license fee in Redondo Beach is among
the lowest not only in the South Bay, but also throughout
Los Angeles County. Since the fee was last changed
the CPI has increased more than 40%. The cost for
City services provided to businesses and to the public
continues to rise. The City pays more for Police, Fire,
roads, parks, senior services and transit. The business
license fee has not kept pace with the cost for providing
the services from which businesses benefit.

The Chamber of Commerce surveyed its members and
more than 55% agreed that a modest business license fee
increase was justified. In fact, the chair of the Chamber
Board has signed below in support of Proposition H.

It is proposed that the business license fee should be
indexed for inflation by annually adjusting at the same
rate as costs change. This can be accomplished by
multiplying the fee by the CPI. This modest change will
ensure that businesses pay a fair share of the costs for
the services they use within the City.

Maintain a balanced approach to revenues in Redondo
Beach. Vote Yes on Proposition H.

/s/ Don Szerlip

Redondo Beach Councilman, District 3
/s/ Ann M. Garten, Resident
/s/ John Parsons

Redondo Beach Councilman, District 5

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF
PROPOSITION H

The proponents of Proposition H correctly state in
their ballot argument that: “The business license fee has
not kept pace with the cost for providing the services
from which our businesses benefit.” It is true that the
costs of operating our City have increased significantly
since 1991, the last time the City raised the business li-
cense tax. Unfortunately, Proposition H will do virtually
nothing to solve the problem the proponents have identi-
fied. The City’s outmoded business license tax system is
unfair to residents, who shoulder a greater tax burden for
providing City services, and fails to provide tax relief for
small businesses. We need to have real business license
tax reform — not a knee-jerk tax increase that proba-
bly won’t raise enough revenue to pay for itself. Voters
should reject Proposition H because it does not do the
job the proponents want it to do. Let’s send city officials
back to devise a business license tax reform package
that the voters can approve on a future ballot. Vote “NO”
on Proposition H. It doesn’t get the job done.

Redondo Beach Councilman, District 4

ARGUMENT AGAINST PROPOSITION H

(Business License Tax Increase)

The City of Redondo Beach needs business license
tax reform, not an endless series of automatic annual tax
increases based on the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”).
The City’s business license tax system is outmoded
and unnecessarily complicated. We need to reform the
business license tax so that it (1) generates sufficient
revenue to pay for municipal services and improvements;
and (2) isfairto all businesses. Proposition H accomplishes
neither of these goals. All it does is keep the same flawed
system in place with automatic tax increases each year
based on the CPI. Our residents and businesses deserve
better than this. Let’s reform our business license tax
so that it: (1) generates reasonable revenue to the City;

(2)	eliminates loopholes and complicated classification
systems; and (3) offers tax relief to small businesses. The
voters should reject Proposition H so that city staff and
the Budget & Finance Commission can put together a
business license tax reform package for review by the
city council and, ultimately, approval by the voters within
the next two years. Proposition H is a prime example of
a knee-jerk tax increase that does not address the needs
of our City, its residents or the business community. Vote
“NO” on Proposition H. We can do much better.

/s/ Kurt Schmalz

Redondo Beach Councilman, District 4

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST
PROPOSITION H

Proposition H is a reasonable and prudent way for the
business license fee to adjust to meet the City’s costs
for providing services. Since no change has been made
to the fixed rates since 1991, it is hardly a knee jerk
reaction.

An overwhelming number of businesses in Redondo
Beach pay a simple license fee based upon $99/year
plus $18/employee. This fee is not a major burden on
small businesses.

There are a group of miscellaneous business
classifications in the code that pay varying fees. Prior
to putting this proposition on the ballot, the City Council
directed staff to revamp these categorizations in order to
simplify the system. The results: 57 designations were
reduced to only 9. This action made the City’s code
more fair and eliminated loopholes and complicated
classifications.

There is no immediate need to completely overhaul
Redondo Beach’s business license fee. Redondo Beach
remains among the lowest cost municipalities in Southern
California within which to operate a business. Should
the City Council, City staff or the Budget and Finance
Commission wish to propose a new system, they can
at any time. For now, adding an annual CPI adjustment
to the fee schedule will serve to ensure that businesses
meet the changing costs for the services provided to
them by the City.

The Chamber of Commerce, representing its local
business membership, supports Proposition H. So
should you.

Vote YES on Proposition H.
