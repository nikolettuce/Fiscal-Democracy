
<impartial> ANALYSIS OF PROPOSITION C


Approval of Proposition. C would authorize the Los Angeles County
Transportation Commission to adopt a one-half of 1 percent transactions and
use tax (commonly called a “sales tax”).

Funds received from the tax would be used for public transit purposes,
including the operation, maintenance, security, improvement and expansion
of public bus and rail transit systems and facilities, fare subsidies, and the
maintenance and improvement of streets and highways used by public transit

This measure also provides that in the event this measure and the tax proposed
by the Los Angeles County Regional Justice Facilities Financing Agency
(Proposition A) are both approved by the electorate, the tax will be divided
equally between the Commission and the Agency, if legislation is adopted to
authorize the division. If at some future time the statutory limit on sales taxes
is increased, the full one-half of 1 percent will be restored to the Commission
and the Agency.

This measure also establishes an appropriations limit for the Commission.
This measure requires a majority vote for passage. <impartialend>

<favor> ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION C

VOTE YES ON PROPOSITION C

Traffic congestion in Los Angeles County has become intolerable and is rapidly
bringing our county to a standstill.

PROPOSITION C WILL BRING PRACTICAL. QUICK ACTION TO
OUR TRANSPORTATION PROBLEMS

PROPOSITION C WILL:

—Expand rail service throughout Los Angeles County in all directions
using EXISTING rail lines, including those in the San Gabriel and San
Fernando valleys;

—Help bring new light rail to Los Angeles County communities much
faster than originally scheduled;

—Create a cost-efficient system of frequent, on-time buses; provide for
cleaner, graffiti-free and clean-fuel buses; and increase police protection
for transit throughout the county;

—Set up synchronized traffic signals on major streets so traffic flows
smoothly without stopping at so many red lights.

ALL THE MONEY RAISED IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WILL BE
SPENT ONLY IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY.

Local money will be spent on local projects. Cities will have a direct say in how
their share will be used to reduce congestion in their areas. Proposition C also
has an appropriation limit to protect taxpayers.

PROPOSITION C WILL HELP REDUCE AIR POLLUTION. CUT
DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL, AND SAVE LIVES.

Proposition C will help to make transit more available to Los Angeles County
commuters. If just 10 percent of the Los Angeles County workforce rode rail
and bus transit daily, over 200 tons per day of pollutants (including carbon
monoxide and hydro carbons) could be eliminated and the burning of millions
of gallons of gasoline every year could be reduced.

Reduced congestion will save lives by helping firefighters, police and medical
personnel reach their destinations more rapidly in life or death emergencies.

Join us in voting yes on C.

INCREASE RAIL LINES. REDUCE TRAFFIC CONGESTION.

<rebutfavor> REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION C

Nobody wants traffic congestion. Everybody wants more rail service and safer
highways. The issue again, however, is just how many tax increases we have
to endure to get what we have already paid for.

In June voters approved $5 billion for transportation projects and hiked their
gasoline tax by 9 cents.

This is in addition to the extra half-cent sales tax we already pay in Los Angeles
County for transit projects, which amounts to about $423 million just this year.

We were told these new taxes would pay for new highway, traffic and mass
transit projects, resulting in less traffic congestion, more rail service and safer
highways.

Now Mayor Bradley and other politicians want you to vote for yet another half-
cent sales tax increase.

Ask yourself: Despite all the millions of extra dollars committed to
transportation, are the freeways or your neighborhood less congested?

Bradley and the Los Angeles City Council have ignored suggested fiscal
reforms, including one that showed more than $400 million a year could be
saved if private contractors were used. That’s the same amount you are being
asked to approve in new taxes.

Send a message to the politicians: NO MORE TAXES until we get our
money’s worth for the taxes we have already paid.

<against> ARGUMENT AGAINST PROPOSITION C

Vote “No” on Proposition C

Do not allow Los Angeles politicians to dig deeper into your pockets when their
wallets are bulging with transportation dollars.

In June, 1990, the voters approved Propositions 108, 111, and 116, which raise
the gas tax nine cents and commit $5 billion for expenditures on transit and
the highway system in Los Angeles County.

What is sadder is that in 1980 the voters approved a one-half cent sales tax
increase and today $370 million sit unspent in the cities’ and the County’s bank
accounts.

Since the voters approved the one-half cent sales tax ten years ago, there has
not been a single major transportation improvement completed, with the
exception of the Long Beach rail system that cost $800 million more than
originally projected and has, in large measure, only diverted patronage from
existing RTD buses.

There has not been a single significant transportation project completed in the
San Gabriel Valley, the San Fernando Valley, West Los Angeles, the Santa
Clarita Valley or the cities in southeastern Los Angeles County with the more
than $2.5 billion raised thus far from the one-half cent sales tax.

Today, in downtown Los Angeles we have a Metro Rail tunnel to nowhere and
a series of transportation projects riddled with cost overruns and characterized
by mismanagement.

Do not be fooled again. Throwing money at a problem is no guarantee that
it will be solved. What is needed is less bureaucracy and some creative,
responsible approaches to reducing congestion that demonstrate an
understanding of our modern problems, not a rehash of failed programs and
policies.

<rebutagainst> REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST PROPOSITION C

If you think traffic congestion is bad now, remember that unless new steps are
taken, traffic congestion will double in the next ten years!

To cope with congestion, we have already begun to improve our mass transit
* system in Los Angeles County:

—	The Blue Line Metro from Long Beach is off to a great start - over 1
million riders have gotten ofT the road and onto rail.

—	Other new rail lines are underway.

—	Over 400 different traffic reduction projects - dial-a-ride, commuter
buses, and reduced fare programs - have been developed.

It’s a good start, but we need more action to fight gridlock and provide
alternatives to single passenger vehicles which tie up freeways and pollute our
air.

WE NEED PROPOSITION C TO:

Bring Light Rail faster than originally scheduled.

Allow Commuter Rail, within two years, to go through the San Gabriel Valley
and San Fernando Valley.

Provide a bus system that is safer, graffiti-free, on-time and clean-fueled.

Continue and expand services for seniors and the disabled.

Create a coordinated rail, bus, and highway system so people throughout Los
Angeles County can get out of their cars and onto transit.

We need Proposition C to stop traffic gridlock, reduce air pollution, CUT
DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL, and speed up the ability of police, fire
and emergency vehicles to get to their destination and save lives.

INCREASE RAIL LINES, REDUCE TRAFFIC CONGESTION.
