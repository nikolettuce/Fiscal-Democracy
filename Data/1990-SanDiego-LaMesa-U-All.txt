CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

In the City of La Mesa, a tax is charged for the privilege of occupying a hotel room for a period
of time no more than thirty consecutive days. The tax Is commonly referred to as a Transient
Occupancy Tax. At the present time, the tax is equivalent to eight percent (8%) of the rent
charged for the use of the hotel rooms. The purpose of this measure is to increase the tax to
ten percent (10%) of the rent charged. This tax applies only to “transient” occupancy of hotels
which means the tax is charged only when a person is occupying a hotel room for less than
thirty consecutive days. "Hotel" is defined as any structure, or any portion of any structure, which
is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or sleeping
purposes and is held out as such to the public. “Hotel” does not mean any hospital, convalescent
home or sanitarium. The revenue received from this tax will be used for general governmental
purposes and State law requires majority voter approval to increase this tax for general
governmental purposes.

if this measure is defeated, the Transient Occupancy Tax will remain at eight percent (8%).
If approved by the majority of the persons voting on this measure, this increase in tax shall take
effect on January 1,1991.

A “yes” vote means you are in favor of the increase of the Transient Occupancy Tax to ten
l^jf-ant (10%); a “no” vote means you are opposed to such an increase.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION U

THIS MEASURE WILL NOT COST LA MESA RESIDENTS ANY MONEY

WHAT IS THE TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX (TOT)?

This is a tax which visitors pay on the rent charged by hotel/motel operators. This is not a tax
on existing residents, homeowners or businesses.

WHAT WILL THE ADDITIONAL 2% BE USED FOR?

TOT revenues are defined as general purpose revenues and can be used to provide police, fire
and other critical services for the citizens of and visitors to La Mesa. The TOT tax increase will
allow for a fair and equitable method to assess those visitors who place special demands on
the general services of the City. Additionally, TOT is one of the very few revenue sources over
which our City has direct control.	'	■

HOW MUCH DIFFERENCE CAN 2% MAKE?

A 2% increase will not significantly affect a visitor’s hotel/motel bill or the demand for rooms
within La Mesa. A 2% increase on an assumed $50.00 room charge will only increase the room
rate by $1.00. A survey indicates that increased TOTs have generally not reduced occupancy
r| ’ •*) or revenues for the hotel/motel industry.

Proposition U will, however, contribute to the overall fiscal stability of the City of La Mesa and
help to continue the high level of service to which our citizens and visitors have become
accustomed without adversely affecting our local hotel/motel economy. A 2% increase will raise
substantial funds to assist the City in paying for those increased special demands placed on
the community by visitors.

TO the MAYt	MEMBERS	of	the	CITY	COUNCIL

From the CITY MANAGER

DATE;	July 24, 1990

SUBJECT;	Consideration	of	whether	or	not	the	City	Council

wishes to file an argument in favor of the ballot
measure regarding the increase in the Transient
Occupancy Tax.

ISSUING DEPARTMENT; City Clerk

SUMMARY

Issue:

Does the City Council wish to file a written argument with the
City Clerk in favor of the ballot measure to increase the
Transient Occupancy Tax or authorize a member or members to do
so?

Recommendation;

It is recommended that Council appoint a subcommittee of either
one or two Councilmembers to file the argument in favor.

Fiscal Impact;

The cost is estimated to be no more than $500 and has been
included in the 001-107-6420 account.

BACKGROUND:

Section 5013 of the Election Code authorizes the City Council, or any
member or members of the Council authorized by that body, or any
individual voter who is eligible to vote on the measure, or bona fide
association of citizens, or any combination of voters and associations to
file a written argument for or against any City measure.

At this point Council may decide if it wishes to submit an argument in
favor or authorize a member or members to submit an argument. Since the
argument is due on August 24th and two Councilmembers have already
indicated that they will be out of town at that time, it appears that it
would be appropriate to authorize one or two Councilmembers to submit the
argument in favor.

For Council’s information, the argument cannot exceed 300 words in
length. If an argument against the ballot measure is filed then whomever
files the argument in favor is authorized to file the rebuttal. It is due
in the City Clerk's office by 5 p.m. September 4th and may not exceed 250
words.

Also, Section 5016 of the Election Code provides that if more than one
argument is received either for or against a measure the City Clerk shall
give preference as follows:

(a)	The legislative body, or member of members of the
legislative body authorized by that body.

(b)	The individual voter or bona fide association of citizens,
or combination of voters and associations, who are the bona
fide sponsors or proponents of the measure.

(c)	Bona fide associations of citizens.

(d)	Individual voters who are eligible to vote on the measure.

Considering the fact that some Councilmembers will be out of town and
there will be two deadlines that must be met, I would recommend that
Council select either one or two members to be responsible for the
argument in favor of the ballot measure.
