ARGUik.-NT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE "00"

Measure "00" provides for a 2% increase in the present hotel, motel, or
similar accommodation Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) of 10%. (For
example: The current T.O.T. tax rate, per room night, for a $100.00 room
is 10% or $10.00 each room night to the cities General Fund. An increase
of 2% to 12% each room night adds $2.00 per room night to the cities
General Fund.) This tax is not paid by City residents or property owners
but by visitors who rent hotel, motel or similar accommodations, per room
night, for up to one month. City visitors and tourists would help to pay for
the many services they utilize, such as emergency services and road
transportation impacts that otherwise may be funded with residents’ tax
dollars and thus ensures that your tax dollars are used wisely.

Over the next ten years Measure "00“ will add an additional $200,000 to
the cities General Fund to pay for vital city services such as road projects,
senior care, youth programs and public safety.

We, the undersigned City Council Members feel this method is in the best
interest of the citizens to ensure that City visitors and tourists help pay for
the many services they utilize while visiting the City of Indio.
