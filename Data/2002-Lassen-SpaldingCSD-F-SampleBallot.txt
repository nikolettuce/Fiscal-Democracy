IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE F
BY COUNTY COUNSEL

SPALDING COMMUNITY SERVICE DISTRICT
WASTEWATER SYSTEM
SPECIAL TAX MEASURE F

This measure would authorize Spalding Community Service District
Wastewater System to assess a special property tax for each fiscal year at
rates set forth in the uniform schedule of rates adopted on August 6, 2002 by
the District, which schedule applies against property made up of four or more
lots, improved and unimproved real property and structures thereon, based
upon the use of the property which schedule is on file in the District office, for
expenses incurred in the pursuit of the construction of a new wastewater
system. Said rates would be subject to annual adjustments in an amount
equal to one percent (1%) of the tax rate applicable to the property during the
preceding year.

The special property taxes shall be collected in the same manner and subject
to the same penalties as County Property taxes are collected, except that in
fiscal year 2002-2003, the District may independently bill property owners for
the taxes due.

The measure will become effective upon the favorable vote of two-thirds of
the voters voting upon the measure. The measure will also authorize an
increase in the spending limits to the extent that the revenue from the special

property taxes are in excess of these limits in existence prior to the election.

John T. Ketelsen
Lassen County Counsel

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE F

In order to facilitate the District's Wastewater project the District needs th
monies derived from this measure for administrative expenses in pursuin'
additional grant monies and overcoming ongoing environmental hurdles. Th
cost to most residential property owners will only be $1.00 (one dollar) pe
month.

Non-passage of this measure will probably bring our sewer project to a ha!
The Spalding Sewer Project has come a long way. Design will be complete i
the near future, (design is 90% complete.) Property has been purchased for
land swap with the US Forest Service for a sewer pond site. Mos
environmental hurdles have been solved. The District is working on receivin'
grant funds from both the State and Federal Government for construction. Fc
the mere economical cost of $1.00 per month, let's not stop now.
