The Top Two Candidates Open Primary Act, which took effect January 1, 2011, requires that all candidates for a voter-nominated
office be listed on the same ballot. Voter-nominated offices are state legislative offices, U.S. congressional offices, and state
constitutional offices.

In both the open primary and general elections, you can vote for any candidate, regardless of what party preference you indicated
on your voter registration form. In the primary election, the two candidates receiving the most votes—regardless of party
preference—move on to the general election regardless of vote totals. If a candidate receives a majority of the vote (50 percent +
1), a general election still must be held. Even if there are only two candidates for an office in the open primary, a general election
for that office is still required.

California’s open primary system does not apply to candidates running for local offices.

Voter-Nominated Offices

Political parties are not entitled to formally nominate candidates for voter-nominated offices at the primary election. A
candidate nominated for a voter-nominated office at the primary election is the nominee of the people and not the official nominee
of any party at the general election. A candidate for nomination to a voter-nominated office shall have his or her party preference,
or lack of party preference, stated on the ballot, but the party preference designation is selected solely by the candidate and is
shown for the information of the voters only. It does not mean the candidate is nominated or endorsed by the party designated,
or that there is an affiliation between the party and candidate, and no candidate nominated by the voters shall be deemed to be
the officially nominated candidate of any political party. In the county sample ballot booklet, parties may list the candidates for
voter-nominated offices who have received the party’s official endorsement.

Any voter may vote for any candidate for a voter-nominated office, if they meet the other qualifications required to vote
for that office. The top two vote-getters at the primary election move on to the general election for the voter-nominated office even
if both candidates have specified the same party preference designation. No party is entitled to have a candidate with its party
preference designation move on to the general election, unless the candidate is one of the two highest vote-getters at the primary
election.

Nonpartisan State Offices

Political parties are not entitled to nominate candidates for nonpartisan offices at the primary election, and a candidate
at the primary election is not the official nominee of any party for the specific office at the general election. A candidate for
nomination to a nonpartisan office may not designate his or her party preference, or lack of party preference, on the ballot. The
top two vote-getters at the primary election move on to the general election for the nonpartisan office.

New electoral district boundaries are drawn every 10 years in order to equalize district populations. Boundaries for the
congressional, state legislative, and county supervisorial districts are now different. Boundary changes also apply to any city,
school district, or special district that votes by trustee areas or divisions. To see the new district maps, visit the Registrar of
Voters website at www.voteinfo.net.

California law requires that the following information be printed in this pamphlet.

CANDIDATE STATEMENT FOR
UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE,

36TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT

BRIAN NESTANDE, Republican	AGE:	50

OCCUPATION:	State Assemblyman / Businessman

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

Congress isn’t getting anything done, and the current Congress is
one of history's worst.

In Congress, I'll work to:

S Immediately secure the border as the FIRST step in immigration
reform

s STOP the overspending and pass a balanced budget
amendment

s Hold Congress accountable - no balanced budget = no
paycheck

s Create policies that encourage businesses to expand so we
have high quality good paying jobs

Middle class families cannot afford another do-nothing Congress. In
the last two years, Congress sent America another $2 trillion deeper
into debt - an amount equal to an additional $9,000 of debt per U.S.
taxpayer.

At the same time, the cost of healthcare under Obamacare has risen
by as much as fifty percent, and millions of seniors have seen their
Medicare benefits reduced.

Worker wages have remained stagnant, and more businesses are
moving off-shore as Congress debates adding even higher taxes and
more regulations.

My wife Gina and I are raising our family and we know first-hand how
difficult Washington is making it for middle class families to get ahead.

I’ll make sure the priorities of seniors and middle-class families
are put into action, and that's the difference. That’s why I’ve been
endorsed by most of the local elected leaders in our District - people
who understand how difficult it’s been to have a voice in Congress. I
would be honored to have your vote.

CANDIDATE STATEMENT FOR
STATE SENATOR,

28TH SENATORIAL DISTRICT

JEFF STONE, Republican

OCCUPATION:	Riverside County Supervisor / Small Business

Owner

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

As a Riverside County Supervisor and longtime small business
owner, I’m proud to be running for the Senate with the support of
local taxpayers, seniors, veterans, small business owners and over
45 city council members and elected officials from the Coachella
Valley and Riverside County. Councilman Glenn Miller, who ran a
strong campaign in June, has now endorsed me.

I’m also honored to be the choice of Riverside Countv Sheriff Stan Sniff
and the Riverside Sheriffs Association. Over 3,200 law enforcement
officers and investigators in Riverside County endorse me because
they know I will OPPOSE EARLY RELEASE of dangerous prisoners
and work to keep our neighborhoods, schools and homes safe.

I signed the NO NEW TAXES pledge. As a local official, I successfully
lowered taxes without cutting vital services. I’ll work to do the same
in Sacramento.

I strongly oppose the federal government’s policy of moving illegal
immigrants from the Texas border to Riverside County communities.
The Feds need to enforce the law and control the border.

My priorities are: JOB CREATION and Improving the Business
Climate; No New Taxes, Cut Waste and Balance the Budget.

Special interests in Sacramento are spending massive sums of
money to influence your vote and defeat me. Ask yourself: do you
want a Senator who will be a voice for the special interests; or one
who will be a voice for you and Riverside County?

I’d be honored to receive your vote. Please visit www.JeffStone2014.com
to read more. Thank you.

CANDIDATE STATEMENT FOR
STATE SENATOR,

28TH SENATORIAL DISTRICT

BONNIE GARCIA, Republican
OCCUPATION:	Small Business Woman

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

California is broken and in dire need of commonsense solutions.

During the six years I served in the Assembly, I kept my promise
and refused to support tax increases and reckless spending. My
commitment to California’s hardworking taxpayers earned me the
support of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association and local elected
officials from across the county.

A strong workforce is more important than senseless regulations. The
California Small Business Association supports me because I created
thousands of jobs, expanded opportunities for veterans and secured
funding for small businesses.

I’m from a law enforcement and military family, value freedom
and understand personal sacrifice. The California Police Chief’s
Association and Crime Victims United have endorsed me due to my
strong support of public safety and fervent opposition toward the
Governor’s early release program for hardened criminals.

We must focus on issues that directly affect the future of our state and
its industries: namely, our dwindling water supply. As your Senator, I
will fight to ensure that California’s water supply is readily available for
those who need it most: families and small businesses that depend
on this critical resource to create jobs and sustain our high standard
of living.

With your support I will continue to use my experience and degree in
Workforce Development and Education to promote a broad array of
conservative priorities - sound fiscal policies, quality schools, safer
communities and protecting the value of every life.

Experience and ethics matter.

CANDIDATE STATEMENT FOR
MEMBER OF THE STATE ASSEMBLY,

56TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT

EDUARDO GARCIA, Democratic
OCCUPATION:	Mayor / Legislative Director

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

As a lifelong resident of the Coachella Valley, a father, and a public
servant, I want what is best for our families, residents, and local
businesses.

I am running for State Assembly to fight for the issues that matter most
to our residents: strengthening our economy, improving neighborhood
schools, and building healthier, safer communities.

As a four-term Mayor of Coachella and policy director, I have a proven
track record of building coalitions with Republicans and Democrats to
deliver results and positive solutions for our community.

As Mayor, I work with business and labor to launch local job creation
initiatives. Under my watch, Coachella invested over $100 million in
public works projects - infrastructure and transportation, parks &
recreation, and a revitalized downtown. As a result, our city is a better
place to live, work, and raise a family. During the recession, when
other cities across the state made drastic cuts and slashed services,
our residents and tax dollars were protected because of the fiscal
safeguards I helped establish.

I’ve built partnerships between the city and community-based non-
profits to expand access to health care throughout the Coachella
Valley - work that was recognized by President Bill Clinton last year.

I have the experience and proven record as an effective leader
needed to fight for the Coachella Valley in the Legislature. Please join
Congressman Raul Ruiz, firefighters, teachers, police officers, and
the California Democratic Party in supporting my campaign.

MEMBER OF THE STATE ASSEMBLY,

56TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT

CHARLES BENNETT, Republican	AGE:	41

OCCUPATION:	Security/Public	Safety	Consultant

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

I am Charles Bennett Jr and I am running for the 56th assembly district
to serve you, the people, as I did for our country as a US Marine for
over 10 years.

I attended public schools until the 11th grade when I attended and
graduated from a military school. Upon graduating, I attended an
aviation college prior to enlisting in the Marine Corps where I worked
as a military police officer having worked in various aspects of law
enforcement.

Upon coming to Riverside County, I used the Gl bill to attend COD
where I studied business as well as classes in economics.

Currently, I have a small business where I consult on security and
public safety issues for public and private entities, and also serve as
a contributing expert to local broadcast media.

I entered the workforce at 13 delivering newspapers. I have had a
variety jobs; some I did not like but had to do in order to pay bills. I
know what it is like to be broke and live payday to payday.

I am running to serve the people, not politicians, special interests or
agenda’s. I know what it takes to create jobs, keep our communities
and schools safe and I will make veteran’s issues a priority.

I currently live in Indio with my wife and two small children.

I am asking for your vote to represent you in Sacramento.

very interested in hearing your concerns. Thank you.

degree possible, consistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of
collecting the transactions and use taxes, and at the same time, minimize the burden of record keeping upon persons subject to

or operation of this Ordinance.

3.	In those sections, including, but not necessarily limited to sections referring to the exterior boundaries of the State of
California, where the result of the substitution would be to:

subject to tax by the State under the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, or;

b.	Impose this tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property

4.26.100 PERMIT NOT REQUIRED. If a seller’s permit has been issued to a retailer under Section 6067 of the Revenue
and Taxation Code, an additional transactor’s permit shall not be required by this ordinance.

4.26.110 EXEMPTIONS AND EXCLUSIONS.

Section 2. Notice. The City Clerk is hereby directed to publish this ordinance at least once, within fifteen (15) days of its adoption, in
a newspaper of general circulation published and circulated in the City of Coachella.

RV 220-024

On July 23, 2014, the City Council placed Measure “U” on the
November 4,2014 ballot. If approved by a majority of Coachella voters,
this Measure would authorize a one percent (1.0%) retail transactions
and use (i.e. “sales”) tax within the City of Coachella. Measure “U” is
intended to prevent significant cuts to general City services resulting
from projected public safety cost increases by the County of Riverside
for fiscal year 2015/2016 that are estimated to increase 8% to 12% from
existing rates. This sales tax would be a “general tax,” meaning that
revenues raised from the tax would go into the City's general fund to
fund any lawful City program, improvement, or service. The City would
not be required to use the revenues raised by Measure “U” for any
special purpose or for any particular program or service.

California Revenue and Taxation Code section 7285.9 authorizes the
City to levy a transactions and use/sales tax at a rate of one percent
so long as the tax is approved by two-thirds of the City Council and a
majority of the voters voting in an election on that issue. If approved, the
sales tax would become effective on April 1,2015.

The tax would be paid in addition to current sales taxes and would be
collected at the same time and in the same manner as existing sales
taxes. All revenues raised by the tax would belong to the City and would
not be shared with the State or any other agency.

By placing Measure “U” on the ballot, the City complies with Article
XI11C of the California Constitution (Proposition 218), which requires
a majority of the voters to approve an ordinance which establishes a
general tax.

A “yes” vote on Measure “U” will authorize the sales tax.

A “no” vote on Measure “U” will not authorize the sales tax.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure “U”. If
you desire a copy of the Measure, please call Andrea Carranza,
the City’s elections official at (760) 398-3502 and a copy will be
mailed at no cost to you.
