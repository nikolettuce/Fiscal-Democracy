To preserve the educational quality of our schools in the face of Statewide budget cuts,
to maintain small class sizes, to enhance campus maintenance and student safety, and
to improve programs including but not limited to science, music, libraries, and athletics,
shall Pacific Grove Unified School District levy a tax of $35 per parcel for 5 years so long
as no money is used for administrative salaries, and a citizens oversight committee is
established?
