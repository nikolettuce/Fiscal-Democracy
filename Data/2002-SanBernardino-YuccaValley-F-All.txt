CANDIDATE FOR MEMBER OF THE STATE ASSEMBLY
65TH DISTRICT

NAME: RUSS BOGH, Republican
OCCUPATION: Member of the California Legislature

Local law enforcement agrees: Assemblyman Russ Bogh must be re-elected because public
safety is his number one priority.

Russ Bogh authored legislation providing grants to local law enforcement for “crime fighting”
technology - an important tool in the fight against terrorism.

The co-author of AB 1004, Russ Bogh wants to shorten the time period that requires a sex
offender to register with local police when re-locating to a new area.

As Vice Chairman of the Assembly Higher Education Committee, Russ Bogh co-sponsored
a bill increasing funding for our local community colleges...and he co-authored a measure
“equalizing” school funding that provides millions of extra dollars for our Inland Empire
schools.

As a businessman for his family’s company, Russ Bogh is working to help our economy by
pushing for statewide business tax credits that would create new jobs.

A fiscal conservative, Russ Bogh voted against the one-quarter cent sales tax hike - plus,
he wants to eliminate the “double sales tax” we pay at the gas pumps and he favors using
our gasoline taxes strictly for transportation projects.

Opposed to bailing out the utility companies, Russ Bogh fought against a plan to buy the
utilities’ transmission lines because that only leads to higher electric bills for taxpayers.
Born, raised and educated in the Inland Empire, Russ Bogh, his wife Sheri and their three
children live in Cherry Valley.

Yucca Valley needs leadership with vision, energy, and the ability to work toward
constructive, sensible solutions to the issues we face.

As a lifelong resident of Yucca Valley, I am passionate about the future direction of our
community and it’s position as the focal point of the Morongo Basin. Since we are uniquely
positioned as the gateway to the National Park, I believe we can leverage this position to

us here in the first place.

My top priorities are:

government. For six years I have made it my business to get involved in the details of how
our town operates. My familiarity of the issues that affect our town will be a strong asset as
a council member.

If you entrust me with a position on the Town Council I will do my level best to represent

failed economic theory, but a reality where money goes into real programs, services, and
infrastructure.

My commitment to protecting our environment is strong and I promise my commitment will
not fail even in the face of the most powerful special interests.

OCCUPATION: Teacher

I have lived and worked in Yucca Valley for twenty-nine years as an educator and in the
rental property business. I believe that by working together we can encourage our growth
through sound economic development that will provide job opportunities for skilled workers.
This effort will enhance our town’s image as a hometown community.

Yucca Valley has much to offer in the area of tourism by highlighting destinations
throughout the Morongo Basin and the Joshua Tree National Park.

The Town Council has placed a high priority on quality of life issues. We have brought
in over $8.7 million in grants that have directly improved the quality of life in our community.

I have worked hard to ensure that we use our law enforcement personnel efficiently,
continue to improve our roads, parks, and services to seniors.

A bright future will be secured for our community by being fiscally responsible, working
together and using common sense.

OCCUPATION: Incumbent

Thank you for allowing me to serve during the past four years as a Yucca Valley Town Council
member and mayor. I have provided honest, thoughtful leadership on issues facing our
community. I have brought integrity and fiscal responsibility, addressing many of the
problems of our seniors and youth recreational needs. As an executive member of the San
Bernardino Associated Governments I have been instrumental in securing over $8 million
in special grants for our community.

As a nineteen year resident of Yucca Valley that retired from the military as an infantry officer,
I have continued to serve my country and community as an active participant in local
government. With a Master’s degree in Public Administration and a Master’s degree in
Political Science, I have been able to have a second career as a college instructor at Copper
Mountain College, teaching history and political science.

Yucca Valley needs experience and proven leadership to face the challenges of the future.
I can provide that leadership and I can serve the community as a proactive representative,
who does not make worthless promises, but one who will be responsive to all the people
as their public servant.

MEASURE “F”

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY TOWN ATTORNEY*

Currently, the transient occupancy tax charged to each transient is seven percent (7%)
of the rent charged (hotel tax). This proposed Ordinance would increase the amount of the
transient occupancy tax from seven percent (7%) to nine percent (9%) of the rent charged.
In order for this Ordinance to be adopted by the people, it must receive a majority of those
persons voting on this matter.

THE PEOPLE OF THE TOWN OF YUCCA VALLEY, CALIFORNIA, DO HEREBY ORDAIN AS
FOLLOWS:

SECTION 1: Section 3.24.030 of Ordinance NO. 94 of the Town of Yucca Valley is hereby
amended to read as follows:

3.24.030 Tax imposed. For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient
is subject to, and shall pay a tax in the amount of (9%) nine percent of the rent charged
by the operator or otherwise payable by the transient. Insofar as the transient is
concerned, said tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the operator or to the
Town. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid
with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient’s ceasing to
occupy space in the hotel. If the tax is not paid to the hotel operator, the Tax
Administrator may require payment directly to him.

SECTION 2: Modification by Town Council. Notwithstanding this Ordinance’s adoption by
the People, the Town Council shall be free to amend any provision hereof through the regular
process of adoption of ordinances under state law, provided that the amendment is
consistent with the intent hereof, furthers the purpose of this Chapter, and except that the
tax rate may only be increased by the People.

SECTION 3: Severability. If any phrase, clause, sentence, subsection or section of this
Ordinance is for any reason held to be invalid, such invalidity shall not affect the validity of
any other part of this Ordinance. The people hereby declare that they would have passed
this Ordinance or each phrase, clause, sentence, subsection or section hereof irrespective
of the fact that any one or more of such phrases, clauses, sentences, subsections or sections
have been declared invalid. Any court reviewing the validity of this Ordinance shall interpret
it insofar as possible, as to make it valid and binding, and to carry out the intent of the voters
to create a fund to pay for the foregoing activities to the full extend permitted by law.
