The Top Two Candidates Open Primary Act requires that all candidates for a voter-nominated office be listed on the same ballot.
Previously known as partisan offices, voter-nominated offices are state legislative offices, U.S. congressional offices, and state
constitutional offices.

In both the open primary and general elections, you can vote for any candidate regardless of what party preference you indicated
on your voter registration form. In the primary election, the two candidates receiving the most votes—regardless of party
preference—move on to the general election. If a candidate receives a majority of the vote (50 percent + 1), a general election
still must be held.

California’s open primary system does not apply to candidates running for local offices.

Voter-Nominated Offices

Political parties are not entitled to formally nominate candidates for voter-nominated offices at the primary election. A
candidate nominated for a voter-nominated office at the primary election is the nominee of the people and not the official nominee
of any party at the general election. A candidate for nomination to a voter-nominated office shall have his or her party preference,
or lack of party preference, stated on the ballot, but the party preference designation is selected solely by the candidate and is
shown for the information of the voters only. It does not mean the candidate is nominated or endorsed by the party designated,
or that there is an affiliation between the party and candidate, and no candidate nominated by the voters shall be deemed to be
the officially nominated candidate of any political party. In the county sample ballot booklet, parties may list the candidates for
voter-nominated offices who have received the party’s official endorsement.

Any voter may vote for any candidate for a voter-nominated office, if they meet the other qualifications required to vote
for that office. The top two vote-getters at the primary election move on to the general election for the voter-nominated office even
if both candidates have specified the same party preference designation. No party is entitled to have a candidate with its party
preference designation move on to the general election, unless the candidate is one of the two highest vote-getters at the primary
election.

Nonpartisan State Offices

Political parties are not entitled to nominate candidates for nonpartisan offices at the primary election, and a candidate
at the primary election is not the official nominee of any party for the specific office at the general election. A candidate for
nomination to a nonpartisan office may not designate his or her party preference, or lack of party preference, on the ballot. The
top two vote-getters at the primary election move on to the general election for the nonpartisan office.

New electoral district boundaries are drawn every 10 years in order to equalize district populations. Boundaries for the
congressional, state legislative, and county supervisorial districts are now different. Boundary changes also apply to any city,
school district, or special district that votes by trustee areas or divisions. To see the new district maps, visit the Registrar of
Voters website at www.voteinfo.net.

CANDIDATE STATEMENT FOR
UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE,

36TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT

RAUL RUIZ, Democratic

OCCUPATION:	Congressman / Emergency Physician

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

Washington is broken. There’s too much partisan bickering and too
many career politicians who only care about their own interests.

I am not a career politician, and never will be. I'm an emergency physician
who ran for office to serve people in our communities, just like I have
for my entire adult life.

As a doctor, I'm trained to focus on what matters and to put people first:

I STOOD UP AGAINST EFFORTS TO CUT SOCIAL SECURITY AND
MEDICARE: I promised that I will never vote to cut Medicare benefits,
and I've kept my promise. And I've held workshops and town halls
throughout the area to help prevent fraud against seniors.

I STOOD UP FOR VETERANS: I introduced legislation to speed up
claims for veterans’ benefits, make it easier for veterans to find jobs,
and improve the quality of life for disabled veterans. And my office
helped deliver over $1 million in delayed benefits to local veterans.

I FOUGHT TO END GRIDLOCK: I voted for fiscal responsibility and
a bipartisan budget to protect the economy and prevent another
government shutdown.

I FOUGHT TO MAKE SURE FAMILIES HAVE ACCESS TO
AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. As a physician, I understand the
importance of health care. That’s why I voted to prevent insurance
companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing
conditions, and to help people keep their existing policies under the
new health care law.

We can’t afford more partisan gridlock in Washington. That’s why I
would be honored to have your support.

CANDIDATE STATEMENT FOR
UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE,

36TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT

RAY HAYNES, Republican	AGE:	59

OCCUPATION:	Small	Businessman

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

For fourteen years, I represented Riverside County in the State
Legislature as a member of the State Assembly and the Senate. I
served as the Republican Whip in the Senate, the Assistant Republican
Leader in the Assembly, as Chair of the Senate Constitutional
Amendments Committee, and Vice Chair of the Senate Health and
Human Services Committee. In the year 2000,1 was elected National
Chair of the American Legislative Exchange Council, a national
organization of State Legislators that prepares model legislation from a
free market, less tax, smaller government perspective. As the Senate
Republican Whip, I analyzed legislation for over 4000 bills per year,
and was re-elected to that position 3 times by my Senate Republican
colleagues.

During my service, I received the Legislator of the Year award from
the California Rifle and Pistol Association. I helped pass the “Three
Strikes and You're Out” legislation, which within a year after its passage
helped reduce California’s crime rate by nearly 50%, and I introduced,
and ultimately co-authored the legislation that cut California’ car tax by
67%, which saved the taxpayers of California over $50 billion in the 10
years after its passage.

I will continue to fight in Washington DC for an agenda of small
government and less taxes, just as I did in Sacramento. My Republican
colleagues elected me to leadership because they trusted that my
recommendations on legislation would lead to less taxes and smaller
government. You will be able to trust me as well.

CANDIDATE STATEMENT FOR
UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE,

36TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT

BRIAN NESTANDE, Republican
OCCUPATION:	State	Representative

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

I am running for Congress to help reignite the American Dream and
move our country in the direction of growth and prosperity.

My wife Gina and I have a family and we are working hard to provide
a better future for our children. But Washington is making it harder for
middle class families to get ahead.

Every year Congress keeps spending more money. Our national debt
is now over $17 trillion. And this debt will be handed down to future
generations.

That’s why I’ll sponsor a Balanced Budget Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution - to stop the reckless spending.

I will vote to replace Obamacare with needed healthcare reform
that costs less, and allows patients and doctors to make healthcare
decisions, not Washington bureaucrats.

Let’s focus on protecting and enhancing what Americans really want:

•	Policies that encourage businesses to expand and promote
so we have high quality, full time, good paving jobs.

•	Secure funding for Medicare and Social Security.

•	A strong national defense that keeps us safe, and doesn’t
interfere with individual liberties.

•	To provide teachers and parents with the necessary
resources and tools. Our children deserve the best education
in the world.

I am committed to moving America in the right direction.

I would be honored to have your vote.

STATE SENATOR,

28TH SENATORIAL DISTRICT

GLENN A. MILLER, Republican	AGE: 50

OCCUPATION:	City Councilmember / Businessman

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

As your State Senator I will bring back local control from Sacramento
and its special interests. I am not a Sacramento insider or a career
politician, but an independent leader working for you to get the
resources needed to solve issues at the local level. That is what I have
done as a Councilmember for over 6 years.

My first priority is to create more jobs and work to improve our economy.
As a small business owner, I believe in cutting government “red tape”,
reducing business fees and lessening the burden of over regulation that
impacts both employers and employees.

I will protect Proposition 13 from efforts in Sacramento to change it to
create a $6 billion tax increase and will work to improve our schools by
moving resources back to teachers in the class room.

My endorsements include Mayors and Councilmembers from:
Murrieta, Palm Desert, Palm Springs, Lake Elsinore, Indio, Rancho
Mirage, La Quinta, Cathedral City, Indian Wells, Wildomar, Blythe,
Desert Hot Springs and California Highway Patrolmen, Palm Springs
Police Officers Association, Indio Police Officers Association, CDF
Firefighters and Cathedral City Fire Management Association.

I’m a common sense, fiscally responsible, endorsed local leader that
gets things done. Please vote Glenn Miller.

Thank You.

ANNA NEVENIC, Democratic
OCCUPATION:	Registered	Nurse	/	Author

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

I’m a nurse, educator and a community activist. I value honesty, integrity
and compassion. I believe that

California’s best days are ahead of us if we change the status quo and
public policies that have failed us. As your senator I will stand up to
wealthy special interest and fight for the bold solutions that are going
to bring positive change to our state. Tax cuts for the reach have
bankrupted America. The middle class pays: more for education,
healthcare, broken schools, closed parks and courts. Talented students
cannot afford tuition, threatening our future. I’m solution oriented and I
pledge to protect my special interest; children, seniors and families in
my district. I have detailed plans for creation of well-paid jobs, cleaning
up our environment, and providing job training for displaced workers
and students. Creation of sustainable, well-paying jobs is possible.
Offer tax incentives to foster innovation, and attract investments in
local industry. There is no better place for clean-tech industries than
in our district. We must provide first-rate education and tools to drive
our economy forward. Support policies that empower teachers, not
politicians and bureaucrats. I believe in equal rights and in women
right to choose. We must educate our youth; prevent crime, drug use,
poverty and teen pregnancy. My campaign is people driven. Stand up
with me! Together we will bring change that we need. Please share our
fight with your friends.

CANDIDATE STATEMENT FOR
STATE SENATOR,

28TH SENATORIAL DISTRICT

BONNIE GARCIA, Republican
OCCUPATION:	Small	Business	Woman

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

California is broken - Taxes are high, criminals are being released early,
property owners are losing their rights and our court system continues
to allow environmental extremists to stop development that push jobs
out of state.

During my six years as your Assemblywoman, I didn’t support a single
tax increase or reckless spending and voted to adopt a rainy day fund.
My stance earned me the support of every Republican State Senator
and Four Riverside County Supervisors.

I'm from a law enforcement and Military family, value freedom and
understand personal sacrifices. The Gun Owners of California
endorsed me because I fought to protect your 2nd Amendment rights
and will never jeopardize your right to protect your family.

I’m a strong advocate of Public Safety and opposed the Governor’s
plan to allow hardened criminals to leave prison early. That's why I
earned the support of The California Police Chiefs' Association and
Crime Victims United.

The California Small Business Association support me because I
created thousands of jobs, expanded opportunities for veterans and
secured funding for small businesses. I understand a strong workforce
is more important than senseless regulations.

With your support I will continue to use my experience and degree in
Workforce Development and Education to promote a broad array of
conservative priorities - sound fiscal policies, quality schools, safer
communities and protecting the value of every life.

Experience and ethics matter.

I would be honored to have your vote.

JEFF STONE, Republican	AGE:	58

OCCUPATION:	Riverside County Supervisor / Small Business

Owner

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

As a Riverside County Supervisor and longtime small business
owner, I’m proud to be running for the Senate with the support of local
taxpayers, seniors and small business owners.

I’m also honored to be the choice of Law Enforcement leaders, including
Riverside County Sheriff Stan Sniff. District Attorney Paul Zellerbach
and the Riverside Sheriffs Association.

Over 3,200 law enforcement officers and investigators in Riverside
County endorse me because they know I will OPPOSE EARLY
RELEASE of dangerous prisoners and work to keep our neighborhoods,
schools and homes safe.

I signed the NO NEW TAXES pledge because taxpayers already pay
too much for a broken, dysfunctional state government. As a local
official, I successfully lowered taxes without cutting vital services. I’ll
work to do the same in Sacramento.

My priorities are: JOB CREATION and Improving the Business
Climate; No New Taxes, Balance the Budget, Stop Early Release of
Prison Inmates. I support the 2nd Amendment and believe in limited
government.

I’m supported by Riverside County Supervisor Kevin Jeffries, who said:
“Jeff Stone is a true citizen-politician who will bring strong conservative
values to the State Senate.”

Special interests in Sacramento are spending massive sums of money
to influence your vote. Ask yourself: do you want a Senator who will
be a voice for the special interests; or one who will be a voice for you?

I’d be honored to receive your vote and represent you in the State
Senate. Please visit www.JeffStone2014.com to read more. Thank you.

CANDIDATE STATEMENT FOR
MEMBER OF THE STATE ASSEMBLY,

56TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT

EDUARDO GARCIA, Democratic
OCCUPATION:	Mayor,	City	of Coachella

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

As a lifelong resident of the Coachella Valley, a father, and a public
servant, I want what is best for our families, residents, and local
businesses.

I’m running for State Assembly to fight for the issues that matter most
to our residents: strengthening our economy, improving neighborhood
schools, and building healthier, safer communities.

As a four-term Mayor of Coachella and policy director for State
Senator Ben Hueso, I have a track record of building coalitions that
get results, and working with elected leaders from both parties to find
positive solutions.

As Mayor, I worked with business and labor to spearhead local jobs
initiatives. Under my watch, Coachella invested over $100 million in
public works projects — infrastructure and transportation, parks &
recreation, and a revitalized downtown. As a result, our city is a better
place to live, work, and raise a family. During the recession, when
other cities around the state made drastic cuts and slashed services,
our residents and tax dollars were protected because of the fiscal
safeguards I helped establish.

I’ve built partnerships between the city and community-based
nonprofits to expand access to health care throughout the Coachella
Valley — this work was recognized by President Bill Clinton last year.

I have the experience and expertise to be a strong advocate for
the Coachella Valley in the Legislature. Please join Congressman
Raul Ruiz, Assemblymember Manuel Perez, as well as firefighters,
police, nurses, and the California Democratic Party in supporting my
campaign.

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

I am Charles Bennett Jr and I am running for the 56th assembly district
to serve you, the people, as I did for our country as a US Marine for
over 10 years.

I attended public schools until the 11th grade when I attended and
graduated from a military school. Upon graduating, I attended an
aviation college prior to enlisting in the Marine Corps where I worked
as a military police officer having worked in various aspects of law
enforcement.

Upon coming to Riverside County, I used the Gl bill to attend COD
where I studied business as well as classes in economics.

Currently, I have a small business where I consult on security and
public safety issues for public and private entities as well as contribute
to these issues on local news channels.

I entered the workforce at 13 delivering newspapers. I have had a
variety jobs; some I did not like but had to do in order to pay bills. I
know what it is like to be broke and live payday to payday.

I am running to serve the people, not politicians, special interests or
agenda’s. I know what it takes to create job, keep our communities
and schools safe and I will make veteran’s issues a priority.

LEONARD J. CRAVENS	AGE: 55

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

My name is Leonard Cravens. I am running for Superior Court Judge,
Seat 3, Riverside County. I have college degrees in Computer Science
and Information Systems, as well as my Law Degree. I worked many
years as a computer programmer & systems analyst. Because of that
work, I am uniquely qualified to implement changes in procedures at
the court that respect YOU and your TIME.

Customer Service at Riverside Superior Court needs to respect YOU
and your TIME. Cases (including detailed results of hearings) such
as Criminal, Traffic, and Civil should be available to be viewed on the
court’s website without paying a fee. Papers should be able to be filed
at any courthouse, not just the courthouse where the case was filed.
You should be able to “Walk In” to any courthouse to see a judicial
officer about your traffic or misdemeanor warrant case that same
day! I propose that if you arrive at any courthouse by 3:00PM, you are
guaranteed to see a judicial officer that same day to resolve your traffic
ticket or misdemeanor warrant.

MARK A. COPE	AGE: 55

OCCUPATION:	Superior Court Judge

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

I’ve been honored to serve the people of Riverside County as a judge
since 1995. Riverside County deserves a judge with experience,
integrity, and a commitment to justice.

EXPERIENCE. Since leaving a career as a prosecutor over two
decades ago, I have presided over thousands of hearings in cases of
all types - criminal, family, civil, traffic, small claims, juvenile and others.
My experience even includes teaching other judges.

INTEGRITY. Judges are not elected to make law. My record shows my
firm commitment to the rule that a judge cannot allow outside influences
to affect decisions, nor let personal views overrule the will of the people.

COMMITTED TO JUSTICE. As Presiding Judge, I’ve worked hard to
ensure access to justice for all. Riverside County has not had its fair
share of judges and funding for court services. Together with others,
I have fought for change, and we are winning. Riverside County now
more fairly receives resources to open doors to courthouses that have
been closed, and let people who need services have their day in court.

Please join every current Riverside County judge, numerous Presiding
Judges from other courts, retired judges, law enforcement officials, and
your friends and neighbors. Vote to re-elect Judge Mark Cope.

OCCUPATION:	Riverside County Supervisor, 4th District /

Retired Highway Patrol Commander
EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

I have served our community as highway patrol commander, school
board member, legislator and county supervisor.

I am now putting that experience to work, leading efforts to grow our
economy, protect neighborhoods from crime, and expand access to
health care.

I brought the Coachella Valley nearly a half-billion dollars in upcoming
public safety and infrastructure investments which will make us safer,
create hundreds of construction jobs and generate 400 new, permanent
positions.

By promoting tourism, fast-tracking permits and providing tax credits to
job creating employers, I helped add even more jobs.

I ensured that all $50 million from the Sentinel Power Plant was returned
to the valley, further benefiting our local economy.

Health care access will improve locally as a result of the new medical
school, physician training programs and new medical clinics which I
helped bring to the valley.

My 31 years in law enforcement taught me how to keep people safe.
That’s why I helped enact a law to protect students from sex offenders,
took action to stop the early release of dangerous prisoners and
supported construction of two new sheriff’s stations.

MEASURE “F” - CITY OF DESERT HOT SPRINGS

ATTACHMENT A

ORDINANCE NO.______

AN ORDINANCE OF THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY OF DESERT HOT
SPRINGS, CALIFORNIA, AMENDING CHAPTER 3.32 “PUBLIC
SAFETY SPECIAL TAX” OF THE CITY OF DESERT HOT SPRINGS
MUNICIPAL CODE TO REPLACE THE SPECIAL TAX RATES ONLY
FOR ALL CATEGORIES OF VACANT PARCELS SET FORTH IN
ATTACHMENT 1 OF ORDINANCE NO. 517 WITH A FLAT EXCISE TAX
RATE OF $372.68 PER ACRE, WITH NO TAX RATE INCREASE FOR
ANY OTHER CATEGORY OF PROPERTY OWNER

WHEREAS, the City Council of the City of Desert Hot Springs (“City Council”) declared a Fiscal Emergency on November 19, 2013, due
to a funding crisis which is the result of factors largely outside the City’s control, including national/state economic trends, rapid cost increases,
declining revenue and unpredictable State takeaways of local revenue; and

WHEREAS, the State of California has taken millions of dollars from the City of Desert Hot Springs (“City”) over the past decade, most
recently by eliminating $1.5 Million per year in redevelopment funding; and

WHEREAS, in response to the Fiscal Emergency, the City has slashed its budget by implementing pension reform, reducing employee
benefits and holidays, cutting its City Hall staff by 66%, reducing employee salaries by 22% across the board, and eliminating all non-essential
spending; and

WHEREAS, the City had no choice but to use its urgent reserve funds to maintain public safety and other essential community services
and those funds have now been exhausted; and

WHEREAS, the population of the City Desert Hot Springs (the “City”) has grown by 7.3 percent since the year 2010; and

WHEREAS, the City’s Police and Fire Departments have not kept pace with the rate of the City’s population increase; and

WHEREAS, property crimes, crimes against persons, drug trafficking and criminal street gang activity continue to be serious problems in

the City;

WHEREAS, one of the City’s two Fire Stations are amongst the busiest in Riverside County and the City’s Police Department is so busy
responding to calls for assistance that they have virtually no time to patrol or conduct community policing; and

WHEREAS, additional funding is needed to address the City’s Fiscal Emergency, stabilize its budget, build its reserves and maintain its
local City of Desert Hot Springs Police Department; and

WHEREAS, the revenue produced by the Measure’s proposed tax will be used to fund “Public Safety Services,” which includes: (a) police
protection, such as but not limited to, improving 911 emergency response times, maintaining a safe level of police officer staffing, implementing
gang/drug prevention programs, engaging in more active community policing,

WHEREAS, the City has determined that the size of a vacant parcel has a direct relationship to the usage of public safety services, with
larger vacant parcels providing more opportunity for the occurrence and proliferation of the public nuisance activities described above; and

WHEREAS, the Measure’s tax rate is not tailored to individual use both because such tailoring is not administratively feasible and
because the City must make public safety services available to all parcels equally; and

WHEREAS, the Measure’s tax rate represents the cost in today’s dollars of the availability and the privilege of using and use of public
safety services; and

WHEREAS, since the cost of the availability and the privilege of using and the use of public safety services will vary based on market
conditions and inflation rates, it is imperative that in order capture the changes in the cost of providing the public safety services in relation to vacant
parcels in the City the Measure’s tax rate will continue to be adjusted annually for inflation as currently set forth in Section 35.162 of the Municipal
Code; and

WHEREAS, the California Constitution does not prohibit a tax on the mere ownership of real property if the tax is a special tax and not
an ad valorem tax; and

WHEREAS, the Measure’s tax is not ad valorem tax nor is it a transaction or sales tax on the sale of real property; and

WHEREAS, at least a two-thirds vote of the electors of the City at an election held on June 3,2014, called for such a purpose in a manner
consistent with California Constitution Article XIIID, Section 3, California Government Code Sections 53722 et seq., approved the Measure; and

WHEREAS, Section 53722 of the California Government Code provides that a local government may not impose any special tax unless
and until such special tax is submitted to the electorate of the local government, and approved by a two-thirds vote of the voters voting in an election
on the issue; and

WHEREAS, under California Constitution Article XIII D, Section 3, Subdivision (a), a special tax receiving a two-thirds vote may be
imposed upon any parcel of property or upon any person as an incident of property ownership; and

RV 032-024

WHEREAS, under California Constitution Article XIII A, Section 4, a non-ad valorem tax may be imposed upon real property if the tax is
a “special” tax dedicated to specific purposes and approved by a two-thirds vote of the qualified electors of the city imposing the tax; and

WHEREAS, a tax is special whenever expenditure of its revenues is limited to specific purposes which is true even though there may be
multiple specific purposes for which revenues may be spent; and

WHEREAS, the California Elections Code Section 321 defines “elector” to mean any person who is a United States citizen 18 years of
age or older and a resident of an election precinct at least 15 days prior to an election; and

WHEREAS, states may require voters to be bona fide residents of the relevant political subdivision and strict scrutiny of the fundamental
interest in the right to vote is not used by the courts to create a right to vote in nonresidents who are not otherwise qualified; and

WHEREAS, under the rational basis standard of review, the equal protection clause does not require that nonresident landowners be
given the right to vote on the taxing measure because California law governing the qualification of voters requires the relevant electorate for a
municipal election regarding a flat-rate vacant parcel tax to be registered voters of the City which in this particular election means residents have
the sole constitutional right to vote in this municipal election, whereas nonresident landowners had no such right; and

WHEREAS, the Measure’s flat-rate vacant parcel tax (1) was assessed on the mere ownership of real property, (2) was not an ad valorem
tax, and (3) was a valid special tax because it was approved by two-thirds of the relevant electorate and its revenues were dedicated to specific
governmental purposes; and

WHEREAS, based on all the information presented at the March 4, 2014, meeting of the City Council, both written and oral, including the
staff reports, minutes, and other relevant materials, the City Council finds that under CEQA Guidelines 15060(c)(2) and 15378, subdivisions (2) and
(4) of subdivision (b), this tax does not constitute a project under CEQA and therefore review under CEQA is not required; and

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE “F”

Measure “F” will be a levy on vacant parcels only to help fund public
safety services for the entire City. There will be no increase in the tax
rate to homeowners or business owners who don’t own vacant parcels
or to any other owners of developed property.

Preceding the City Council’s decision to place Measure “F” on the ballot,
it declared a Fiscal Emergency and implemented pension reform,
reduced employee benefits and holidays, cut City Hall staff by 66%,
reduced most employee salaries by 22%, reduced and eliminated some
consulting contracts, and cut some non-essential spending.

Measure “F”, if approved, will impose a flat tax rate of $372.68 per acre
on any vacant parcel in the City. Vacant parcel will mean any parcel
that does not contain any habitable structures with required plumbing,
electricity and other improvements with validly issued permits within the
parcel’s boundaries. If Measure "F” is not approved, the current Fiscal
Year 2013-14 rates per acre will remain in place as follows: Vacant
R-L Residential Low ($9.22 x 3); Vacant R-M Residential Medium
($9.22 x 5); Vacant R-MH Residential Mobile Home ($9.22 x 6); Vacant
R-H Residential High ($9.22 x 8); Vacant Industrial ($2.54); Vacant
Hotel ($10.55); and Vacant Commercial ($125.45), subject to annual
adjustments due to increases in the cost of living.

The revenue produced by Measure “F" may only be used for public
safety services which include animal control, code enforcement, fire
protection and police protection services.

Police protection services include protecting the safety of citizens,
enforcing criminal, vehicular laws and City ordinances; enhancing the
quality of life for citizens; responding to calls for police assistance;
cooperating with other City departments, law enforcement agencies
and social service agencies.

Fire protection services include fire protection, fire prevention, rescue
and medical aid services provided by the Riverside County Fire
Department.

Animal control services include maintaining a safe and stray-free
community, enforcing applicable state and City animal regulations;
regulating kennel operation and maintenance; caring for impounded
animals; providing pet adoption services; picking up stray animals;
issuing and recording dog licenses; investigating animal abuse;
handling endangered species; and removing wild animals and reptiles
from the community.

Code enforcement services include enforcement of all city regulations
regarding public nuisances, business licensing and abandoned
vehicles.

Other than cost of living increases, the City Council is prohibited from
increasing the rate or amount of the vacant parcel tax above the rate or
amount set forth in Measured” unless such an increase is first approved
by at least a two-thirds vote of the electors of the City at an election
called for such a purpose.

Parcels owned by the City, the federal government, the state, or any
other local public agency and parcels owned by any other public or
private entity that is specifically exempted from local property-related
taxation shall be exempt from the provisions of Measure “F”.

The provisions of Measure “F” will expire June 30, 2020.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE “F”

Close unfair tax loopholes for owners of vacant land and prevent the
elimination of our Desert Hot Springs Police Department—Vote YES
on "F"!

YES on “F” addresses our City’s Fiscal Emergency-preventing
bankruptcy, deeper cuts to city services, and the deterioration of our
home property values.

YES on “F” maintains our Police, Fire, and 9-1-1 Emergency Services,
keeping our families safe.

Measure “F” is NOT a new tax.

Measure “F” is NOT a tax increase for homeowners.

By voting YES on “F”, existing voter-approved funding is simply updated
to close an unfair tax loophole for owners of vacant land that are not
paying their fair share.

Measure “F” is NOT a tax increase on Desert Hot Springs homeowners,
and it does NOT apply to anyone but those who own vacant parcels.
There is NO tax increase for anyone else.

Over the last several years, the City has reduced City Hall staffing by
66%, cut employee salaries by as much as one-third, implemented
pension reform, and eliminated all other non-essential funding. Our
City has made every cut possible and we need Measure “F” to maintain
Police, Fire, and 9-1-1 service levels and prevent more severe,
permanent service cuts.

YES on “F" includes fiscal accountability provisions. Residents will have
access to public expenditure reports, and annual independent audits to
ensure City officials use voter-approved tax dollars as promised.

YES on "F" prevents bankruptcy! We must continue to be our own
independent City—otherwise, bankruptcy judges or the County could
impose hundreds of dollars in new fees for services, and Desert Hot
Springs residents would have no say in what they pay.

VoteYESon “F”to maintain Desert Hot Spring’s Local Police Department
and protect our Future. For official information about Measure “F”, visit
www.citvofdhs.ora.

Remember -whatever you do, vote YES on “F” on June 3rd!

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE “F”

Don’t “F” us! - Devastating to Desert Hot Springs...

Crushing 1,247% tax increase on property -14,572% on industrial.

A game of chicken? Raising the stakes, refusing to reform. No enormous
tax increase and they will bankrupt the city (requiring reforms anyway).
They get this tax increase, no reforms. Pretty well thought out and
precisely timed for something suddenly thrust upon them.

Synically short changing the kids (needing $8,000) to advantageously
change perceptions. Remember the absurdity of our swim team forced
to practice in a parking lot. Twisted priorities and gross mismanagement
is our problem.

We had millions for facades and other goodies. More than $36 Million
in redevelopment bonds alone... like magic, all gone with interest. This
dramatic sleight of hand distracts from asking where it went.

Realistic balance is needed. The stakeholders need to propose
solutions.

Bentley's Transparency Reforms (Why can’t we do this?)

1)	Require the current and proposed budgets be online

2)	Require expense account expenditures online

3)	Require city contracts online

"Impartial Analysis” is written by the City Attorney.

My Analysis

Purpose: Increase taxes and punish owners of open space.

Wrecks well considered plans of individuals. More taxes will kill
development prospects. Value of the properties will simply drop to
balance the cost of new taxes, devastating all property values. This
is obvious, like gravity. The basis upon which the taxes are levied is
reduced. Bringing in less revenue than predicted. Added taxes may
cause more unfinished projects.

ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE “F”

First understand. Some delight in cruelty. When we fight, they applaud.
When we fail, they rejoice. Be reasonable, be dignified, and we win.
Don’t blame the person in the same boat with you, or the person lying
in the gutter.

I can’t tell you what decision is right for you in your heart. You have to
make your own decisions. I can only give you the facts.

You’ve been lied to again and again. Before the City Council election
there was no talk of problems. Everyone claims they didn’t know of any
deficit. Is this “innocent” dishonesty or just gross negligence? Neither,
it is a trick.

When I hear the first few notes of a song I know it’s playing again...

We just did this. The song is the same-
New City Manager is hired.

After “further review” he suddenly finds a previously unknown deficit.
More taxes are urgently required.

The deficit is not in Public Safety. (Currently 68% of our budget.)
Unsustainable imbalance; it’s a deficit in everything else.

But by threatening Public Safety the City Council can get you to raise
your own taxes with no reforms whatsoever.

City Council and previous City Manager have thrown the problem they
created in your laps offering only one solution... more taxes with no
accountability. And they will use it, as they just did, in their election
campaigns, claiming they “saved the DHS Police”. Shocking! Make no
mistake threatening our Public Safety is not saving it. If you vote to
raise our taxes, please understand you are letting them off the hook
completely. No explanation why they did this.

Remember, I was the only one who told you the truth.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE “F”

Don’t be fooled by a fiction writer’s political rhetoric. Consider the facts
and vote YES on “F”:

FACT: The City of Desert Hot Springs declared a Fiscal Emergency
based on the independent review and findings of an outside auditor.
Our fiscal challenges have been national news, obvious to everyone
but the sole person opposing Measure “F”.

FACT: Our City is in danger of going into bankruptcy again. We must take
action to prevent this from happening and protect our local taxpayers
and residents.

FACT: Measure “F” is NOT a new tax.

FACT: Measure “F" is NOT a tax increase for anyone except owners of
vacant parcels. Unless you own vacant land, you won’t have to pay a
penny more, and neither will other homeowners or residents.

FACT: Again, Measure “F” ONLY affects owners of vacant parcels-most
are out of town landowners who don’t even live here. These absentee
landowners are receiving the same police and fire services you use for
their properties, while paying only a fraction of the taxes the rest of us
do! That’s simply not fair.

YES on “F” closes unfair tax loopholes so everyone pays their Fair
Share.

YES on “F” maintains our Police, Fire and 9-1-1 Emergency Services
and prevents deeper cuts to these Safety Services.

YES on “F” prevents our City’s bankruptcy and stabilizes our City’s
fiscal situation.

Measure “F” requires a 2/3’s vote-Remember, Vote YES on “F” for tax
