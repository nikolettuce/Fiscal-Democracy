REBUTTAL TO THE ARGUMENT AGAINST PROPOSITION B

Remove the Bars. Vote Yes on B.

The Split Pavilion is on Public property. If you don’t like it Vote Yes on B and have it removed, this
is your only chance to give the citizens of Carlsbad control of this valuable piece of Public property.

Many people want this to be an issue about art. For these people I ask, “Why should an artist have
more rights than the people who pay for maintenance, pay for insurance, own the property and
hold all responsibility for liability”?

How many times have you looked around Carlsbad and wished you could have made a
difference? This time you can, VOTE YES ON “B”.

Section 4. Use of Revenue. Revenue raised by the special tax may be used solely for the
purpose of paying for local expenses of the System and to reimburse all reasonable costs incurred
in connection with the election.

Section 5. Approval by Voters. The special tax proposed by this ordinance shall be
submitted to the voters within the boundaries of Zone A - Carlsbad of County Service Area 135-
Regional 800 MHZ Radio System. The ballot proposition shall be worded as provided in the

the maintenance and operation of the System.

or otherwise unenforceable, the other provisions of this ordinance shall remain in full force and
effect.

COUNTY COUNSEL’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

For the purpose of funding the City of Carlsbad's costs of participating in a Police, Fire and
Public Safety Regional Communications System ("System"), you are asked to vote on the
adoption of a special tax ordinance ("Ordinance”) to apply within the boundaries of County Service
Area 135-Zone A, Carlsbad. County Service Area 135 as a whole consists of the unincorporated
area plus the cities of Carlsbad, Del Mar, Encinitas, Solana Beach, San Marcos, Vista, Imperial
Beach, Santee, Lemon Grove and Poway. A two-thirds “yes” vote is required to approve the
Ordinance.

Pursuant to the Regional Communications System Agreement the City of Carlsbad and the
other participating jurisdictions are required to fund certain costs (“local costs") of the System.
Zone A, Carlsbad, of CSA 135 was established to fund these local costs. The special tax provided
by the Ordinance will replace and not increase a county service area zone charge levied within the
City of Carlsbad in 1995-1997 and which, due to the provisions of Proposition 218, may no longer
be imposed.

Each year, the special tax will be limited to the amount actually needed (but not more than the
maximum amount permitted by the Ordinance) to pay for Carlsbad’s costs of participating in the
System. As specified in the Ordinance, revenue raised by the tax may be used solely to pay
(1) local expenses of the System and (2) the reasonable costs of this election.

The maximum annual special tax under this Ordinance is $2.42 a benefit unit. Each tax parcel
is assessed a specified number of benefit units based on the use of the property. For example,
single family homes are assessed 7 benefit units, mobilehomes are assessed 4 benefit units,
developed industrial parcels are assessed 20 benefit units and timeshares are assessed one-half
a benefit unit.

The maximum annual tax to be levied by Zone A, Carlsbad on a single family home will be
$16.94 and on a mobilehome will be $9.68.

The Ordinance provides that after capital costs of the System are paid for, it is the intent of the
Board of Supervisors to reduce the tax to the amount necessary to pay for ongoing operations and
maintenance costs.

A separate and distinct proposition (Proposition C) will also appear on your ballot requesting
voter approval from all residents of County Service Area 135 of a separate special tax ordinance
to pay countywide (backbone) costs of the System. If Proposition C passes, the City of Carlsbad
will not be required to pay its share of these backbone costs from local revenues; however,
revenue raised by the Ordinance will then be used to pay other local expenses such as user
equipment. If Proposition C does not pass and this proposition passes, the City of Carlsbad may
use the revenue raised by this Ordinance to pay its share of the backbone plus other local
expenses.

A “yes” vote means that you are in favor of adopting the Ordinance.

A “no” vote means that you are opposed to adopting the Ordinance.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION E

VOTE YES on Propositions C and E to complete the emergency 800 MHz Regional
Communications System.

Public Safety First

Time and time again, California has learned one overriding lesson from its fire and earthquake
disasters - communication and regional coordination of resources are absolutely essential.
When your family or property is threatened by a fast-moving wildfire or other peril, you know that
seconds count. Firefighters and law enforcement officers know that too. That’s why they are asking
you to vote "YES” on Propositions C and E.

Propositions C and E will:

•	Cut emergency response times

•	Enhance disaster preparedness

•	Provide Improved public safety

by establishing a regional communications system linking public safety personnel.

Proposition C funds the “backbone”, such as transmission towers, that creates the system.
Proposition E provides the radio equipment, which allows Carlsbad to use the system.

Saving Lives, Saving Property

Today, when several agencies respond to a public safety crisis they cannot all communicate with
each other. During the “1996 Harmony Grove Fire”, precious time was lost because police
officers and firefighters were forced to try to communicate through a patchwork of different radio
frequencies. A “YES" vote on Propositions C and E will change that. Propositions C and E
were written by public safety professionals; they know firsthand of San Diego County's vital
need for a reliable communications system.

Enhance your family’s safety for six cents a dav.

Collection of property taxes to pay for the communication system was actually started in 1995/96,
and collected until 1996/97, when Proposition 218 halted the collection of funding pending voter
approval. The maximum combined cost for Propositions C and E for a Carlsbad homeowner will
be $22.62 per year - the same as It was In 1996/97.

Please support public safety - vote “YES” on Propositions C and E.
