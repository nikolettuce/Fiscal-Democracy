ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE L

CITY OF KING
IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY OF
INITIATIVE TO REPEAL UTILITY USERS' TAX ORDINANCE
MEASURE L

An initiative to repeal the City of King's two-percent (2%) utility
users' tax has been presented to the City of King and has
qualified for placement on the November 5, 2002 ballot for
consideration by the voters of the City of King. The initiative
would amend tne King City Municipal Code by repealing the
utility users' tax, first adopted by the City of King in 1993, in its
entirety.

The present ordinance places a two percent (2%) tax oh
charges for the following utilities: telephone, electricity, gas
(delivered through mains or pipes), water and cable television.
The utility users' tax accounts annually for approximately
$200,000 of the City's General Fund revenue. General Fund
revenues are used to provide many general City services such
as police and fire protection, public works, recreation, and for
other municipal purposes.

If the initiative is approved by a majority of the voters voting on
the measure, the repeal of the utility users' tax will take effect on
January 1, 2003. Passage of this measure would remove
approximately $200,000 annually from the City of King's
General Fund revenues and mean the City would have
approximately $200,000 less in annual tax revenues available
for the payment of general governmental activities such as
police and fire protection, public works, and recreation, than it
would receive if the initiative were not approved. If the initiative
were not approved, the City would continue to receive tax
revenues at the same 2% tax rate currently in effect.

s/ Michael Jencks, City Attorney

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure L.
If you desire a copy of the measure, please call the City
Clerk’s office at (83T) 385-3281 and a copy will be mailed at
no cost to you.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE L
UTILITY TAX RELIEF INITIATIVE

Vote "YES" for fairness!

Insurance companies, government, and some big business
utility users can enjoy tax relief; but many small businesses and
residents in King City do not.

Vote "YES" to help your neighbors!

Those who earn the least, pay the highest percent of their
income for this tax; including struggling families and senior
citizens.

This tax is also imposed on small businesses, churches,
nonprofit organizations, and families at all income levels.

Vote "YES" to repeal the utility users tax as of next year!

This tax is added to your cost of gas, electricity, water, cable,

and telephone services: and it's not restricted to being spent on
utilities or on any SPECIFIC city service. It can be spent - or
misspent - any way the City Council chooses.

The fact is that more than 300 cities throughout California
balance their budgets and provide vital services WITHOUT
a utility users tax on their residents and businesses!

Pro-tax advocates want to keep this regressive tax. They have
been fighting against taxpayers for years. Each time they
warned of cuts to services if we didn't support them, and each
time we learned that they were wrong after we won.

We, can spend our money better than government can,
because it's our money!

Vote "YES" on Measure L to repeal the utility users tax and
give yourself and your neighbors a helping hand!

s/ Bob R. Hall, Retired Public Safety Officer
s/ Herman R. Dillingham, Retired Construction
s/ Eugene L. Richardson, Retired Utility
s/ Jim AlbanesP, Self Employed

NO REBUTTAL ARGUMENT WAS SUBMITTED

Those that are behind the effort to repeal the utility users' tax
do not have the community of King City as their priority. If they
did, this measure would not be on the ballot. We can explain
why.

The average household pays about 16 cents per day on the
utility users tax. That's per household, not per person. And that
daily 16 cents is an investment in this community that helps to
make King City a great place to live, work and raise your family.

That 16 cents helps to fund the volunteer Fire Department,
whose dedication and commitment to King City is unquestioned.
That 16 cents helps to fund the Police Department, which
continues in its efforts to work with you through such programs
as community-based policing and D.A.R.E. And that 16 cents
is fundamental to the recreation programs that benefit the
children of King City, such as the summer pool and soccer
leagues for all ages.

No one likes to pay taxes. But the utility users' tax provides
funds that can only be used on the local level. These revenues
are solely for the benefit of your community. The funds that
result from the 16 cents paid per day per household are an
investment in your hometown. If Measure L passes, the Fire
Department may not have the equipment needed for an
emergency in the future. Police programs may be reduced or
recreational facilities not improved. The quality of life for King
City residents will be negatively impacted if this measure
passes.

We all believe in the future of King City. The best way to ensure
that the future is bright is to make certain that our investment in
the community remains steady. That investment will be secured
by a NO VOTE ON MEASURE L.

s/ Bruce Miller, Sergeant KCPD
s/ Vince Lopez / S valley Auto Plaza, Owner
s/ Scott David Brennan, President

King City Chamber of Commerce & Agriculture

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE L

We are lifelong King City residents who want to help our
community, and believe that you can manage your money better
than the city.

Many cities with this tax made a windfall from higher gas and
electric bills last year. Did the city pave your street or tix your
sidewalks? Not likely. But they have spent a lot of money on
the Town Square.

•	A "YES" vote will repeal this utility tax and save $73 for the
average family this year, and more for a small family business.

This tax has never been restricted for public safety, or any
specific use. It has been spent - or misspent - any way the City
Council has chosen.

*	Public safety services are not optional expenses, and like
other services, have existed long before this tax.

Voters need to hold city council members responsible for
wasteful spending.

Taxpayers never voted for this tax, and ft can be repealed. In
fact, more than two-thirds of California cities, over 300, balance
their budgets and provide for public safety WITHOUT a utility
users tax!

v Vote "YES" on Measure L to REPEAL the utility users tax.
