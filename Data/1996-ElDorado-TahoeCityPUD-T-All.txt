F. PREPAYMENTS

Any property owner in CFD No, 1996-1 who desires to prepay the
Special Tax on a particular Parcel shall notify the TCPUD in
writing of such intention and determine, or cause to be determined
the amount of prepayment no more than sixty (60) days and no less
than thirty (30) days prior to date of such prepayment (the
♦'Prepayment Date'1). The Prepayment Date must be on or before Jur
1 to avcici the levy of a Special Tax on the Parcel in the following
Fiscal Year* A Special Tw.x shall, be levied in the following Fiscal
Year on Parcels for which a Prepayment Date is to occur after June
1 anci such prepayment amount shall be reduced to account for the
collection of the Special Tax from the Parcel in that Fiscal Year*
Tne prepayment amount shall be an amount equal to the sum of the
following•

-all delinquent Special Taxes, penalties and interest applicable
to the subject Parcel (if any);

-the applicable Fair Share (as defined below) for the Parcel
requesting prepayment;

-the premium required to be prepaid (if any) in connection with the
redemption of bonds as a result of such prepayment;

-an estimated amount necessary to cover negative arbitrage from the
date of the prepayment to the first call date on the bonds, if
applicable; and

-Prepayment Fees, as defined below.

The prepayment amount calculated for any Parcel shall be reduced
by the following:

-the Reserve Fund Credit (as defined below), and

-the amount of any Special Tax applicable to the subject Parcel
that has been posted to the current tax roll and will be paid
separately by the owner of the Parcel.

When a prepayment is requested, TCPUD shall determine if bonds for
CFD No. 1996-1 have been issued* Based on this determination, a
Parcel’s “Fair Share" shall be calculated as follows:

(1) Prior to.Bond Issue for CFD No. 1996-1 - the Fair Share shall

be calculated as follows:

Step l.a:	Estimate the total Special Taxes that can be collected

within the CPD by applying the Maximum Special Tax to all Parcels
of Developed Property and Core Commercial Property in the CFD as
of the Formation Date.

Step l.b:	For a Parcel of Developed Property, divide $15 by tne

amount calculated in Step l.a to determine the Parcel’s share of
Maximum Special Tax revenues. For a Parcel of Core Commercial
Property, divide the annual Maximum Special Tax reflected in
Exhibit B by the amount calculated in Step l.a to determine the
Parcel's share of Maximum special Tax revenues.

Step l.c:	Multiply the percentage determined in Step l.b by the

principal amount of facilities to be funded by CFD No 1996-1. The
product represents the Parcel's snare of the facility costs to be
funded by the CFD♦

Step l*d:	Determine the current value of special taxes that have

already been collected from the prepaying Parcel by applying a four
percent (4%) inflation factor, compounded annually, from the Fiscal
Year in which the Special Taxes were levied to the Fiscal Year in
which prepayment will be received;

Step l.e:	Subtract	the	amount	determined	in	Step l.d from the

amount calculated in Step l.c to determine the Parcel's Fair Share.
If this amount is determined to be. a negative number, the Parcel
has fully mitigated its impacts and there will be no further
prepayment required.

(2) After Bonds Have Been Issued by CFD No. 1996-1 - the Fair
Share shall be the Parcel's share of outstanding Bonds whicn shall
be determined through the application of Steps 2. a through 2.d
below.

Step 2.a:	Estimate the total Special Taxes that can be collected

within the CFD by applying the Maximum Special Tax to all Parcels
of Developed Property and Core Commercial Property in the CFD a.-
of the most recent Special Tax levy.

Step 2.b:	For a Parcel of Developed Property, divide $15 by the

amount calculated in Step 2.a to determine the Parcel's share of
Maximum Special Tax revenues. For a Parcel of core commercia
Property, divide the annual Maximum Special Tax reflected in
Exhibit B or, for Parcels that did not exist as of the Formation
Date, the Maximum Special Tax that was assigned to the parcel vher
the Building Square Footage was determined, by the amount
calculated in Step 2.a to determine the Parcel's share of Maxim
Special Tax revenues.

Step 2,c:	Subtract	the Bond principal that will have been paid

prior to the Prepayment Date from the total principal amount of all
outstanding Bonds to determine the net principal outstanding;

Step 2.d:	Multiply	the	percentage	determined	in	Step 2.b by the

net principal outstanding determined in Step 2.c to determine the
Parcel's Fair Share of outstanding Bonds.

"Reserve Fund Credit" shall be calculated as a reduction in the
Reserve Fund for the Bonds, proportional to the principal amount
of bonds to be redeemed pursuant to the prepayment.

"Prepayment Fees" shall mean the sum of fees of CFD No. 1996-1, the

8

bo,if pRou/oe Mftr

fiscal agent, TCPUD staff time, and any consultants retained in
connection with the prepayment calculation and bond, redemption and
any other fees and expenses associated with the prepayment, as
determined by the TCPUD.
