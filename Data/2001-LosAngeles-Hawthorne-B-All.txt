ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE B

Dear Friends,

On November 6, 2001, you have an opportunity to help your city’s budget by
supporting Measure B, the Hotel/Motel Bed Tax. This Measure will not cost you
a penny.

We have 2 brand new hotels in Hawthorne. Our hotels will be highly competitive
with the hotel/motel businesses in nearby cities, and market studies project that
visitors will be flocking to our new hotels because of their great location.

Our present hotel/motel bed tax is one of the very lowest in South Bay. Your
vote to support the 12% Hotel/Motel Bed Tax will bring our budget a major
windfall. This will help pay for our newest endeavors: a skate board park for our
children, a new police station with more police and 911 services, graffiti cleanup,
improved park facilities for families, pool maintenance and many more benefits
for all citizens.

Your vote in favor of Measure B is supported by all members of the Hawthorne
City Council, and eveiy member of City Staff. The rewards will be yours as we
will gain more revenue to serve you better in every department.

I

f We need your support in November. Please vote YES for Measure B
