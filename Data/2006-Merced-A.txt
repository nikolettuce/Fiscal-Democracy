Summary

This Plan will guide the use of more than $446 million in locally raised and locally controlled transportation funds
The revenue will be generated through the passage of the Merced County Transportation Measure, a % cent sales
tax, if approved by the voters in the June 6, 2006 election.

Why does Merced County need a transportation sales tax?

Our transportation system is in crisis. There is not enough money available to maintain our roads or to build
improvements to relieve congestion. We are falling farther behind each year. Existing sources of revenue are simply
inadequate, because our needs have increased while funding has not. A sales tax is one of the only means of raising
money that we can do ourselves. About $446 million would be raised over the 30-year life of a % cent tax, leveraqinq
an additional $1 billion from State and Federal sources.	'	'

What will this plan do for me?

• Local street and road maintenance and repairs will be significantly increased.

8 improvements such as road widening and new roadways will be built in communities throughout Merced
County. See page 4.

8 Transit service (“The Bus”) will be improved by adding routes and increasing frequency on existing routes.

We already pay taxes for roads. Where does that money go?

„	9°®s	t0	r°ads.	Unfortunately, it is not enough, and hasn’t been for years. Gas taxes have not increased since

1994, so buying power has decreased while road use has gone up dramatically.

What about development? Will newcomers pay for new roads?

Yes. Most areas have impact fee programs to charge new growth for its impacts on the transportation system.

24A1

Also, there is now a Regional Transportation Impact Fee to help fund regional projects necessary to serve new
growth.	*

How can I be sure the money will be spent well?

The money will be put into special accounts that can only be spent on transportation. An independent oversight
committee of citizens will annually audit the funds, review the projects, and report its findings to the public.

How will the money be spent?

The Expenditure Plan provides for investments in three categories. Each category will receive a percentage
share of sales tax revenues. Up to one percent of the revenues can be allocated for plan administration.

Background

Our transportation infrastructure is overburdened as our demand to travel continually increases. This comes as
no surprise to the people who live or work in Merced County. Transportation issues are consistently identified as a
primary concern of County and Valley residents.

There is no single solution to our transportation problems, and there is no single source that can fully fund all of
our mobility needs. Transportation projects in Merced County are funded in a variety of ways, including local shares
of gas tax and sales tax, grants from federal and state government, and other means. However, current funding will
not be adequate to maintain the existing transportation system and will not keep pace with the growth in demands of
an increasingly mobile Merced County over the coming 30 years.

One of the few avenues for funding that can be directly controlled by Merced County residents is a transportation
sales tax. While the sales tax will not close the funding gap, it provides a significant opportunity to improve our trans-
portation system.

This Transportation Sales Tax Expenditure Plan outlines a program for spending a half-cent (1/2-cent) increase
in sales taxes, to be entirely dedicated to transportation purposes in Merced County. This plan is intended to provide
a high degree of accountability, while maintaining the flexibility needed to respond to emerging transportation issues
over a 30-year period.

This Transportation Sales Tax Expenditure Plan was developed with extensive input from the public and from the
cities and communities throughout the County. Dozens of public meetings were held to gather opinions and the Plan
was crafted in response to what was heard. The plan was further shaped by input from the cities and County of
Merced.

Becoming a “Self-Help” County will help Merced get its fair share of state and federal sources. While a sales tax
alone will not solve all of our transportation problems, implementing a transportation sales tax, approved by two-thirds
of the voters of Merced County, opens new opportunities for leveraging or matching our local money with state and
federal sources that require a local share. Using leveraging, our local sales tax has the potential of generating more
funding from outside sources than the amount generated locally, while setting Merced County on a course of inde-
pendence that will allow us to determine our own priorities for transportation projects.

Revenue

The transportation sales tax will be A%\ that is an additional A cent on each dollar of taxable goods and services.
Over the 30-year duration of the tax, it is estimated that $446 million would be raised. Expenditures described in this
plan are based on this estimate, but actual expenditures will depend on the actual revenues received, which could be
more, or less.

It is expected that additional revenues will be attracted to Merced County because of its status as a “Self-Help”
County. These would come in the form of state and federal dollars that would otherwise not come to this county. It is
estimated that up to $1 billion in additional funds could come to Merced County, based on the experiences of other
counties, which have sales taxes specifically for transportation.

Expenditure Categories

The Expenditure Plan provides for investments in three categories. Each category will receive a percentage
share of sales tax revenues. Up to one percent of the revenues can be allocated for plan administration.

Descriptions of program categories follow.

1.	Priority Projects County wide

Fifty percent (50%) of the funds will be allocated to this program. The Governing Board of the Merced County
Association of Governments is the decision-maker for allocating these funds.

The purpose of this program is to fund improvements, which will increase safety, increase capacity, reduce con-
gestion, improve access, and promote economic development.

2.	Local Roads Maintenance and Improvements

Forty-four and one-half percent (44.5%) of the funds will be allocated to this program. The decision-maker for
these funds will be the local elected council or board.

This program provides money for local street and road repairs, routine maintenance, safety improvements,
rebuilding roads that have deteriorated due to a lack of funds, and related improvements.

Every year, the funds will be divided among the seven local governments according to a formula, as follows:

•	the County of Merced will receive half (50%) of the funds;

•	each city will receive a base amount of $75,000;

° the remainder will be allocated to the cities in shares based 2/3 on their population and 1/3 on their main-
tained centerline road miles.

Table 2 shows how the funds would be divided by jurisdiction assuming $198,000,000 is available over 30 years
for this program.

Table 2: Allocations for Local Roads Maintenance and Improvements

Jurisdiction	Average  Annual  Allocation	30 Year Total
City of Atwater	$550,000	$17,000,000
City of Dos Palos	$225,000	$6,500,000
City of Gustine	$225,000	$6,000,000
City of Livingston	$325,000	$9,500,000
City of Los Banos	$550,000	$17,000,000
City of Merced	$1,425,000	$43,000,000
County of Merced	$3,300,000	$99,000,000
Total	$6,600,000	$198,000,000

3.	Transit Service Improvements

Four and one-half percent (4.5%) of the funds will be allocated to this program. The Merced County Transit Joint
Powers Authority is the decision-maker for allocating these funds. It is estimated that $20 million will be available over
30 years, or about $660,000 per year.

Transit service, transit vehicle purchase, and related transit capital improvements are an essential element of the
county’s transportation system.

Projects which could be funded under this program include:

•	stabilization of fares for seniors and the disabled
° extension of service periods

° new and extended routes

•	new and low emission transit vehicles
° transit stops and transfer facilities and maintenance/fueling facilities

The use of the funds will be^ consistent with the Short-Range Transit Plan and Annual Transit Service Plan.
Administration
Authority and Governance

This transportation sales tax is authorized under the “Local Transportation Authority and Improvement Act”,
California Public Utilities Code Section 180000 et. Seq. In approving this tax, the voters will authorize that the Merced
County Association of Governments (abbreviated MCAG and referred to as “Association” hereafter) be given the
responsibility to administer the tax proceeds. The Association’s policy- and decision-making body is its Governing
Board, which consists of 11 elected officials in Merced County, as follows:

•	all five members of the Merced County Board of Supervisors

•	one elected representative from each of the six cities in the county, to be selected by the elected governing
body of each city

Staffing and Administration Expenses

The Association will employ and/or contract staff and professional assistance required to administer the pro-
ceeds of the tax and implement this Expenditure Plan. The total cost of salaries and benefits for administrative
Association employees will not exceed 1% of the revenues generated by the authorized sales tax collected to support
this Plan. The Association will prepare an annual report, identifying the total expenditures for administration, as well
as other costs associated with delivering the program.

Duration of Tax

The duration of the tax will be 30 years. It will begin on October 1,2006. It will end on August 31, 2036.

Use of Funds

Sales tax proceeds will be used to pay for transportation purposes, specifically the programs and projects out-
lined in this Expenditure Plan, and may not be used for any other purpose. Local jurisdictions may not redirect monies
currently being used for transportation purposes to other purposes and then replace the redirected funds with dollars
provided by this tax.

Amendments to the Plan

The Association may annually review and propose amendments to the Expenditure Plan to provide for the use of
additional federal, state, or local funds, to account for unexpected revenue, or to take into consideration unforeseen
circumstances. Amendments to this Plan will require a majority vote (6 of 11 members) of the Governing Board of the
Association, following a noticed public hearing and a 45-day public comment period.

Annual Budget

An Expenditure Plan Budget will be adopted by the Association each year. The Budget will estimate the expect-
ed sales tax receipts and planned expenditures for administration, programs, and projects. The Budget will also iden-
tify the priority for projects and the schedule for each project’s implementation based on its readiness, the availability
of funds from other sources, and other relevant criteria. The Budget will be adopted at a public meeting of the
Association’s Governing Board.

Bonding Authority

The Association will be authorized to use bond financing as an alternative to “pay as you go” financing. The
Association will have the authority to issue bonds payable from the proceeds of the tax for the construction of needed
transportation improvements. The Association, in allocating the annual revenues from the tax, will be responsible for
meeting all debt service requirements prior to allocating funds for other projects.

Establishment of Special Accounts

The Association and each local jurisdiction receiving funds from the tax shall deposit them in a separate interest
bearing Transportation Improvement Account. Any interest earned on funds from the tax will be expended only for
those purposes for which the funds were deposited, or will be returned to the Association.

Development Mitigation

To receive funds from the Local Roads Maintenance and Improvements program of this plan, a jurisdiction must
have a development mitigation program and be collecting transportation impact fees, including, but not limited to, the
Regional Transportation Impact Fee, to insure that new growth pays for its share of the transportation infrastructure
costs associated with that growth.

Accountability

This plan has been designed to provide accountability to the taxpayers and maximum opportunity for public
involvement.

Public Proceedings

All business of the Association will be conducted in an open and public meeting process. All decisions will be
conducted in compliance with the Brown Act, also known as the Open Meeting Law, which requires that meetings of
public bodies must be open and public, and actions may not be secret. The Association will also ensure that ade-
quate public involvement has been included in the preparation of all plans and budgets.

Audit

The Association will hire an independent auditor who will audit all sales tax revenues and expenditures, ensuring
that they are made in accordance with the plan.

Citizen s Advisory Committee

The Association’s Citizens Advisory Committee will serve as a “watchdog”, overseeing implementation of the
Plan. It will report directly to the public and will be charged with reviewing all matters related to the Expenditure Plan.
The Committee will generally meet once a month. The Committee reviews Association staff work, recommends
actions to the Association Governing Board, and provides staff with input on transportation planning issues. With pas-
sage of the sales tax, the responsibilities of the committee will be expanded to include:

. issuance of a report, on at least an annual basis, to inform Merced County residents how the Expenditure
Plan funds are being spent
° review and comment on the independent audit

Citizens Advisory Committee members are private citizens who are not elected officials at any level of govern-
ment, nor public employees from agencies that either oversee or benefit from the proceeds of the sales tax.
Membership is restricted to individuals who live in Merced County. Members must submit a statement of financial dis-
closure and membership will be restricted to individuals with no economic interests in any Association projects or any
projects of its member jurisdictions.

The Committee is designed to reflect the diversity of the County and includes 14 members. Membership is as fol-
lows:

• Five at-large members will be selected with a consideration to geographic distribution in the county.

» Nine members will be selected to reflect a balance of viewpoints across the county. <summaryend>







<impartial> COUNTY COUNSEL’S IMPARTIAL
ANALYSIS OF REGIONAL
TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT TAX
MEASURE A

ON FEBRUARY 14, 2006, THE MERCED
COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ORDERED THE
CALLING OF A SPECIAL ELECTION FOR THE PUR-
POSE OF SUBMITTING TO THE QUALIFIED ELEC-
TORS OF MERCED COUNTY A ONE-HALF (1/2)
PERCENT SPECIAL SALES TAX FOR REGIONAL
TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS AND CON-
SOLIDATE THE SPECIAL COUNTY ELECTION WITH
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PRIMARY ELECTION
TO BE HELD ON TUESDAY, JUNE 6, 2006.

Measure A will authorize a one-half (1/2) cent sales
and use tax on all retail sales for the County by the
Merced County Association of Governments (“MCAG”)
for a thirty (30) year period. Measure A’s purpose is to
relieve traffic congestion and improve safety and air
quality by repairing and improving local roads and
County Highways.

Revenues from Measure A will be used to repair
pot holes, improve local roads, widen County and local

highways, and provide public transportation accessibility
and services for seniors and persons with disability.
Developer impact fees will supplement Measure A funds.

All revenue generated by Measure A will remain in
Merced County and cannot be taken by the State of
California. The revenues from Measure A will allow the
County to leverage over one billion dollars in matching
state funds for transportation projects.

An independent Taxpayer Watchdog Committee will
conduct yearly audits, review transportation projects and
insure that all funds are used appropriately as approved
by the voters. If Measure A is approved, the revenues
from the one-half (1/2) cent sales and use tax will be
expended as follows:

•	50% of the funds for County-wide projects includ-
ing widening Highway 99 to six lanes, realigning
Highway 59, constructing a Bypass on Highway
152 in Los Banos, and realigning Highway 165 to
bypass the City of Hilmar.

•	44.5% of the revenues generated by the special
sales and use tax under Measure A would be
used for local road maintenance and public safety
projects, including filling pot holes, repaving roads, and installing sidewalks, gutters, shoul-
ders, curves, and bypasses.

• 4.5% of the revenues generated by Measure A
would be used for transit services, accessibility
and new routes.

• The remaining 1% of the revenues generated by
Measure A would be expended for administrative
costs and independent Tax Watchdog Committee
audit.

Measure A revenue would be placed in a spe-
cial account designated for transportation projects
only. Measure A requires further vote of the qualified
voters in order to increase or extend the sales and
use tax beyond the stated 30-year period.

Measure A requires two-third (2/3) voter approval
and if approved would go into effect on October 1, 2006.

A YES VOTE would mean that the voter is in favor
of Measure A special sales and use tax for required
regional transportation improvements and if two-third
(2/3) of the qualified voters voting for this Measure vote
“yes”, Measure A will pass and one-half percent special
sales and use tax would be authorized.

A NO VOTE would mean that the voter is against
Measure A and opposed to the assessment of a one-half
percent sales and use tax for regional transportation
needs in the County of Merced. <impartialend>

MERCED COUNTY COUNSEL <impartialsigsend>






<favor> ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE A

Vote Yes on Measure A to fix potholes, relieve con-
gestion and air pollution, improve safety and get Merced
County moving.

Measure A funds will stay in Merced County — the
State cannot take one penny and local money means
local control of our tax dollars.

Measure A will repave local roads, and improve traf-
fic in neighborhoods throughout Merced County — from
the City of Merced to Los Banos, Gustine, Livingston,
Atwater, Dos Palos and everywhere in between.

Vote YES to widen Highway 99 to six lanes and
make other major safety and capacity improvements to
Highways 59, 140, 152, and 165.

Vote YES to make our children’s routes to schools
safer by adding sidewalks, improving bike lanes and
upgrading shoulders on local roads and highways.

Vote YES to synchronize traffic signals, widen local
streets and add turn lanes to improve traffic flow on rural
roads.

Measure A will attract job and economic develop-
ment to Merced County. Major road construction projects
will provide jobs to boost our local economy and
improved roads will more efficiently transport agricultural
goods.

Vote YES to expand and improve transit services for
senior citizens, people with disabilities and others who
rely on public transportation.

Vote Yes to safeguard your tax dollars. An indepen-
dent taxpayers’ oversight committee will hotel officials
accountable and review audits annually to ensure voter
mandates are met.

It’s important to remember that new housing devel-
opment will pay for its fair share of transportation
improvements through developer fees that will supple-
ment Measure A funds.

Without Measure A, transportation projects will be
delayed for decades. Measure A will make our county eli-
gible for an additional One Billion dollars in matching
state transportation dollars — funds that will be spent on
fixing roads elsewhere unless we pass Measure A.

Please join us and many other supporters from
across Merced County in voting Yes on A.
