IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY MONO COUNTY COUNSEL
MEASURE E

Eastern Sierra Unified School District General Obligation Bonds
If there is a 55% vote in lavor of Measure E, then the Eastern Sierra Unified School
District (the "District") will issue and sell bonds to fund the following construction,
reconstruction, rehabilitation, and replacement projects at school facilities within the District:

•	Upgrade electrical, plumbing, and / or air ventilation systems

•	Construct a new Elementary school in the Challanl area
■ Expand specific buildings at existing campuses

•	Modernize and renovate buildings and classrooms

•	Modernize science and computer labs

•	Repair leaky roofs

•	Improve and expand student safety by making repairs and improving lighting and

As require by law, the District will also conduct annual independent performance
audits of projects funded with bond proceeds, will conduct independent financial
audits, and will establish and appoint members to an independent citizens' oversight
committee to oversee the expenditure of the bond funds.

If there is a 55% vote in favor of Measure E, then the District will also cause to be
levied on annual ad valorem property tax (a tax based on the assessed value of
property) on properties within the district in order to pay debt service on the bonds.
Ad valorem property taxes ordinarily cannot be levied above 1% of the property's full
cash value. But under Article XIII A, Section 1(b) of the California Constitution, the
1% limit may be exceeded (with 55% voter approval) if the tax revenues are used
to pay debt service on bonded Indebtedness incurred by a school district for the
construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation, or replacement of school facilities.

The maximum amount of the proposed bonded indebtedness is $11,100,000. The
maximum duration of the Bonds will be 25 years or 40 years - depending upon the
type of bonds issued, and the maximum interest rate for the bonds will be 12%. The
exact effect of the issue and sale of the Bonds on tax rates cannot be determined
until the Bonds have been sold. Estimated Information regarding tax rates is available
in the Tax Rate Statement, which Is provided in this pamphlet.

II the measure is not approved by at least 55% of the qualified electors voting on
the measure, the measure will fail and no bonds will be Issued.

A “yes" vote is a vote to authorize the Eastern Sierra Unified School District to issue and
sell the Bonds and to levy taxes to pay for the debt service on the Bonds.

A "no” vote is a vote against authorizing the Eastern Sierra Unified School District
to issue and sell the Bonds.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure E, submitted by the Office
of the Mono County Counsel pursuant to the requirements of Section 9500 et seq.
of the California Elections Code. If you would like a copy of the measure, please
call the election official’s office at (760) 932-5530 and a copy will be mailed to you

Voters should note that the estimated tax rates are based on the ASSESSED VALUE
of taxable property on the County's official tax rolls, not on the property’s market
value. Property owners should consult their own property tax bills to determine their
property's assessed value and any applicable tax exemptions.

Attention of all voters is directed to the fact that the foregoing information is based
upon the District's projections and estimates only, which are not binding upon the
District. The actual tax rales and the years in which they will apply may vary from
those presently estimated, due lo variations from these estimates in the timing of
bond sales, the amounl ol bonds sold and market interest rates at the lime of each
sale, and actual assessed valuations over the term of repayment of the bonds. The
dates ol sale and the amounl of bonds sold al any given lime will be determined by
the District based on need lor construction funds and other factors, including the
legal limitations on bonds approved by a 55% vote. The actual interest rates at which
Ihe bonds will be sold will depend on the bond market al the lime of each sale.
Actual future assessed valuation will depend upon the amount and value of taxable
property within the District as determined by the County Assessor in the annual
assessment and the equalization process.
