REVISED *  IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL FOR MEASURE A SPECIAL TAX FOR SOLID WASTE  By law, counties must have a solid waste program. Siskiyou County has partially funded its solid waste program with parcel fees. During the 1997-98 fiscal year the County has utilized gate fees as a means to augment funding and to balance the solid waste program budget.  Measure A, if approved, by two-thirds of the voters voting on the measure, would authorize the Board of Supervisors to increase the Transactions and Use Tax (sales tax) by one half of one percent with the tax proceeds being used for the exclusive purpose of funding the solid waste program. By law, the funds would be held in a separate account to be used only for solid waste funding.  The measure, if passed, would increase the Transactions and Use Tax (sales tax) by one half of one percent county wide; both within the cities as well as the unincorporated areas of the County. The measure, if passed, is expected to raise approximately 1.7 million dollars.	NO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF OR AGAINST THIS MEASURE WAS SUBMITTED.
