On January 29, 2013, by an 8-4 vote, the Los Angeles City Council voted to refer
Measure D to the ballot. The city council took this action in response to the fact that the
backers of Measures E and F had submitted signatures on petitions to election officials
to qualify their initiatives for the ballot.

What it does

Measure D establishes the following:

•	Allows the 135 dispensaries approved under the interim control ordinance of
September 2007 to stay open, if they follow the city's rules on proximity to
schools, churches and neighborhoods.[2]

•	Places a new tax of $60 per $1,000 of marijuana sold. This represents an
increase of $10 per $1,000 of sales over current levels of marijuana
taxation. [3]

Who supported it

Mayoral candidate Eric Garcetti supported the city council's measure. He said, "It does
ensure access and gives us some semblance of control in our neighborhood."[3]

Measure D was also backed by the United Food and Commercial Workers Union. This
group also supported Measure E, but saw Measure D as an appropriate compromise
between Measures E and F.[2]

Councilman Paul Koretz supported Measure D, saying, "Neither of these two initiatives
[Measures E and F] are perfect and one would have far too little regulation. But we have
a third proposal that would bring in tax revenue and maintain access for medical
marijuana patients."[3]

Ballot question

The question on the ballot:

Measure D: "Shall an ordinance regulating businesses where marijuana
is cultivated, processed, distributed, delivered or given away to qualified
patients or primary caregivers (MMBs) by: (1) prohibiting MMBs but
providing limited immunity for MMBs that operated since September
2007, timely registered with the City, generally have not ceased
operations, pay City taxes, pass annual background checks, are
separated from residential zones, maintain certain distances from
schools, parks, child care facilities, other designated places and other
MMBs, and meet other requirements and operational standards; (2)
exempting dwelling units used by three or fewer patients/caregivers to
cultivate medical marijuana on-site for their patients or themselves, and
other exemptions; and (3) increasing the MMB tax to $60 per each
$1,000 of gross receipts; be adopted?"[6]
