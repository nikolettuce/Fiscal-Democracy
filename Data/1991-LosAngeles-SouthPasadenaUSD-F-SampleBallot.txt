ANALYSIS OF PROPOSITION F

By D«Witt W. Clinton, County Counsel

Approval of this ballot measure would allow the South Pasadena Unified
School District to impose a special tax of up to $ 100 per year upon each parcel
of real property located wholly or partially within the District, effective
immediately.

The maximum permissible yearly tax authorized by this measure may not be
exceeded in any year in which the tax is assessed, but may be lower. Taxpayers
65 years of age or older who own and occupy single family residential parcels
may, upon application to the Board of Education, obtain an exemption from
the tax. The tax would be levied each year for a maximum of 4 years.

The special tax would be used to expand the school curriculum, retain and
attract highly qualified teachers and support personnel, acquire up-to-date
instructional materials and equipment, maintain and improve classrooms and
existing facilities, and reduce class size.

A two-thirds (2/3) vote is required for passage of the measure

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION F

Throughout the 1980s, the South Pasadena Unified School District has strug-
gled to maintain its traditionally excellent educational program in face of
chronic State underfunding. Despite the efforts of the South Pasadena Educa-
tional Foundation, the PTAs, the Tiger Booster Club and other dedicated sup-
porters of public education, our district has been forced to make deep budget
cuts to live within a State per pupil revenue allocation among the lowest in
Los Angeles County. Now, in face of an unprecedented State deficit, we must
protect ourselves by providing an additional revenue source upon which the
district can depend as it makes the critical decisions which will shape the future
of our children and our community.

WITH MEASURE ZJT, EVERYONE WINS!

—	Education provides the tools by which our children will become effective
leaders and citizens in the 21st century.

—	Education excellence through (I) recruitment and retention of highly
skilled teachers, (2) reduction in class size, and (3) restoration of a broad
and up-to-date curriculum to meet the needs of all of our children cannot
be achieved without additional community financial support.

—	Every homeowner, whether or not the parent of a school-age child, bene-
fits from excellent public schools. Our property values and our communi-
ty’s character are directly linked to the quality of our public education
system.

—	Exemptions from this revenue measure are available to every Senior Citi-
zen homeowner-resident over the age of 65.

—	Enacting Measure F will enhance local control of public education and
enable our district to have additional resources to meet the difficult chal-
lenges which face us.
