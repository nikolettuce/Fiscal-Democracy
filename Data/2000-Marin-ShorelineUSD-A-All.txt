ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE A

Our community has wisely supported a local parcel tax since
1984. This support has enabled the Shoreline Unified School
District to maintain quality programs in the areas of school
libraries, art, drama, music, foreign language, counseling, and
technology. Your parcel tax has also helped to continue
supporting the hiring of classroom aides where needed. The
purchase of current textbooks and materials to enhance math,
reading, and writing courses have also been supported by the
previous parcel taxes.

Measure A will allow the community’s students to continue
receiving services and instruction in these areas, along with
continuing specialty programs that enrich their total education
experience.

The programs that are supported by Measure A can only
be maintained by the continuation of this Parcel Tax. These
important programs cannot be maintained through the general
budget.

As the challenges of maintaining, a strong quality public
education for our community’s children continue to build, so does
the importance of maintaining these important programs. Our
children must be able to compete in a very demanding world.
These programs help give students a well-rounded quality
education. A balanced education is critical in order for students to
develop into educated and contributing members of our society.

Remember, Measure A in a continuation of the support the
community has given to its schools since 1984. Please continue
this important support by voting YES on MEASURE A.
