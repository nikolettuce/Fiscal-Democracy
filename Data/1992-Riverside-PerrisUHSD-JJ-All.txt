IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE "JJ"

The Board of Trustees of the Perris Union High School District
fPUHSD") has formed a community facilities district ("CFO No. 92-1")
within the Menifee area of the PUHSD's boundaries. The portions of
the Menifee area zoned for a restriction to occupancy by seniors only
were not included within CFO No. 92-1. Individual residences
occupied by seniors would be able to obtain an exemption from the
special tax of CFD No. 92-1. Bonds would be issued by CFO No. 92-1
for the purpose of constructing, acquiring, and financing school facilities
(the "Classrooms")- Measure JJ provides for:	(i)	the	issuance	of

Bonds in an amount not to exceed $40,000,000; (if) for the imposition
of a special tax to pay for the Classrooms, including interest on the
Bonds; and (iii) for the establishment of an appropriations limit to permit
the expenditure of the proceeds of the tax.

The proceeds from the Bonds authorized through Measure JJ
would be used to finance the Classrooms for the PUHSD. The term of
the Bonds could not exceed 40 years. The interest rate on the bonds
would be determined at sale, but could not exceed 12% per year. If
sold at the present time, the interest rate would be substantially less.

The amount of the tax each year would raise funds to pay for
facilities financing costs, including current debt service, reserve funding
and related incidental expenses. The first year in which the special
taxes may be charged is the 1993/94 fiscal year. The special tax
would be charged on all property, not exempt, within the area of CFD No.
92-1. The special tax is payable twice a year with property taxes and
is determined on a monthly amount per parcel based on land use and
whether or not the property was developed on or prior to November 17,
1392. For property developed on or before November 17, 1992, the
initial annual maximum special tax rates will be computed on the basts
of $2.00 per unit per month for single family detached houses, $1.09
per unit per month for single family attached and mobile home units, and
51.00 per unit per month for multi-family units. For property
developed after November 17, 1992, the initial annual maximum
special tax rates will be computed on the basis of $15 17 per unit per
month per single family detached residence. $8.25 per unit per month
per single family attached and mobile home units and $7.59 per unit per
month per multi-family units. Property developing after November 17,
1992, will also be subject to a one-time special tax payable on a per
square foot basis when building permits are issued. The maximum
special tax rates would increase based on art inflationary index.

In order to spend tax proceeds, it is necessary to establish an
appropriations limit for CFD No. 92-1. The annual limit under Measure
JJ would equal the amount of the Bond authorization.

Measure JJ is being submitted only to those voters within the area
of CFD No. 92-1. Under present law this Measure requires a 2/3
affirmative vote to pass.

Special Counsel to the Perris Union High School District

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE JJ

The provision of quality secondary educational programs and services
demand a high school with appropriately equipped classrooms, labora-
tories, library, physical education facilities and grounds as an invest-
ment in your children and community. At the present time, the Perris

Union High School District houses 559 high school students from the
Menifee Union School District area in facilities located at the Perris
High School and Annex sites. The proposed $37.4 million Paloma
Valley High School is designed to house 2,200 students. An increase
of 256 percent in the number of grade 9-12 students residing within the
Menifee Union School District is projected by fall of 1996. This school
is needed.

In the Fall of 1991, the Perris Union High School District successfully
attained an "A-” investment rating for the sale of $4,995,000
Certificates of Participation to fund site acquisition, architectural
design, anti other initial costs associated with the financing of the
construction of the first phase of Paloma Valley High School. With the
successful passage of Proposition 152 State School Bond Measure, the
Perris Union High School District on July 22, 1992, received state
approval and funding of $12.3 million towards the construction of the
first phase of Paloma Valley High School. Passage of this ballot
proposition will ensure the timely construction of not only the first phase
but the complete four-year comprehensive high school for the education
of the students as well as civic and recreational activities of the
community. The investment for residents living in existing single
family homes will be $2 a month and $15.17 a month for future
residents in future single family homes. Certainly, the proposed return
on this minimal investment guarantees extensive benefits for the
students and the community that Paloma Valley High School will serve.
