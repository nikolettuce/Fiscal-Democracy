FULL TEXT OF MEASURE J RESOLUTION NO. 06-03 SPRINGFIELD MEADOWS COMMUNITY SERVICES DISTRICT  WHEREAS, the Springfield Meadows Community Services District maintains all roads, culverts, lighting, bridges and parks within the District, and  WHEREAS, the Financial Plan prepared for William Lyon Homes, Inc and the Springfield Meadows CSD Board of Directors by Economic and Planning Systems, Inc. recommended a per parcel annual assessment of $350, and  WHEREAS, the current annual assessment per parcel within the District is $200, and  WHEREAS, the Board of Directors held a meeting of the Springfield Meadows Community Services District on July 10, 2006 and determined that failure to raise annual assessments to $350 per parcel would be detrimental to the financial well-being of the District.  NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, as follows:  The Board of Directors of the Springfield Meadows Community Services District should cause to have placed on the November 2006 ballot the following Measure:  "Shall the Springfield Meadows Community Services District be authorized to tax each parcel within the District an additional $150 per year to cover the costs of maintaining and improving community infrastructure and for other lawful purposes of the District?" Yes or No	


IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE J  This measure, if approved by 2/3 of the voters voting on the measure, would authorize a special tax on each parcel of real property within the boundaries of the Springfield Meadows Community Services District (“District”). The proceeds from the special tax can be used to cover the costs of maintaining and improving community infrastructure and for any other lawful purposes of the District.  This special tax would be in the amount of $150 per annum per parcel of land, and would be in addition to any existing taxes and benefit assessments.  The special tax will be listed as a separate item on the county property tax bill for each parcel of land, and will be collected in the same way as the general property tax. All laws applicable to the levy, collection, and enforcement of county property taxes, including provisions for penalties and procedure for sale of the property in case of delinquency, shall also apply to the special tax. State law requires the District to prepare an annual report to determine the amount of special tax funds collected and expended, and to describe the status of any project required or authorized to be funded by the special tax.  This measure requires an affirmative vote of 2/3 or more of all voters voting on the measure in order to pass.  A "YES" vote is a vote to authorize the special tax provided in the measure.  A "NO" vote is a vote against the special tax provided in the measure.  LOUIS B. GREEN County Counsel


ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE J  A "YES" vote on Measure "J" will protect the short and long term viability of the Springfield Meadows Community Services District by providing the necessary funding to maintain and improve the community infrastructure. In addition to covering the costs of routine maintenance and funding long term road maintenance and repair, a YES vote will help provide funding for community beautification projects which will enhance and protect our property values! Beautiful green parks, recreational facilities, improved safety, improved aesthetics, walking trails, are all within the vision of possibilities for our District if you vote "YES" on Measure "J".  Springfield Meadows, Shadow Hills and Stonebriar are wonderful neighborhoods! The current annual assessment of $200.00 goes to maintain our roads, culverts, lighting, parks and open space and has not been increased since 1987 - nearly 20 years! The current assessment is inadequate for the management of our community assets. The Financial Plan prepared for William Lyon Homes recommended the annual assessment be increased to $350 more than three years ago to help keep pace with costs and inflation. The current Board of Directors voted unanimously in favor of this increase to protect the district's financial well-being. We hope you will go to the polls on November 7th and do the same.  Please join us in voting "YES" on Measure "J" and in making our neighborhoods the best kept secret in El Dorado Hills!  Robert W. Hollis, SMCSD President  Rusty Everett, SMCSD Director  Jeff Jones, SMCSD Director  Brodie Stephens, Shadow Hills Architectural Control Committee Don Stone, SMCSD General Manager
