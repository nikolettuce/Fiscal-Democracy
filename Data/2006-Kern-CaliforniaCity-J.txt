ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF
MEASUREJ
CITY OF CALIFORNIA CITY

In 1998 the voters of California City approved a Special Parcel Tax of $75 a year
for 3 years. That Tax was dedicated to helping maintain the services of the Police
and Fire Departments, the maintenance of our streets, to reinstate the Park and
Recreation Department, and help fund the Water Treatment Facility upgrades.
The Citizens Advisory Committee oversees the collection and distribution of
these funds. The Committee provides a semiannual report at an open City Coun-
cil Meeting and in the local newspapers. The Voters continued the Tax twice. We
are in the last year of the current 3 year tax. The $75 amount is not keeping up with
the increasing costs of these services. General Fund Revenues alone will not be
able to maintain the current level of support and services you have requested and
come to expect. You, the community, have stated to the City Council and the Spe-
cial Tax Committee you want these services continued. To be able to continue
these services with the increased equipment and workforce needed as our City
grows through the future, the City Council has called for an increase in the Special
Parcel Tax from $75 to $105 a year. Replies to the Special Tax Committee survey
indicated your support for an increase. The Special Parcel Tax is the only tax you
pay that comes directly to our Community without deductions by the State or
County Government or Agencies. To enable the City to manage our City Finances
in alignment with current Financial Practices the City Council has increased the
duration for the continued Special Parcel Tax to 5 years. The City Council, Special
Parcel Tax Committee and Leaders of Our Community ask for Your Support on
Election Day in Voting FOR the Continuance of the Special Parcel Tax.

ARGUMENT AGAINST
MEASUREJ
CITY OF CALIFORNIA CITY

This is a tax on the mere ownership of real-property and the tax burden has no fjp,
lationship to the value of the property.	.

“But the fairness of one’s allocable share of the total property tax burden can only
be meaningfully evaluated by comparison with the share of others similarly situ-
ated relative to their property holdings.” (Allegheny)

The tax may be in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution
as well as Article XII! Section 1 of the California Constitution.

Most of the tax burden will be on absentee land owners that are not allowed to ■
vote on the tax measure.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST

CITY OF CALIFORNIA CITY

The Parcel Tax is unfair. The current 3 year Parcel Tax is on Petition to the U.S.
Supreme Court as case no. 05-1488 as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause
of the United States Constitution.

Here is an example using approximate numbers that are based on the figures for
California City from the Kern Co. Assessor’s 2004-2005 Annual Report:

Parcels 51,940 Value $616,360,717

50,000 parcels x $105 per parcel $5,250,000 tax per year

$5,250,000 tax/ $616,000,000 value = .0085 or .85%

If the tax burden was relative to the assessed value of parcels then homes, busi-
ness property and parcels of vacant land would be taxed an additional .85%. For a
home or any other parcel for each $1,000 of assessed value this would be an in-
crease of $8.50. For each $100,000 of assessed value that would be an increase
of $850 per year.

If the flat rate Parcel Tax is held Unconstitutional then additional taxes on the
mere ownership of real property may be required to be the same percentage of
assessed value and all parcels would be taxed in proportion to the assessed
value of the owners property holdings.

The registered voters should pay their fair share of the tax burden rather than be
subsidized by absentee land owners that are not allowed to vote.

The Parcel Tax is unfair and may be found Unconstitutional.

Vote NO on the tax.

s/George W. Yelding

REB-FAV-J

Opponents of the Special Tax want you to think it’s a violation of the current laws, i
The California State Supreme Court has ruled that this is not true. The Special
Taxes you will approve is in accordance with California State Laws governing
such taxes. The inference to the United States Constitution is also incorrect. All
registered voters in California City may do so. Many of our residents own property
in other Cities, Counties, States and Countries. They do not have a vote on those
local issues, projects or taxes. Why would you give the right to determine the level I
of City Services to someone living in Japan, China or the Middle East? They have ;
no interest In the quality of YOUR LIFE. The value of their property is based on im-
provements in our City. They make money as we grow and the taxes they pay .
help the City grow, and improves their property values.

The Special Tax is voted in by YOU, the voting members of our community, by a
two-thirds majority.

The State Supreme Court declared that Special Taxes are applied by parcel as
stipulated by State Law and not on the value of the property.

Of all the Taxes we pay, Special Taxes are the only ones where ALL the money
comes back to the community. YOUR input to the Special Tax Committees are i
what determine where the money is used.

Your City Council is in 100% support of the Special Tax.

VOTE YES FOR MEASURE J.
