IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
CITY OF GREENFIELD
MEASUREJ

(Cal. Elections Code § 9280)

The City Council of the City of Greenfield has placed Measure
J on the November 2,2004 ballot to ask voters to consider increasing
the existing Utility Users Tax (“UUT") by three percent (3%). Measure
J would only become effective if approved by a majority of voters
casting a vote on the Measure at the November 2, 2004 election.

The City of Greenfield Municipal Code Chapter 13.50 currently
imposes a tax at the rate of three percent (3%) of the charges for
intrastate telephone, electrical, gas and cable television services
upon every person in the City of Greenfield using intrastate telephone,
electric, gas and cable television service. The revenue is used for
General Fund purposes, including police, park and recreation
services.

If approved by a majority of voters, this measure will amend
Chapter 13.50 of the Greenfield Municipal Code to increase the tax
on all of the above utilities to a rate not to exceed six percent (6%)
effective January 1, 2005 and would include an amendment making
the tax applicable to all utilities provided to residents of the City of
Greenfield.

Currently, the tax generates about $176,000 annually. This
amount is approximately 6% of the City’s general fund. These funds
are used to provide general municipal services such as police and
public works services.

By placing Measure J on the ballot, the City complies with Article
XIIIC of the California Constitution (adopted by Proposition 218),
which requires the voters to approve an amended ordinance which
affects amount of the tax, the manner of collection, and other related
matters. A copy of the proposed ordinance is printed in the sample
ballot.

DATED: August 16, 2004

s/ Kimberly A. Johnson, City Attorney
City of Greenfield
The above statement is an impartial analysis of MEASURE J.
If you desire a copy of the measure, please call the City Clerk
at 674-5591 and a copy will be mailed at no cost to you.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE J
UTILITY USER TAX INITIATIVE

Your vote will determine whether the City’s Utility Users Tax should
be increased from the current level of 3% to 6% in order to provide
additional services needed. This increase will generate approximately
$176,500 in additional General Fund revenue.

The Utility Users Tax was instituted in 1992. The purpose for its
establishment by the City Council at that time was for public safety
services.

The Utility Users Tax is one of the few revenue sources for which
local government has exclusive control over collection and use. Utility
Users Tax is the only real fiscal tool for meeting the budgetary needs
of public agencies, as other forms of taxation are unavailable or
impractical. Although vehicle license, sales and property taxes are
local revenues, the State or County administers, sets the rate for
and controls the allocation amongst local agencies for these taxes.

Simply put, the Utility Users Tax is a consistent, reliable, locally
controlled source of revenue which provides for police services as
it was intended in 1992 and, in addition, the proposed increase will
provide for much needed recreational and other city services. Each
year since 1992-93, the State has taken billions of cities’, counties’
and local districts’ property tax revenues, shifting these revenues to
local schools, thereby reducing the cost to the state general fund
for school funding. On average, this loss amounts to 25% of city
property tax revenue. In addition, since year 2002-03, the City’s
vehicle license fee revenue was reduced 38%, approximately
$268,000 a year.

Vote "YES" on Measure J to increase the Utility Users Tax
to 6%. Participate in increasing the level of police, recreation,
and other City services.

state of similar amounts.

PROTECCION DE LAS RECAUDACIONES DE
LOS GOBIERNOS LOCALES. Garantiza que las
recaudaciones locales provenientes de los
impuestos sobre la propiedad y las ventas
permanezcan en los gobiernos locales,
salvaguardando por lo tanto el financiamiento de la
seguridad publics, la salud, las bibliotecas, los
parques y otros servicios locales. Las disposiciones
solo pueden ser suspendidas si el gobernador
declare necesidad fiscal y las dos terceras partes de
la Legislature estan de acuerdo. impacto fiscal:
Mayores recaudaciones de los gobiernos locales
que las que hubiera sido el caso de lo contrario,
posiblemente de miles de millones de dolares
anuales a lo largo del tiempo. Todos esos impactos
sobre las recaudaciones locales
resultarian en una reduccion de los
recursos del estado en cantidades
similares.
