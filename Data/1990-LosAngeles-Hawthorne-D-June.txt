ARGUMENT IH FAVOR OF PROPOSITION D

You now have the ability to take a united stand against narcotics, gangs, graffiti
and other crimes in our city by voting YES for this proposition.

While the population of Hawthorne and the immediate area has increased
dramatically, the number of police officers has not. As a result, Hawthorne has
fallen into the predicament of having the fewest number of officers per 1000
population of any full-service city in the South Bay and one of the highest
increases in reported crimes.

Criminals are aware of our predicament and many have taken advantage of it
and relocated their operations here.

This proposition will allow your police department to add 30 sworn officers
to the patrol division for as little as one dollar and change per household per
week.

We have turned to you and your family for help because you are the reason
Hawthorne is the City of Good Neighbors and we know you care.

Support law enforcement and help take a united stand against crime in
Hawthorne. Vote YES on this proposition.

........... ARGUMENT AGAINST PROPOSITION D

VOTE NO (W THIS raOP^TION. This misleading^neasure will impose
a completely unnecessary tax upon practically every residence and business in
Hawthorne. That’s not right. Worse, for no apparent reason, it will often
unfairly extract the most from those who have the least. That’s not right either!

This Proposition is supposed to raise money for additional police service, and
no one is opposed to more police. However, this new tax isn’t needed to do
it, and if a new tax isn’t necessary, it shouldn’t be levied. Enough is enough!

Hawthorne could save more than enough to finance the increased police budget
by improving its own efficiency, as has been repeatedly recommended to
Hawthorne City Council members. This Proposition asks you to ignore
economy again in favor of higher taxes. That doesn’t make sense!

Proposition 13 was specifically enacted to block tax increases such as this one.
Regretable, the City Council refuses to bring common business sense into City
operations. Instead of cutting the fat, it spends and spends and asks you to pay
higher taxes. That’s wrong!

This Proposition should also be defeated because it is unfair and completely
arbitrary. The amount of the proposed tax is totally unrelated to lot size or even
valuation. A vacant lot could be assessed a higher tax than the million dollar
building next door.

Corner businesses can look forward to a tax at least double their next door
neighbors.

If you rent an apartment your unit will be taxed, higher than if it were a
condominium or even a house. If you can’t afford to own, this Proposition will
penalize you. That’s not fair!

This Proposition is unnecessary, expensive and unfair. VOTE NO ON THIS
PROPOSITION!
