IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
CITY OF PACIFIC GROVE TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY
TAX INCREASE MEASURE D

Measure D, if approved by two-thirds of the voters voting on the measure,
would permit the City of Pacific Grove to increase its transient occupancy
tax from the present rate of 10% to a new rate of 11 %. The transient
occupancy tax is a tax on the rent paid for the privilege of occupying a
room or rooms in a hotel, motei or other similar type lodging for a period
of 30 days or less. If the measure is approved, the increase in the transient
occupancy tax would be authorized for a period not to exceed ten years,
beginning the first calendar year after approval by the voters. The measure
requires that the money collected as a result of the additional tax of 1 %
of the rent charged be used solely to assist in financing the acquisition and
restoration of ail or any part of the shoreline area known as Rocky Shores,
for the purpose of preserving the Rocky Shores area as public open space.
The measure provides that the City Council may utilize any appropriate fi-
nancing method to fund the acquisition of Rocky Shores, provided that the
amount financed shall not exceed the capability of the additional one percent
of transient occupancy tax to fund the payment of principal, interest and
administrative costs of the amount financed. If the Rocky Shores property
becomes owned entirely by a public entity, if the City of Pacific Grove owes
no debt in connection with the acquisition and if in the judgment of the
City Council of the City of Pacific Grove the restoration of the Rocky Shores
area is sufficient for use as a public open space, then the City Council is
required to rescind the additional 1 % transient occupancy tax even if the
ten year period authorized by the measure has not ended.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE D

Rocky Shores is the ONLY piece of Pacific Grove's magnificent si-
endangered by development. The habitat for several rare and enda
species, it is part of one of the most breathtaking scenic views in Cal
A "YES" vote on Measure D will help raise funds to acquire and pi
it as open space, in accord with our city's Local Coastal Program,
Measure D IS NOT A TAX ON PACIFIC GROVE RESIDENTS OR
NESSES. The Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) is paid ENTIRELY by
ISTS who come to enjoy our shoreline and stay in local motels anc
It will allow the city to increase the TOT by no more than 1 % - frc
present 10% to 11% - for no more than ten years. An average
family would pay only about $1.00 more per night -- about the pric
cup of coffee,

Funds raised would be used EXCLUSIVELY to acquire and preserve
Shores property, if and when it becomes available for purchase.
Pacific Grove residents traditionally carry the burden of preserving ou
open spaces, With Measure D, tourists would also make a small contri
to saving our shoreline.

Measure D IS FISCALLY SOUND. The increase in the TOT woul
principal, interest and cost of any obligation assumed by the city t<
acquire Rocky Shores. City services WOULD NOT BE AFFECTED.
Measure D has been placed on the ballot by an initiative that was;
by more than 1500 Pacific Grove voters. The initiative was endors
local chapters of environmental organizations.

NO ARGUMENT AGAINST THIS MEASURE
WAS SUBMITTED

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE C

Measure D proponents want you to believe that a vote for their me
is a vote FOR the environment and that a vote against is a vote AG/
the environment. IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE, AND PACIFIC GROVE VO
KNOW IT! They wisely defeated this measure last year.

Rocky Shores is magnificent - MEASURE D ISN'T! Take the time to

it.

Measure D doesn't say what happens to our tax dollars if the city
buy the lots. Since the lots are NOT FOR SALE, shouldn’t that have
considered? Millions of dollars will just sit in a fund, IS THAT FISC,
RESPONSIBLE?

If other open space opportunities become available, Measure D funds <
NOT be used. IS THAT ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND?

Proponents tel! us that tourists will pay this tax. They say there is no
to Pacific Grove residents. DON’T BE FOOLED! At this writing, a MAS
BUDGET DEFICIT is projected! WHO'S GOING TO PAY FOR THAT?
Measure D gives the city council a BLANK CHECK! It places NO L
on what the city could pay for Rocky Shores!

Pacific Grove must learn to live within its means. How can we be CUT
LIBRARY HOURS, and facing a BUDGET DEFICIT and still afford multi-m
dollar real estate?

Other public agencies just bought the four Rocky Shores lots that •
for sale. THEY DID IT WITHOUT MEASURE D. if more lots become avail;
let them do it again - THEY ALREADY HAVE OUR TAX DOLLARS!
VOTE NO ON MEASURE D!
