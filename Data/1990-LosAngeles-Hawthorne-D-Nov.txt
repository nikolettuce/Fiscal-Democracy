ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION D

Crime remains the dominant issue facing our City. We continue to see acts
of violence and loss of property rise at an alarming rate. For 1990, crime is
up 14% compared to 1989. As you will remember, crime for 1989 rose 20%
over 1988.

As a voter, you should be aware that violent drug and gang activity are
continuing to spiral upward, in fact, probably in your neighborhood. The Police
Department continues to handle an extraordinary volume of calls for service
at a rate that far surpasses our neighboring communities.

This tax has been structured after a long series of public hearings that included
input from a variety of community members. It will raise approximately $2.5
million dollars per year. It is a tax that you helped design.

If passed by you the voters, these tax monies must go solely to the Police
Department and pay for 35 more police officers to impact crime. We have to
put more police on the street and this proposition will do just that.

This is a fair and reasonable tax. For only 15 cents per day you can make an
impact and help to reverse this violent and sometimes deadly spree of crime
in the City of Good Neighbors.

Why does the Hawthorne City Council keep raising fees and consider raising
taxes? They have not listened to recommendations that have been presented
to them in the last three years on other ways to put extra officers on our streets,
possibly without an extra tax or fee and have a savings to help balance our
budget.

This proposition while identifying the revenue for additional officers does not
identify when we will see these officers on the street or any hidden costs, such
as additional liability insurance and increased personnel in the city attorney’s
office. Will the existing police facility be large enough to handle these
additional officers? If not, will we have to have more taxes and fees to make
it adequate? Are there more hidden costs? Think about it!

This property tax not only makes it unattractive for new businesses to locate
here, it also places an additional burden on the ones we are still lucky enough
to have. As we all know we have lost some of our prominent employers and
tax base in the last three years.

The city council refuses to consider anything but a tax to hire additional officers
and has not provided the taxpayers with the total cost that is required to hire
those officers.

Please consider all hidden costs not identified in this proposition and vote NO.
