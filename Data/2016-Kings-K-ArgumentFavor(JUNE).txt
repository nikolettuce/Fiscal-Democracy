Statement in Favor of Measure K

Vote YES on Measure K. Measure K will raise money for local law enforcement and fire departments
by imposing a X cent transactions and use tax in Kings County. Measure K is expected to permanently
generate approximately $4,000,000 annually for all local police. Sheriff, and fire operations, while
costing shoppers only .25 for every $100 spent.

Measure K will NOT raise your taxes beyond what you currently pay at the cash register. The tax will
not go into effect unless and until the % cent Proposition 30 sales tax expires on January 1,2017. Also,
all of the money will stay local under a revenue sharing agreement between Kings County and the
county's four cities. Not one cent will go to Sacramento.

Funding for public safety is desperately needed in Kings County. With over 3,500 property crimes per
year and a violent crime rate well above the statewide average, particularly for aggravated assaults.
Kings County needs more police officers and Sheriffs deputies on patrol in our communities.
Emergency response times can be reduced with adequate staffing at strategically located fire stations;
yet four stations in Kings County operate as one-person stations, and communities cannot build
stations needed to accommodate growth without funding for staff.

Measure K includes multiple safeguards. By law, all of the money generated by Measure K must be
spent for public safety purposes, including personnel, new and rehabilitated police and fire stations,
and frontline police and fire equipment. Additionally, the County's Auditor will be required to report
annually on the use of Measure K revenues by the County and its cities. These reports will be
submitted to a citizens' oversight committee for review and comment.
