CITY OF SAN LEANDRO MEASURE

CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

(TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX INCREASE)

The San Leandro City Council, by a unanimous vote, placed Measure_on the November ballot

to request that voters adopt an ordinance that would increase the transient occupancy tax (TOT)
from 10% to 14%.

The transient occupancy tax is imposed on persons staying in or using hotels, motels, inns, or
other temporary lodging, and the associated amenities, for periods of 30 days or less. All such
places of lodging in the City must collect the tax from users and remit the tax to the City.
Currently, the San Leandro Municipal Code imposes a transient occupancy tax rate of 10% of the
room rental rate. Other cities in the region, such as Oakland and San Francisco, have TOT rates
of 14%.

If Measure____is passed by the voters, it would increase the City’s TOT to 14%. The tax would

be a general tax that the City estimates could generate approximately $200,000 in revenue the
proceeds of which could be used for any legal municipal purpose. The tax would be ongoing.
California Constitution, Article XIII(C), Section 2(b) requires that an increase to a general tax
must be approved by a majority vote of the electorate.

A “yes” vote is a vote to adopt the ordinance allowing the City to increase the transient
occupancy tax imposed upon users of hotels, motels, inns or other temporary lodging, and all of
the associated amenities, within the City from 10% to 14%.

A “no” vote is a vote against adopting the ordinance.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure_. If you desire a copy of the

ordinance, please call the City Clerk’s office at 510-577-3367, and a copy will be mailed at no
cost to you.

DATED: August 2, 2016

Richard D. Pio Roda, City Attorney
City of San Leandro, California

Argument in Favor of Measure Z - TOT (hotel tax]

Vote YES on Z—San Leandro’s hotel tax measure. Protect property values and quality community services,
WITHOUT taxing San Leandro’s residents or property owners.

•	YES on X, Y and Z provides shelters for abused women and children

•	YES on X, Y and Z fixes potholes and repairs city streets

•	YES on X, Y and Z improves 911 emergency response times and provides a seismically safe police
operations center

•	YES on X, Y and Z enhances safety net programs for homeless and at-risk adults and children

•	YES on X, Y and Z updates the police operations center and technology so San Leandro Police
Department's crime prevention efforts will be more effective

•	YES on X, Y and Z attracts new businesses and create jobs in San Leandro

•	YES on X, Y and Z provides essential upgrades to our Library, including space for children's story
times, a homework center, public access computers and free wi-fi at Mulford-Marina Branch

Sacramento politicians take $12,000,000 annually from San Leandro. Funding generated by Measures X, Y
and Z replaces this funding, giving San Leandro taxpayers LOCAL control over LOCAL funds for LOCAL
needs.

NO funds can be taken by Sacramento politicians.

NO money raised from Measures X, Y and Z will be used for administrator salaries.

YES on X, Y and Z are fiscally accountable. All three measures require independent citizen oversight,
mandatory financial audits, and yearly reports to the community to ensure that money is spent as promised.

Voting YES on X, Y and Z protects San Leandro property values by maintaining quality services, parks, open
space and safe neighborhoods, all WITHOUT RAISING YOUR TAXES.

Join a unanimous City Council and San Leandro’s police officers, firefighters, teachers, neighborhood
community leaders and business leaders in voting YES on X, Y and Z!

Rebuttal to Argument in Favor of Measure_______(Transient Occupancy Tax)

There are only four hotels in San Leandro that will be subject to the new 14% Transient
Occupancy Tax: the Marina Inn, the Budget Inn, the Nimitz Motel and the Hilton Garden Inn.
The supporters claim the city will collect $200,000 more every year from these four struggling
businesses if this tax hike is approved.

That amount will hardly cover the annual salary of just one single San Leandro police
officer. Please note that San Leandro employs 147 such peace officers, 25 of whom are among
the highest paid city employees, making over $130,000 per year (not including overtime).

The new minimum wage law, on top of a 40% hotel tax increase, will likely force one or
more of these hospitality businesses to lay off some of their lowest-paid workers — their
housekeepers — the very people the new minimum wage was supposed to help!

The City Council didn’t even draft these arguments themselves, but copied them almost
word-for-word from the same argument they used to promote Measure HH two years ago. And
that argument was copied almost word-for-word from the argument they filed to support
Measure Z in 2010. Both Measure Z (2010) and Measure HH (2014) were drafted and promoted
by the same consulting firm who convinced them that Measures X, Y and Z were great ideas.

Our City Council never met a tax they couldn’t support, so they’ve now put THREE (3)
new taxes on the November ballot. For Heaven’s sake, don’t let them rob you again!

Argument against San Leandro Measure__________(Transient	Occupancy Tax)

City Leaders claim this tax doesn’t affect any San Leandro residents, since it is only paid
by customers of local hotels and short-term rentals. The proposal will raise the current transient
occupancy tax from 10% to 14%, which is certainly a disincentive for tourists to book
accommodations here. Oakland currently imposes an identical 14% tax (the highest in Alameda
County), but has much greater hotel capacity, and a major airport to support. Emeryville’s tax is
only 12% while tourists who book a hotel room anywhere in Contra Costa County pay just 10%.
Hayward’s transient occupancy tax is even lower (only 8.5%). This new tax doesn’t make San
Leandro look very competitive at all.

The “sharing economy” has launched an entirely new business model, complicating the
traditional hospitality industry with a new, radically decentralized marketplace. Uber and Lyft
disrupted the monopoly taxicab business by allowing anyone with a car to provide a valuable
service for lower rates — often undercutting even public transit fares. Similarly, websites like
AirBnB and VRBO (Vacation Rentals by Owner) allow residents to rent spare rooms, boats, and
sometimes even their entire houses to visitors without having to operate a commercial hospitality
business, like a hotel or bed and breakfast.

The “fiscal emergency” excuse used to justify the last two sales tax measures is no longer
valid. City Manager Chris Zapata reported in June that San Leandro’s financial situation is
robust and healthy, which begs the question of why all these new taxes are even necessary.

Increased competition tends to drive prices downward, but increased taxation has exactly
the opposite effect! Please vote NO on the hotel tax hike.

[Rebuttal to argument against Measure PP (Transient Occupancy)]

Why should the out-of-towners who visit San Leandro and use our 911, streets, parks and open space be given a
free ride from contributing their fair share to these services? They shouldn’t!

FACT: Voting YES on PP simply maintains the services you rely on, without raising your taxes.

FACT: Measure PP is NOT a tax on your home or property. For years, San Leandro hotel/lodging guests
have paid a “transient occupancy tax” on hotel rooms. This type of tax is only paid by hotel or lodging guests
when they spend the night locally, nearly all of whom are visitors or travelers stopping in San Leandro to shop
or attend our events. San Leandro residents and property owners are NOT taxed.

FACT: By increasing hotel room costs slightly, YES on PP ensures that hotel guests and visitors to San
Leandro pay their fair share for the local services they use. By law, Measure PP provides local funding
that cannot be taken by Sacramento, ensuring Local Control. Sacramento politicians can’t touch this money!

The revenue generated by voting YES on PP and Measures NN & OO will be used exclusively for maintaining
vital San Leandro services such as: providing shelter for abused women/children; fixing potholes and repairing
city streets; improving 911 emergency response times; enhancing safety net programs for homeless and at-risk
adults & children; and providing essential improvements to the San Leandro Library.

Join a unanimous Mayor and City Council and San Leandrans from every neighborhood: Vote LOCAL by voting
YES on PP, NN, and OO!

Attachment 1

An ORDINANCE of the City of San Leandro Amending Title 2, Chapter 2-10 of the
San Leandro Municipal Code Relating to Transient Occupancy Tax

Now, therefore, the City Council of the City of San Leandro does ordain as follows:

SECTION 1. Amendments. Section 2-10-110 is hereby amended to read as follows,
with deletions in strikethrough and additions in underlined text:

For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, including but not limited to any
inn, motel, or time-share facilities, each transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in the
amount of ten-fourteen (40-14) percent of the rent charged by the operator. Such tax
constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the City which is extinguished only by
payment to the operator or to the City. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of
the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate
share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon
the transient’s ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not
paid to the operator of the hotel, the Finance Director may require that such tax be paid
directly to the Finance Director.

SECTION 3: Severability. If any section, subsection, subdivision, paragraph,
sentence, clause or phrase of this Ordinance, or its application to any person or
circumstance, is for any reason held to be invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or
unenforceability shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining sections,
subsections, subdivisions, paragraphs, sentences, clauses or phrases of this
Ordinance, or its application to any other person or circumstance. The City Council of
the City of San Leandro hereby declares that it would have adopted each section,
subsection, subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase hereof, irrespective of
the fact that any one or more other sections, subsections, subdivisions, paragraphs,
sentences, clauses or phrases hereof is declared invalid or unenforceable.

SECTION 4: Publication and Effective Date. This Ordinance shall take effect
immediately after approval of the ballot measure related hereto.
