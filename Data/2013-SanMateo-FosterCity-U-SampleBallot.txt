City’s business license tax effective January 1, 2014?

Impartial Analysis of Measure U	Argument in Favor of Measure	U

Title 5 of the Foster City Municipal Code, Chapters 5.04-5.40,
Business Licenses Generally, in effect since 1972, requires
businesses operating within Foster City to obtain a business
license from the City. Since its adoption in 1972, this ordinance
has never been amended.

If approved by a majority of voters, this measure would amend
Title 5, Chapters 5.04 to 5.40 of the Foster City Municipal Code.
A copy of the proposed ordinance is available at the City’s website
at www.fostercity.org. Currently the cost of a business license
tax is calculated based on a business’s annual gross receipts at an
amount equal to $0.75 per $1,000 of gross receipts. If this ballot
measure is approved, the rate would remain the same. However,
the minimum cost of a business license would increase according
to the following table:

Effective Date	General  Contractor	Specialty  Contractor	Solicitor	AUOther  Businesses
Current Rate	$50	$25	$25	$25
January 1,2014	$100	$50	$50	$50
January 1,2015	$150	$75	$75	$75
January 1,2016 and thereafter	$200	$100	$100	$100

In addition, the amount of gross receipts limit upon which the business
license is computed would increase according to the following table:

Effective Date	Gross Receipts Limit	Calculated Maximum Tax Amount
Current Rate	$5,OOO,O00	$3,750
January 1, 2014	$10,000,000	$7,500
January 1, 2015	$20,000,000	$15,000
January 1, 2016	$30,000,000	$22,500

Starting on January 1, 2017, and every year thereafter, the gross
receipts limit would be adjusted based upon the change from
October to October in the Consumer Price Index for the San
Francisco / Oakland / San Jose area (Urban Consumers Rate),
rounded to the nearest $10,000.

Businesses with multiple corporate entities operating from the
same location in the City would be required to obtain business
licenses for their three (3) entities with the largest gross receipts.

The ordinance would also clarify various provisions relating to the
imposition, administration and issuance of business licenses. The
full text of the ordinance should be consulted for further specifics
regarding these matters.

The revenue from business licenses is placed in the City’s general
fund. Money from this fund supports general City services and
functions, including: police, fire, parks and recreation, and repair
and maintenance of essential infrastructure such as the levee,
lagoons, and streets.

A “yes” vote on this measure is a vote to approve and authorize
the changes in Title 5, Chapters 5.04 to 5.40 of the Foster City
Municipal Code as described above. This measure constitutes a
general tax which can be approved by a simple majority vote.

A “no” vote on this measure is a vote to maintain the provisions
of the existing business license ordinance as identified in Title 5,
Chapters 5.04 to 5.40 of the Foster City Municipal Code.

Foster City is one of the best places on the Peninsula to live, work
and play, with fantastic parks and recreational amenities, high
quality and responsive police and fire departments, and well-
maintained roads, levees and lagoons.

To maintain this quality of life, the City has cut non-essential
services, shared services with other communities, frozen employee
salaries and reduced pension benefits. And yet a budget deficit
looms on the horizon.

The City’s business license tax has not changed since 1972, even
while the cost of providing services has increased. Moreover,
the types of businesses in Foster City and how they operate has
changed significantly.

In concert with the business community and the Chamber of
Commerce, we can bring the business license tax into the 21st
Century by increasing the minimum tax amount and the maximum
tax amount over a 3 year period, then making sure the tax keeps
up with the times by allowing the maximum tax amount to change
with inflation. The Chamber of Commerce “believes the proposed
model is reasonable.”

Your YES vote will allow Foster City to maintain quality services
enjoyed by all that live, work and play in our community.
