Kathy and I discovered Del Mar in 1990 and decided to retire here because of the special values
of the community. We quickly learned that the keys to the quality of Del Mar life are extensive
citizen involvement and the Community Plan.

Accordingly, my recent and current civic service, includes: Chair, City Finance Committee;
Member, City Facilities Advisory Committee; Member, City Fairgrounds Master Plan Advisory
Committee; Treasurer, Del Mar Community Connections; Treasurer, Friends of the San Dieguito
River Valley; and Board Member, Del Mar Village Association.

Del Mar is facing difficult choices as revenues are threatened at a time when action on strategic
initiatives is essential. My experience provides financial, analytical and planning skills that will be
useful during Council deliberations. Issues that I will address include: progress on key
environmental issues, including restoration of the San Dieguito Lagoon, advocacy of Del Mar's
concerns regarding the Fairground's Master Plan proposals, and sensible resolution of the tracks-
off-the-bluffs issues; prudent strategies for balancing city costs and revenues and planning for
the relocation of the fire station and other city facilities needs; and common-sense and
consensual approaches to neighborhood undergrounding efforts.

I ask for your vote on November 5th.

CITY OF DEL MAR
Proposition G

(This proposition will appear on the ballot in the following form.)

PROPG

Shall the transient occupancy tax (TOT), paid by hotel
visitors, be increased to ten and one-half percent, a rate
identical to that of the City, of San Diego?

CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

Del Mar’s 10 percent transient occupancy tax (TOT) is imposed on hotel/motel visitors and is
collected by the hotel operator. In 1988, the City’s voters approved a tax of eight percent. In 1991,
the City Council increased the tax from 8 percent to 1D percent. By the adoption of Proposition 218
in 1996, State law now requires that the tax rate increased by the City Council be approved by the
voters, or no longer be imposed.

Most of the cities in San Diego County have TOT rates of 10 percent or more.
The City of San Diego’s rate is 10 'k percent.

If this proposition is approved, the taxes of City residents will not increase.

A "yes” vote would validate the TOT increase imposed in 1991, and would increase the TOT by
one-half of one percent. The resulting 10 'k percent rate of this proposition would be the same as
that imposed by the City of San Diego.

A “no” vote would reduce the current 10 percent TOT rate to 8 percent.

This proposition requires approval by a majority of those voting.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION G

Vote Yes on Proposition G - the Hotel Visitor Tax Measure

On November 5,2002, Del Mar residents will cast an important vote concerning the tax rate paid by
hotel visitors for overnight stays in Del Mar. This tax (known as the Transient Occupancy Tax or
TOT) is currently 10% in Del Mar. Recent changes in State Law (Propositions 62 and 218) require
voters to approve any future change in the TOT otherwise the local TOT rate reverts to a lower level.

A “YES” vote on Proposition G would increase Del Mar’s TOT rate for the first time in 11 years. If
approved, Proposition G would increase the TOT rate to 10.5% - the same amount charged by
hotels in San Diego. Based on State regulations, a "No” vote on Proposition G would reduce the
TOT rate to what it was 11 years ago (8%). Reducing the TOT to 8% would mean the annual loss of
about $272,000 to Del Mar’s General Fund and would result in unavoidable reductions in important
local services - services we provide to residents and hotel visitors alike for their use of public
facilities including streets, beaches, parks, fire and police services, and for capital projects.

Failure of Proposition G would effectively make Del Mar’s hotel tax rate among the lowest in the
County!

It is a tax that is paid by visitors....plain and simple. Every dollar stays in Del Mar.

Vote "YES” on Proposition G to ensure that visitors pay their fair share of hotel taxes during their
stay in Del Mar AND to ensure the continued financial health of your community.

Please join us in voting “Yes” on Proposition G.

Argument in Favor of Proposition

Vote Yes on Proposition________-- the Hotel Visitor Tax Measure

On November 4, 2008, Del Mar residents will cast an important vote concerning
the tax rate paid by hotel visitors for overnight stays in Del Mar. This tax (known
as the Transient Occupancy Tax or “TOT”) is currently set at 10.5% in Del Mar.

A "YES” vote on Proposition______would allow for the tax to be set at a rate up to

13%. If approved, Proposition_______will allow the City to set Del Mar’s TOT at a

rate commensurate with adjacent cities. For example, an increase in the TOT
rate to 13% could allow the City to collect approximately $417,000 more annually
for the City of Del Mar’s General Fund. The General Fund pays for City services
that are provided to residents and hotel visitors alike for their use of public
facilities including streets, beaches, parks, fire and police services, and for capital
projects.

It is a tax that is paid by visitors....plain and simple. Unlike other revenue
sources, every TOT dollar collected stays in Del Mar.

Vote “YES” on Proposition______to ensure that visitors pay their fair share of city

services during their stay in Del Mar AND to ensure the continued financial health
of your community.

Please join us in voting “Yes” on Proposition_____.
