IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF THE
GROVELANO COMMUNITY SERVICES DISTRICT
SPECIAL TAX MEASURE A

November 6, 1990

The Groveland Community Services District provides fire protection and prevention services
within ts boundaries. Section 53978 of the Government Code permits the District to increase
its revenue by imposing a special tax if approved by two-thirds of the voters. By the adoption
of its Ordinance No. 2-90 on July 10,1990, the Board of Directors of the District has proposed a
special tax for fire protection and prevention for the 1991-92, 1992-93, 1993-94 and 1994-95
fiscal years. The Ordinance would also increase the appropriations limit of the District to the
level of the proceeds of the special tax if it is approved by the voters.

The special tax would be calculated by multiplying $10.00 times the number of benefit units
assigned to each land use classification subject to the special tax. The voters are referred to
Ordinance No. 2-90 for further particulars.

The revenue raised by the special tax can only be used for fire protection and prevention but
the exact manner and mode of the use of the revenue lies with the discretion of the Board of
Directors of the District. The Board of Directors could collect less than the approved special
tax.

The approved special tax would be collected in the same manner and subject to the same
penalties as are other charges and taxes collected by the Tax Collector of the County of
Tuolumne on behalf of the District.

If two-thirds of those voting on this measure vote “Yes”, the Board of Directors may levy a
special tax up to the amounts set forth in Ordinance No. 2-90. If two-thirds of those voting on
this measure do not vote "Yes”, the Board could not levy such a special tax.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR
OF MEASURE A

The Groveland Community Services District Fire Department protects the County’s secon
largest fire service area based on assessed value. The service area exceeds 9000 acres (over
14 square miles) and now contains about 2500 residential and commercial structures assessed
at over $250 million.

In 1986, the voters of the District, being concerned about the ability of the Fire Department to
respond in a timely manner with appropriate equipment, approved a special fire tax to
provide the Department with adequate funds to upgrade equipment and increase the level of
service to the community. That tax, which now accounts for 28% of the Fire Department's
budget, has allowed for significant upgrading of equipment and facilities and resulted in a
much higher level of service to the community. It is expected that this will ultimately result in
lower insurance costs to the District’s residents.

However, growth continues within the Fire Department’s service area, both in the number of
residences protected and in the number of responses by the mostly volunteer staff. In the last
four years, the number of residences and businesses protected has increased about 32
percent. More importantly, during the same period, the annual number of rescue and fire calls
has increased from 158 to 258, a 63 percent increase.

Approval of Measure A will continue the existing special fire tax for four more years at the
current rates only 20 dollars for a single family residence and no more than 60 dollars for the
type of business generally operating in the community. A small price for the benefits received.
Remember, APPROVAL of Measure A will NOT INCREASE the amount of tax you are now
paying. A vote for Measure A will only CONTINUE the existing special fire tax for 4 years at
the CURRENT RATES. This will allow the Fire Department to at least MAINTAIN the level of
service it now provides.
