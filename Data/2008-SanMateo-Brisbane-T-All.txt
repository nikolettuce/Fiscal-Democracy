“AN ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF BRISBANE
IMPOSING A SPECIAL BUSINESS LICENSE TAX
FOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS

The People of the City of Brisbane, California, hereby ordain
as follows:

§ 1:	ESTABLISHMENT	OF	CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT

SPECIAL TAX.

A new Section 5.20.015 is added to Chapter 5.20 of the Brisbane
Municipal Code, to read as follows:

5.20.015 Special Tax For Capital Improvements.

(a)	Designation of Special Tax. The special tax imposed by this
Section 5.20.015 shall be known and designated as the Capital
Improvement Tax.

(b)	Definitions of Capital Improvement and Capital
Improvement Project. As used in this Section 5.20.015, the following
terms shall have the meanings set forth below:

(1)	The term “capital improvement” means any asset having an
acquisition, construction, or installation cost of $25,000 or
more and a useful life of ten (10) years or more, as shown on
the financial records of the City.

(2)	The term “capital improvement project” means any capital
improvement financed, in whole or in part, with proceeds of
the Capital Improvement Tax.

(c)	Use of Special Tax. The proceeds of the Capital Improvement
Tax shall be utilized only for the acquisition, construction, installation,
maintenance, repair, and replacement of capital improvements owned, or to
be constructed or acquired by the City. Such proceeds shall be allocated
each fiscal year to specific capital improvement projects identified in the
City’s annual budget, subject to adjustments as may be approved from time
to time during the fiscal year by resolution of the City Council.

(d)	Accounting and Annual Report. All proceeds of the Capital
Improvement Tax shall be accounted for in a separate Capital Improvement
Tax Fund, which is hereby established as part of the City’s financial
records. Disbursements from the Capital Improvement Tax Fund shall
only be made for payment of costs related to capital improvement projects.
Not later than March 1st of each year, the City’s Director of Administrative
Services shall submit an annual report to the City Council showing the total
amount of capital improvement tax proceeds deposited to the Capital
Improvement Tax Fund during the preceding fiscal year, the nature and
amount of expenditures from said Fund during the preceding fiscal year,
and the current status of each capital improvement project being financed
by such disbursements.

(e)	Application of Special Tax. The Capital Improvement Tax
shall be imposed upon every person who is taxed under Subsection
5.20.010.A of this Chapter 5.20, having annual gross sales or gross receipts
in excess of $10,000,000. The Capital Improvement Tax shall be in
addition to any amount that may be payable by that person as a general
business license tax pursuant to Subsection 5.20.010.A of this Chapter and

shall be paid at the same time and along with payment of the general
business license tax. Persons having annual gross sales or gross receipts of
$10,000,000 or less shall be exempt from the Capital Improvement Tax.

(f)	Calculation of Capital Improvement Tax. The special tax
shall be seven and one-half cents (IV2 0) per $100 or fraction thereof of the
annual gross sales or gross receipts of every person who is subject to the
Capital Improvement Tax, reduced by the amount of general business
license tax payable by such person pursuant to Subsection 5.20.010.A of
this Chapter 5.20.

(g)	Credit For Sales Tax Received by the City. The annual
amount of Capital Improvement Tax payable by any person shall be
reduced by the amount of sales or use tax received by the City attributable
to such person during the same calendar year (the “Sales Tax Credit”). In
the event the Sales Tax Credit for any single year exceeds the Capital
Improvement Tax payable by that person for the same year, the excess Sales
Tax Credit shall be applied toward reduction of the general business license
tax payable by that person pursuant to Subsection 5.20.010.A for the same
year, but in no event shall the general business license tax be reduced below
the minimum payment of $1,300.

(h)	Limit on Total Amount of General and Special Business
License Taxes. The total amount of the general business license tax
payable by any person pursuant to Subsection 5.20.010.A plus the Capital
Improvement Tax payable by that person, as calculated in accordance with
Subsections 5.20.015(f) and 5.20.015(g), shall in no event exceed the
following limit:

(1)	$10,000	for the calendar year 2009.

(2)	$22,500	for the calendar year 2010.

(3)	$35,000	for the calendar year 2011.

(4)	For the calendar year beginning on January 1,2012, and
on January 1st of each calendar year thereafter (the
“Adjustment Date”), the limit shall be $35,000, plus an
amount obtained by multiplying $35,000 by a fraction,
the numerator of which shall be the Consumer Price
Index published by the United States Department of
Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, for Urban Wage
Earners and Clerical Workers, All Items, for the
San Francisco-Oakland Statistical Area (“CPI”)
published nearest to the Adjustment Date, and the
denominator of which shall be the CPI published
nearest to January 1, 2011.

Where the combined total of the general business license tax and the
Capital Improvement Tax exceeds the applicable limit set forth above, the
excess shall be deducted from the Capital Improvement Tax and not the
general business license tax.

(i)	Administrative Regulations. The City’s Director of
Administrative Services is authorized to adopt rules and regulations for
implementation of this Ordinance, consistent with the provisions hereof.
Any decision or determination of the Director with regard to the adoption
or application of such rules and regulations may be appealed to the City
Manager and any ruling by the City Manager may be further appealed to
the City Council. Appeals to the City Manager or the City Council shall be

made by filing a notice of appeal with the City Clerk within thirty (30) days
after the date on which the final decision or determination is made by the
Director of Administrative Services or the City Manager, as the case may
be. The notice of appeal shall set forth the grounds of the appeal and may
be accompanied by any documents the appellant intends to submit in
support of the appeal.

§2:	PARTIAL	INVALIDITY.

If any section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of this
Ordinance is for any reason held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
invalid or unconstitutional, such decision shall not affect the validity of the
remaining portions of this Ordinance.”

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE T

The City of Brisbane imposes a general business license tax which is
based upon annual gross receipts. The proceeds of the general tax can be
used for any municipal purpose. For a business having annual gross
receipts of $10,000,000 or more, the general tax would be $1,300 plus 40
per $1,000 of gross receipts over $10,000,000. Measure T will amend the
City’s business license tax to establish a special tax that would apply only
to businesses having annual gross receipts in excess of $10,000,000. The
proceeds of the special tax can be used only for the acquisition,
construction, installation, maintenance, repair or replacement of capital
improvements owned or to be constructed or acquired by the City. “Capital
improvement” is defined as any asset having an acquisition, construction,
or installation cost of $25,000 or more and a useful life of 10 years or more.

The amount of the special tax is 7V&0 per $100 of annual gross receipts
of persons subject to the tax, reduced by the amount of general business
license taxes paid by that person and further reduced by the amount of any
sales tax paid by that person during the same year. For example, a company
with gross receipts of $10,000,001 would be charged a special tax of
$7,500 ($10,000,000 - 100 = $100,000 x .075 = $7,500). The same
company would owe a general business license tax of $1,300 (based upon
the existing tax ordinance), which would be offset against the special tax.
Consequently, the total owed would be $1,300 as a general tax plus $6,200
($7,500 less $1,300) as a special tax, for a combined total of $7,500. If that
same company also paid $5,000 in sales tax, such amount would be applied
as a direct credit against the special tax, reducing total business tax liability
to $2,500. In no event would the credits for sales taxes reduce the general
business license tax below the existing minimum payment of $1,300.

The combined total of the general business license tax and the special
capital improvement tax cannot exceed $10,000 for the calendar year 2009,
$22,500 for the calendar year 2010, and $35,000 for the calendar year
2011. Thereafter, the limit of $35,000 is subject to annual adjustment based
upon the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index. Consequently,
a business having gross receipts in excess of $10,000,000 would never pay
less than $1,300 or more than the specified limit on the combined total of
general and special business license taxes during any single tax year.

Because it is a special tax that may only be used for the purpose of
financing capital improvement projects, Measure T requires a two-thirds
vote for passage. A “Yes” vote is a vote in favor of the special tax and a
“No” vote is a vote against the special tax.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE T

Brisbane’s business license fees are currently among the lowest in
San Mateo County, having not changed since 1977. The result is a growing
inequity between fees paid and the cost of services provided.

Measure T is a fair and needed change. The Measure will establish a
special tax that can only be used for capital projects. Proposition 218
requires a 2/3 vote to pass any special tax.

•	There will be no impact to nearly 95% of businesses.

•	The business license tax rate was last changed over 30 years ago.

•	The change in business license fees will be phased in over three
years to give these large businesses time to budget for the change.
When Measure T is fully implemented by 2011, it will generate
approximately $450,000 annually which can only be used for
capital projects, such as sewer, water, storm drain improvements or
a new library building.

•	Approval of Measure T will adjust the business license fee of only
a small group of the largest businesses in the City. Only businesses
which generate over $10,000,000 in annual gross receipts will be
subject to the special tax. All other businesses are exempt.

•	The new rate would be 7.50 per $100.00 of total sales. Sales tax
revenue received by the City from a business would be subtracted
from that business’ license tax.

•	Businesses impacted by this special tax currently contribute less
than 1% to the cost of City services through the Business License,
while the top 20 sales tax contributors pay for over 25% of our
services.

All business license revenues stay in Brisbane and will be used to preserve
and improve the quality of life enjoyed by the residents and businesses of
our City. Join us in voting YES on MEASURE T
