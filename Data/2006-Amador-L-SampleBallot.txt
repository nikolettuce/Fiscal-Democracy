<impartial> IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL
AMADOR COUNTY MEASURE L

As required by law, I have prepared the following impartial analysis
of Measure L.

Measure L is on the ballot in each city and throughout the
unincorporated area of Amador County. If adopted as a special tax
by two thirds of the voters voting thereon, the Measure will establish
a 1/4 cent retail transaction and use tax (a “sales tax”) in order to
fund fire protection and emergency response services in accordance
with the expenditure plan set forth in Ordinance 1650 adopted by
the Board of Supervisors. The tax imposed by this Ordinance will
be applicable in the incorporated and unincorporated territory of the
County.

According to the Ordinance, the proceeds of the tax will be spent
for the purpose of establishing a Countywide fire protection and
emergency medical services (EMS) response system that supports
the volunteer base of existing fire districts and agencies by providing
funds for the following activities:

A.	The payment of salaries, benefits and related costs for full-
time fire fighter-EMS personnel to, at a minimum, staff fire stations
during the period Monday through Friday, 8-5, in the following regions:

■	Mountain Station—Pine Grove, Pioneer, Buckhorn, Lockwood

■	Cosumnes Station—Plymouth, Willow Springs, Shenandoah
Valley, Fiddletown, River Pines

■	Valley Station—lone, Jackson Valley, Camanche

■	Central Station—Jackson, Martell, Sutter Creek

B.	The support, maintenance and enhancement of existing fire
protection-EMS district and agency volunteers by funding volunteer
insurance, training and incentive programs.

C.	The provision of oversight and administrative support for paid
staff positions.

The Amador Fire Protection Authority (AFPA) or, if AFPA ceases
to exist, a successor entity assuming the purpose and functions of
AFPA shall review annually the amount of tax collected, proposed
annual budgets and implementation strategies and make
recommendations to the Board of Supervisors regarding expenditures
pursuant to this Expenditure Plan. The Board of Supervisors will
budget for the expenditure of the tax proceeds.

This special tax will be permanent. It will be collected until it
is repealed by the voters. <impartialend>

<fiscal> FISCAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY AUDITOR-CONTROLLER
AMADOR COUNTY MEASURE L

<favor> ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE L

Measure L will help save lives and keep families safe.

Amador County relies largely on volunteer firefighters to fight
fires and respond to emergencies. Measure L will provide necessary
funding for paid fire/emergency medical personnel to improve these
emergency services.

Measure L will allow, at a minimum, paid staffing five days per
week in four existing fire stations across our county. These
emergency responders will help our volunteer firefighters.

Last year, our dedicated volunteers responded to over 3,500
calls for help. It has become increasingly difficult for these volunteers
to sacrifice time away from their job and families to help out
community. Our volunteer firefighters need our help.

That's why we need Measure L.

Measure L will be paid for through a % cent increase in our local
sales tax to enable our county to support our volunteers with pair
firefighters. For every ten dollars spent on goods in Amador County
less than 3 pennies will be spent to pay for fire protection - a small
price to pay to keep our families safe.

Vote Yes on Measure L to insure that the many visitors and
tourists to Amador pay a share in providing fire and emergency
medical services in the County.

The challenge we face as a community is what to do if an
emergency occurs and we don’t have enough volunteer firefighter:
close by to deal with a life threatening situation. Measure L is the
right solution.

Please join local fire and law enforcement leaders, teachers, and
small business owners from across Amador County and vote Yes
on Measure L. The peace of mind that comes with knowing a fire
department will be available to save a house or a life or both is
more than worth the price.
