Shall the special tax be increased by $45.00 per parcel per year to upgrade
the level of emergency medical and fire services within the Garden Valley
Fire Protection District and be levied annually at an established rate not to
exceed the following schedule:

A.	Improved Single Family Real Property - $80.00 per parcel, per year.

B.	Improved Multi Family, Improved Commercial and Improved Industrial
Real Properties - $80.00 per parcel, per year

C.	Unimproved Real Property - $80.00 per parcel, per year.

Arguments For Measure E

The annual parcel assessment fee is $35.00 per parcel per year voted for in
1987. This fee has enabled your fire district to upgrade your fire and first
responder services. The scheduling at this time provides 10 or 12 hours day
coverage 7 days a week. Off duty hours are covered by volunteers and paid
personnel from their homes. Our community continues to grow and so does
the demand for emergency services. In order to meet this demand the district
needs to provide on duty personnel 24 hours a day 7 days a week.

To ensure that our community is receiving the kind of services necessary to
keep them safe and secure there has to be a cost. Within the existing budget
this expanded coverage would over extend the current fiscal boundaries. The
District has explored all options available and must turn to the people they
serve. The suggested $45.00 increase will not completely allow for the
additional personnel necessary, the balance must come from our existing
budget. Having trained professionals on duty 24 hours a day 7 days a week
will give you an immediate response to your emergency.

We are asking you to vote in favor of Measure E. The value of these services
far exceeds the additional cost.
