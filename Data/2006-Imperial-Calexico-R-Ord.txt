CALIFORNIA AMENDING SECTION 3.24.020 OF THE CALEXICO
MUNICIPAL CODE TO CHANGE THE TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY RATE

WHEREAS, the City of Calexico (“City"’) is a municipal corporation organized
and existing under the Constitution and the laws of the State of California; and

WHEREAS, the City of Calexico currently collects a tax from occupants of hotels
within the City of Calexico at a rate of seven percent (7%); and

WHEREAS, the City wishes to have the voters amend Calexico Municipal Code
section 3.24.020, which sets the rate of the transient occupancy tax at seven percent (7%),
to increase the rate to ten percent (10%).

NOW, THEREFORE, the City Council and the people of the City of Calexico
do hereby ordain as follows:

SECTION 1: Calexico Municipal Code section 3.24.020 shall be amended to
read as follows:

“Section 3.24.020 Imposed. For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each
transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of ten percent of the rent charged
by the operator. Said tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city which is
extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city. The transient shall pay the
tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in
installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The
unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for
any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the city finance officer may
require that such tax shall be paid directly to the city finance officer.”
