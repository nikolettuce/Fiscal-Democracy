SAMPLE BALLOT/BOLETA EJEMPLAR

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE “E”

Measure “E” would amend the Transient Occupancy Tax (“TOT”)
to continue at a rate capped at 12 %. The TOT, established by the City
of Banning (“City”) in 1965, applies only to guests who stay at hotels
and motels in the City for less than 30 days.

On November 3,2009, by a vote of 3,337 yes to 1,104 no, (75%)
City voters approved Measure “L”, which authorized the TOT rate to
be increased from the existing 6% to a rate as high as 12% (“the Rate
Cap”). Measure “L” permitted the Council to increase the rate as long
as it did not exceed the 12% Rate Cap. In December, 2009, the Council
increased the tax rate to 10% and on June 22,2010, it was increased to
12%.

Adoption of Measure “L” has resulted in an estimated $330,000
increase in General Fund dollars for the current Fiscal Year. The total
TOT revenue of approximately $600,000 is among the top 6 revenue
sources to the City’s General Fund, and is approximately 5% of all
revenues.

The City’s voters must now approve continuance of the Rate Cap
at 12% by November 3,2014 or the CAP rate will automatically fall back
to 6%.

Measure “E” would continue to require that all TOT collected be
allocated to the City’s General Fund. The revenue would be used to
continue to fund general city services, including: police, public safety,
street maintenance, parks, recreation, senior services and similar
items. Currently, in Banning, the largest government expenditure from
the General Fund is police services, which comprise 50% of the budget.
If Measure “E” is not approved by the City’s voters, the estimated loss
in TOT revenue is $330,000, which is the equivalent of 2.5 entry level
sworn officers or the entire Community Services Department.

Measure “E” was placed on the June 3,2014 ballot after the City
Council unanimously declared a fiscal emergency in the City based on
continued economic and financial challenges at the Federal, State and
local levels, and cuts to additional City staffing. Reductions of $630,000
were necessary to establish a structurally balanced budget for fiscal
year 2013-2014.

Measure “E” allows the City Council to increase or decrease
the TOT, so long as any adjustment does not exceed the Rate Cap.
Measure “E” reserves the right of the Council to make other changes to
the TOT ordinance not affecting the rate. Measure “E” requires approval
from a majority of Banning voters to take effect.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure
“E”. If you desire a copy of the ordinance or measure,
please call the Banning City Clerk’s Office at (951) 922-3102
and a copy will be mailed at no cost to you.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE “E”

Your vote in favor of Measure “E” will allow the City of Banning to keep
the Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) rate, which allows the City to fund
important emergency services.

Measure “E” is NOT a tax increase and does NOT create a new tax for
Banning residents.

The TOT only applies to guests who stay in hotels and motels in the City
for less than 30 days.

Banning Residents DO NOT pay the TOT as a property tax, sales tax,
special tax or any other tax, unless they stay in a Banning hotel or
motel for less than 30 days.

Each year the TOT generates approximately $600,000 that the City
uses to pay for:

❖	Fighting Crime

❖	Emergency Response Services

❖	Street and Community Facilities Maintenance

The City Council, needs you to vote YES on Measure “E" so that we can
continue provide these services at a sufficient level.

This year, Banning was forced to make approximately $630,000 in
cuts to the City budget. These cuts resulted in a loss of 4 sworn police
officer positions and a delay of City maintenance and equipment
replacements.

A loss of TOT money at its current rate will result in a $330,000 loss to
the City. This money is the equivalent of 2.5 entry-level sworn police
officers or the entire Community Services Department.

The Banning TOT rate matches the rate of other California cities such
as Bakersfield, San Dimas and Long Beach. The Banning TOT rate is
tower than other cities such as Anaheim (15%), Riverside (13%), and
Pasadena (12.1%).

Please join the entire City Council, community leaders and residents in
Banning and Vote Yes on Measure “E”.
