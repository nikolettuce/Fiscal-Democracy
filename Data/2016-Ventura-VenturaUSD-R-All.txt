Help Us Keep the Voter File Accurate

In an effort to maintain current voter rolls and reduce waste, the Ventura County Elections Division will be mailing an
alternate residency confirmation notice postcard after the November 8,2016, Presidential General Election, pursuant
to California Elections Code 2224 that permits removal from the active voter roll the names of those registered voters
who have NOT voted in any election nor had their registration updated in the preceding four years.

The pre-addressed return postage-paid postcard MUST BE RETURNED to the Elections Division if a voter wishes to
remain on the active voter roll. However, if you receive a postcard for someone who has moved or does not live at the
address shown on the postcard, return the postcard so that we can maintain a current voter file. Voters who return the
notice with an affirmative response will remain on the active list of registered voters. Voters who DO NOT respond
affirmatively will be placed on an inactive voter list, and will no longer receive election materials. If they fail to vote in
any election between the time they receive the notice and the next two federal general elections, they may be canceled
from the voter file.

Three Ways To Vote

You have three options to choose from for casting your ballot:

Vote By Mail

Vote at your convenience! Receive your ballot in the mail, and either mail it in
or drop it off.

See Page 3 for details

Vote at the Polls

Find your polling place on the back cover of this booklet. Polls are open from
7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. on Election Day, Tuesday, November 8th.

See Page 4 for details

Vote Early at the Elections Office

Starting October 10th, voting is available at the office of the Ventura County
Elections Division. You can come in and cast your ballot, or pick up a Vote By
Mail ballot to take home.

8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.	Ventura County Government Center

Monday through Friday	Hall of Administration - Lower Plaza

(7 a.m. to 8 p.m. on November 8th)	800 South Victoria Avenue, Ventura

Do I Need to Show ID?

In most cases, identification is not required to vote. However, if this is your first time voting and you
did not provide a driver’s license number or social security number when you registered to vote, you
may be required to provide one of the following: 1) A photo ID; or 2) A document with your name
and address, such as a Current Utility Bill, Bank Statement, Government Check, or other
Government Document.

What is a Vote By Mail Ballot Precinct?

If the back cover of this booklet shows “Vote By Mail Ballot Precinct” instead of a Polling Place, this
means that you live in a precinct with fewer than 250 registered voters. These are typically rural
areas, but may also occur due to the various districts holding elections. The issues on your ballot
are based on your location, and may be different from your neighbor’s.

Since it is not practical to establish a polling place for fewer than 250 voters, voters in these
precincts are automatically sent a Vote By Mail Ballot. If you live in a Vote By Mail Ballot Precinct,
your official ballot should arrive in the mail approximately three weeks before Election Day. See
Page 3 for information on how to return your Vote By Mail Ballot.

whether California’s elected officials should use
their authority to propose and ratify an

one another, and to make clear that corporations

Born and raised on the Central Coast, 1 attended Santa Barbara High School and continued my education at UCLA. After playing and coaching football at my alma mater, 1 worked for a senior member of Congress where 1 led a staff delegation to the Syrian border in Turkey and saw first-hand the instability in the region, helped draft several bills, built consensus among members, and successfully moved things forward.  A third generation California cattle rancher and Vice President of my family’s manufacturing and distribution small business, 1 understand the burdensome taxes and regulations coming out of Washington, and the implications it has on businesses, our agricultural community and job opportunities along the Central Coast. I’ve seen the dysfunction, polarization and empty rhetoric coming out of Washington from my time spent on Capitol Hill and 1 know how to fix it.  As your representative, I’ll work to reduce the out of control national debt and overregulation on Central Coast businesses, invest in infrastructure to bring long-range solutions to California’s water crisis, improve our education, ensure economic stability and local job opportunities for generations to come, and advocate for a concerted approach to our national security in order to provide a better way forward for all Americans.

Impartial Analysis by County Counsel*

School districts may levy special taxes, upon approval by two-thirds of the votes cast on a special tax measure, pursuant to Article XIIIA of the
California Constitution and Government Code sections 50075-50077, 50079, and 53722.

The Board of Education (“Board”) of the Ventura Unified School District (“VUSD”) has placed Measure R on the ballot to levy a qualified, special
tax on real property located within the district. The tax would be at an annual rate of $59 per parcel. Approval by VUSD voters will result in
owners of taxable (non-exempt) real property in VUSD continuing to pay a tax of $59 per parcel, annually, for four years, commencing July 1,
2017. A “parcel” is defined as any unit of land that receives a separate tax bill from the Tax Collector. Taxes under Measure R shall be collected
in the same manner and subject to the same penalties as other taxes collected on behalf of the VUSD.

The stated purposes of Measure R are to provide revenue that cannot be taken by the State and to aid in preserving and improving academic
programs in VUSD schools. The proposal includes accountability measures, including creation of a Citizens’ Oversight Committee, which must
provide an annual report to the Board. The accountability measures are declared to provide oversight and accountability to ensure revenues from
the tax are used to fund core academic programs, such as reading writing, science, math, and technology; minimize class size increases and
layoffs for qualified teachers and employees; continue professional development by providing training programs and activities that support quality
teaching; help preserve arts and music instruction, course offerings and electives necessary to prepare students for the competitive process of
college admissions and obtaining work; provide support for students struggling with basic courses; reduce the impact of State budget cuts by
providing a stable local funding source that cannot be taken by the State or others; and protect taxpayers’ investment in education and ensuring
VUSD accountability, by providing for oversight and independent financial audits of revenues and expenditures. However, VUSD’s governing
Board may determine that, in any given school year, changes in student population, fiscal constraints, or changes in state or federal funding make
using revenues from Measure R for such purposes infeasible or inadvisable.

Proceeds of this special tax will be deposited into a separate VUSD account. The account’s proceeds can only be expended for the purposes
identified, as stated and limited above, and an annual written report must be made to the Board showing the amount of funds collected and
expended from tax proceeds as well as the status of any and all projects, programs, or purposes funded from such proceeds.

A “Yes” vote is a vote to approve a $59 per parcel qualified special tax on parcels within VUSD for a four-year period of time. A “No” vote is a vote
not to approve the $59 per parcel tax for such time period.

* Section 9500 of the California Elections Code requires the County Counsel to prepare an Impartial Analysis for each school measure appearing on the ballot.

Argument in Favor of Measure R

Vote YES on Measure R!

Your YES Vote on Measure R will allow us to maintain and improve academic programs such as science, math and technology without increasing
current tax rates. Here’s how.

In 2012, Ventura voters overwhelmingly approved Measure Q to protect our community’s most important asset - our local public schools. Measure
R will extend Measure Q for an additional four years with no increase in the current tax rate and ailow Ventura Unified School District to continue
improving student achievement and making our schools safer.

Measure R will improve our schools by:

Maintaining career and vocational training programs.

Maintaining and improving academic programs such as science, math and technology.

Maintaining and improving school music and arts programs.

Increasing access to technology to help students learn and better prepare for the careers of tomorrow.

Recruiting and retaining highly qualified teachers and staff.

Measure R will protect taxpayers by:

Guaranteeing no increase in the current tax rate.

Including built in, iron-clad, restrictions that the measure will expire in four years and will require voter approval for any extension.

N VE 001-020

Argument in Favor of Measure R (continued)

Prohibiting use of funds to pay administrators’ salaries.

Requiring annual audits and continuing independent citizen oversight of the funds.

Imposing tough legal safeguards requiring all monies to be spent on our local schools.

Prohibiting the State from taking the funds and spending them elsewhere.

Vote YES to continue attracting and retaining high-quality teachers.

Vote YES to continue improving student achievement.

Vote YES for increased property values and home prices by improving neighborhood schools.

Vote YES to protect taxpayers with independent financial audits.

Vote YES to continue turning out our well-educated, well-rounded leaders of tomorrow.

For better and safer schools, higher student achievement, and improved property values, join local business leaders, teachers, parents,
grandparents and neighbors by voting YES on Measure R.

Full Text of Measure R

INTRODUCTION

To aid in preserving and improving academic programs including reading, writing, music, art, science and math; fund computer
technology; retain qualified teachers; and assist in maintaining career and technical training programs; shall Ventura Unified
School District renew its existing $59 parcel tax for four years, raising approximately $2.2 million annually, with an independent
citizens’ oversight committee, all funds spent on neighborhood schools, and no money used for administrative salaries or taken
by the State and spent elsewhere?

PURPOSES

To provide local revenue that cannot be taken by the State and to aid in preserving and improving academic programs in our schools, the
Ventura Unified School District proposes to levy and collect a qualified special parcel tax for a period of four years, beginning July 1,2017, in the
amount of $59 per parcel and to implement accountability measures to provide oversight and accountability to ensure that funds are used to:

•	Fund core academic programs such as reading, writing, science, math, and technology;

•	Minimize class size increases in all grades and layoffs for dozens of qualified teachers and school employees;

•	Continue teacher professional development by providing training programs and activities that support quality teaching;

•	Help preserve arts and music instruction, course offerings and electives that are necessary to prepare students for the
competitive process of college and university admissions and the workforce, and provide instructional support for those
students struggling with the basics;

•	Reduce the impact of deep State budget cuts by providing a stable local funding source that cannot be taken away by
the State or other school districts; and

•	Protect the taxpayers' investment in education and ensure District accountability by providing for oversight and
independent financial audits of revenues and expenditures.

Full Text of Measure R (continued)

The Board of Education will utilize parcel tax proceeds for the purposes listed above, unless the Board of Education determines in any
given year that changes in student population, fiscal constraints, or other changes in state or federal funding make doing so infeasible or inadvisable.
In any event, the parcel tax revenues will be used only for the lawful educational purposes.

EDUCATION PARCEL TAX AND PROCEDURES

Amount of Education Parcel Tax. Subject to two-thirds approval of the voters, the education parcel tax of $59 per parcel (except exempt
parcels, as described below) shall become effective commencing with fiscal year 2017-18 and be collected by the Ventura County Tax Collector at
the same time as and along with, and shall be subject to the same penalties as general ad valorem taxes collected by said tax collector.

Definition of Parcel. A parcel shall be defined as any unit of land in the District that receives a separate tax bill from the Ventura County
Tax Collector.

Exemptions. All property that would otherwise be exempt from property taxes will also be exempt from the qualified special tax

Exclusive Procedures. The procedures described herein with respect to the levy and collection of the education parcel tax and exemptions,
and any additional procedures established by the Board of Education of the District, shall be the exclusive claims procedure for claimants seeking
an exemption, refund, reduction, or re-computation of the qualified special tax. Whether any particular claim is to be resolved by the District or by
the County shall be determined by the District, in coordination with the County, as necessary. The District’s Board of Education may adopt such
additional or supplemental procedures as it deems necessary or convenient for the administration of the education parcel tax.

ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES

Government Code Accountability. In accordance with the requirements of California Government Code sections 50075.1 and 50075.3,
the following accountability measures, among others, shall apply to the qualified special taxes levied in accordance with this Measure:

•	the specific purposes of the education parcel tax shall be those purposes identified above under the heading “PURPOSES,”

•	the proceeds of the education parcel tax shall be applied only to those specific purposes identified above under the heading
“PURPOSES,”

•	a separate, special account shall be created into which the proceeds of the education parcel tax must be deposited; and

•	the chief fiscal officer of the District shall file an annual written report with the Board of Education of the District showing (1)
the amount of funds collected and expended from the proceeds of the education parcel tax and (2) the status of any projects,
programs, or purposes identified above under the heading “PURPOSES.”

Citizens’ Oversight Committee. In addition to the accountability measures required by the Government Code, an independent Citizens’
Oversight Committee shall be appointed by the Board of Education to advise the Board on the expenditures funded by the measure in order to
ensure that said funds are spent for the purposes approved by the voters. The Citizens’ Oversight Committee will monitor the expenditures of these
funds by the District and will report on an annual basis to the Board and community on how these funds have been spent.

PROTECTION OF FUNDING

Current law forbids any decrease in State or Federal funding to the District because of the District’s adoption of an education parcel tax.
However, if any such funds are reduced because of the adoption of this education parcel tax, then the amount of the education parcel tax will be
reduced annually as necessary in order to restore such State or Federal funding.

SEVERABILITY

Impartial Analysis by County Counsel*

The Ventura County Transportation Commission (“Commission”) is a public agency comprised of elected officials representing the cities
and the County, plus two public members. Measure “AA” is an ordinance of the Commission (acting as the Ventura County Local Transportation
Authority under state law) placed on the ballot by the Ventura County Board of Supervisors at the request of the Commission. The ordinance,
described below, is being submitted to the voters for approval and will become effective and operative only if a two-thirds majority of the voters
who cast ballots vote “yes” on the measure.

The ordinance would impose a retail sales and use tax of one-half cent throughout Ventura County, which would remain in effect for 30
years. The tax would be in addition to any existing or future state sales tax. Revenues of the tax imposed by this ordinance would be: dedicated
solely to transportation purposes in Ventura County; placed in a separate account; and used exclusively to fund transportation projects and
programs set forth in the Ventura County Transportation Investment/Expenditure Plan (“Plan”). The Plan includes projects and programs such as
repairing local streets, improving regional roads, improving traffic flow and safety on Highways 101 and 118, keeping senior, veteran, disabled and
student bus and rail fares affordable, increasing pedestrian and bicycle safety, protecting waterways and beaches, and enhancing safe and
reliable commuter/passenger rail service. The ordinance would allow the Commission to amend the Plan pursuant to law and as provided in the
Plan, including to account for additional funds, unexpected revenues and unforeseen circumstances.

The ordinance would require that all revenues of the tax, less required State Board of Equalization costs and administrative costs (which
the ordinance would cap at 1 percent of total revenues), be expended solely in accordance with the Plan. The revenues provided by the ordinance
are intended to supplement, not replace, existing funding for transportation improvements and services. Accordingly, the ordinance would require
the Commission to annually publish a public report on how revenues of the tax have been spent and progress on implementing the Plan. Funds
and expenditures will annually be subject to an audit and a review by a taxpayer oversight committee.

“Pay as you go” is the preferred method of financing transportation projects and programs under the Plan. However, the ordinance
would also authorize the Commission to use bond financing under certain circumstances. The maximum bonded indebtedness outstanding at any
one time cannot exceed the estimated proceeds of the tax. The ordinance also establishes an appropriations limit of $495 million for fiscal year
2017-2018, adjusted thereafter pursuant to law. All expenditures of the tax revenues are subject to the appropriations limit.

If the measure is approved, it will become operative upon the initiation of revenue collection, which the Commission anticipates will be
April 1,2017.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure “AA.” If you want a copy of the measure, please call the election
official’s office at (805) 654-2664 and a copy will be mailed at no cost to you. The voter information handbook includes the entire Plan.

* Section 9160 of the California Elections Code requires the County Counsel to prepare an Impartial Analysis for each county measure appearing on the ballot.

Argument in Favor of Measure AA

Measure AA will make critical investments in Ventura County’s future. Our transportation system is under serious strain. There is too much traffic
congestion on our highways, too many potholes in our streets, and transit services are struggling to maintain service. The longer we wait to make
necessary improvements, the worse these problems will become and the more expensive it will be to fix them.

Measure AA includes strict accountability provisions and independent annual audits. It establishes a Citizens’ Oversight Committee and a Ventura
County Transportation Trust Fund to ensure all funds are used for local transportation priorities and cannot be taken by Sacramento or
Washington, DC.

Measure AA will improve the 101 freeway, which cannot handle the number of cars on the road during peak rush hour traffic. Measure AA will
ensure that traffic flow and safety are improved at all times, bottlenecks are reduced, potholes are quickly repaired, and on- and off-ramps are
upgraded.

Measure AA will improve vanpools and public transit that our growing population of seniors, veterans, and people with disabilities rely on to remain
independent.

Measure AA will ensure funding to protect Ventura County’s waterways and beaches from the harmful pollution caused by street runoff.

N VE 001-023

Argument in Favor of Measure AA (continued)

Measure AA will help strengthen our economy, help local businesses, and create good jobs. Economists estimate that the freeway, local streets
and public transit projects alone will create thousands of local jobs directly and indirectly and generate hundreds of millions of dollars in revenues
for our small, medium and large businesses.

Please join us, along with many elected officials, public safety leaders, educators and the Southern California Automobile Club in supporting
Measure AA.

Rebuttal to Argument in Favor of Measure AA

Measure AA is a $3.3 Billion TAX INCREASE. In the argument in favor they never mention this is a tax. This tax takes $3.3 billion from you and
gives it to government to spend. The oversight will be provided by people appointed by the very same unelected agency wanting the $3.3 billion
tax.

In 1999 and again in 2004 Ventura County voters rejected this tax realizing that ridership is declining and billions are wasted on their new
government program. Experts investigation of Los Angeles and Orange Counties mass transportation confirmed that ridership had declined 10%
and 30% respectively and that $10 Billion dollars had been wasted on mass transit taxes. Ventura County needs current and objective studies to
coordinate on demand ride-sharing, specialized transportation for senior citizens and getting cars off the roads rather than a new $3.3 Billion tax.

They want to tax seniors, veterans and disabled to make this happen. Measure AA provides $191 million for more empty riderless buses to clog
streets and freeways, $191 million for more trains, and $99 million for more bike lanes. Except for proponents, no one believes we have a train
crisis in the County.

Measure AA is about an out of control unelected agency. Just say NO to the $3.3 Billion tax on you, your family and business. This weakens the
private economy by TAKING MONEY FROM YOU AND GIVING IT TO BIG GOVERNMENT.

This is a TAX! And TEMPORARY is hardly 30 years.

Argument Against Measure AA

When government says it wants to impose a “TEMPORARY 30 YEAR” tax, that usually means it's time for taxpayers to hold on to their wallets -
and not let go.

This year, the Ventura County Transportation Commission is sponsoring a $3 billion tax increase, made up of a thirty-year increase in the sales tax
that it says will fund “transportation.”

Ventura County certainly has transportation needs, and investment in infrastructure is important. But this sounds a lot more like the terribly flawed
high speed rail project California voters were sold just a few years ago.

Back then, we were given vague promises and optimistic forecasts about the project coming in on time and under budget. But that wasn't true.

And the high speed rail boondoggle just keeps getting worse.

The VCTC proposal wants to spend $191 million on trains and another $191 million on more empty buses. The VCTC plan also calls for $99
million in new bike lanes and pedestrian trails.

It is also estimated that most cities in Ventura County will receive only 50 percent of the funds generated by the tax increase. Is that fair?

N VE 001-024

Argument Against Measure AA (continued)

Our concern is that the Ventura County Transportation Commission plan is full of generalities and short on specifics.

We need to demand accountability in government and responsibility from our representatives - not more taxes and larger government. This is one
tax increase too many and for too long. WE SHOULD JUST SAY NO!

Rebuttal to Argument Against Measure AA

Funds from Measure AA are controlled by you— it has very strict accountability provisions including a Citizens’ Oversight Committee, annual
audits, and all revenues will go into a Ventura County Transportation Trust Fund.

Congestion on the 101 and 118 freeways is bad and it’s going to get much worse in the coming years if we don’t act now—Measure AA will
improve traffic flow and safety on our freeways.

Our streets and roadways are crumbling and the number of potholes will continue to increase because of deferred maintenance in every city in
Ventura County—50% of the funds from Measure AA will go directly to road repairs and maintenance in your community.

Our senior, veteran and disabled population continues to grow—Measure AA will help maintain the quality of life they deserve by keeping our
transit services reliable and affordable.

Street runoff is polluting our beaches and waterways—Measure AA funds will protect our pristine coastlines and water supplies from the harmful
impact of street runoff.

Ventura County’s economy cannot thrive without investing in our future—Measure AA will reduce worker commute times, create thousands of
good paying local jobs, and allow our small, medium and large businesses to operate more efficiently.

AN ORDINANCE OF THE VENTURA COUNTY TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION ACTING IN ITS CAPACITY AS THE VENTURA COUNTY

LOCAL TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY
IMPOSING A ONE-HALF OF ONE PERCENT TRANSACTIONS AND USE TAX
TO BE ADMINISTERED BY THE STATE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION

THE VENTURA COUNTY TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION, ACTING IN ITS CAPACITY AS THE VENTURA COUNTY LOCAL
TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY, does hereby ordain as follows:

Section 1. PREAMBLE.

A.	Ventura County’s transportation system is used by everyone. Our population is mobile and while Ventura County’s population
grows slower than the rest of southern California, residents are living longer and our young families are growing, and communities are more
connected than ever before for jobs, schools, shopping and entertainment. Unfortunately this means more traffic. Hours wasted in traffic stifle
productivity and rob us of time spent with our families and friends. Our transportation infrastructure is deteriorating. Dramatic reductions in federal
and state funding have left cities struggling to maintain local streets and roads and the Ventura County Transportation Commission unable to fund

major freeway corridor improvements to the 101 and 118. Our population is aging. Without greater investment our seniors face a future of limited
transportation options to access basic services. The Ventura County Transportation Commission has developed a comprehensive and accountable
plan to address our long-term transportation needs while preserving Ventura County's quality of life. The Plan would:

1.	PRESERVE VENTURA COUNTY’S QUALITY OF LIFE: make transportation improvements that preserve the
character and mobility of local communities and that keep Ventura County moving.

2.	REPAIR LOCAL STREETS: fix potholes, repave roads and repair bridges; provide funding to local cities to maintain
and improve neighborhood streets and sidewalks.

3.	IMPROVE FREEWAY SAFETY AND TRAFFIC FLOW: improve traffic flow and safety on 101 and 118; ensure people
and freight move safely and efficiently on regional roads.

4.	KEEP RAIL AND TRANSIT AVAILABLE AND AFFORDABLE: keep senior, veteran, disabled, student fares affordable;
maintain a sustainable bus and rail system.

5.	IMPROVE SAFETY: increase bicycle and pedestrian safety; earthquake retrofit bridges and overpasses; make
merging onto freeways safer and easier and improve safety at intersections and rail crossings.

6.	PROTECT WATER WAYS AND BEACHES: protect water ways and beaches from polluted runoff and restore
watersheds.

B.	Pursuant to California Public Utilities Code Section 180050, the Ventura County Transportation Commission has been
designated as the Ventura County Local Transportation Authority (hereinafter called the “Authority”) by the Ventura County Board of Supervisors.

C.	Pursuant to California Public Utilities Code Section 180206, a countywide transportation expenditure plan, referred to as the
Ventura County Transportation Investment/Expenditure Plan (hereinafter called the “Plan”), dated July 8, 2016, has been adopted and will be
administered and implemented by the Authority.

D.	The Plan provides for needed countywide transportation facility, service and related improvements funded, in whole or in part,
by a transactions and use tax of one-half of one percent for a period of thirty (30) years. The Plan is incorporated herein by this reference as though
fully set forth herein, and as that Plan may be amended from time to time pursuant to applicable law and as provided for in the Plan and this
ordinance.

Section 2. TITLE. This ordinance shall be known as the Ventura County Transportation Commission Transactions and Use Tax
Ordinance, and may also be referenced herein as the “ordinance.” This ordinance shall be applicable in the incorporated and unincorporated territory
of the County of Ventura, which shall be referred to herein as “District.”

Section 3. OPERATIVE DATE. “Operative Date” means the first day of the first calendar quarter commencing more than 110 days after
the adoption of this ordinance, the date of such adoption being as set forth below.

Section 4. PURPOSE. This ordinance is adopted to permit implementation of the Plan and achieve the following, among other purposes.
It directs that the provisions hereof be interpreted in order to accomplish those purposes:

A.	To impose a retail transactions and use tax in accordance with the provisions of Part 1.6 (commencing with Section 7251) of
Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code and Section 180000 et seq. of the Public Utilities Code which authorizes the Authority to adopt this
tax ordinance which shall be operative if the legally required number of electors voting on the measure vote to approve the imposition of the tax at
an election called for that purpose.

B.	To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that incorporates provisions identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax
Law of the State of California insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.6 of Division
2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.

N VE 001-026

Full Text of Measure AA (continued)

C.	To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that imposes a tax and provides a measure therefor that can be
administered and collected by the State Board of Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as practicable to, and requires the least possible
deviation from, the existing statutory and administrative procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in administering and collecting the
California State Sales and Use Taxes.

D.	To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that can be administered in a manner that will be, to the greatest degree
possible, consistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting the transactions
and use taxes, and at the same time, minimize the burden of record keeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this ordinance.

Section 5. CONTRACT WITH STATE. Prior to the operative date, the Authority shall contract with the State Board of Equalization to
perform all functions incident to the administration and operation of this transactions and use tax ordinance; provided, that if the Authority shall not
have contracted with the State Board of Equalization prior to the operative date, it shall nevertheless so contract and in such a case the operative
date shall be the first day of the first calendar quarter following the execution of such a contract.

Section 6. TRANSACTIONS TAX RATE. For the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail, a tax is hereby imposed upon
all retailers in the incorporated and unincorporated territory of the District at the rate of one-half of one percent of the gross receipts of any retailer
from the sale of all tangible personal property sold at retail in said territory on and after the operative date of this ordinance.

Section 7. PLACE OF SALE. For the purposes of this ordinance, all retail sales are consummated at the place of business of the retailer
unless the tangible personal property sold is delivered by the retailer or his agent to an out-of-state destination or to a common carrier for delivery
to an out-of-state destination. The gross receipts from such sales shall include delivery charges, when such charges are subject to the state sales
and use tax, regardless of the place to which delivery is made. In the event a retailer has no permanent place of business in the State or has more
than one place of business, the place or places at which the retail sales are consummated shall be determined under rules and regulations to be
prescribed and adopted by the State Board of Equalization.

Section 8. USE TAX RATE. An excise tax is hereby imposed on the storage, use or other consumption in the District of tangible personal
property purchased from any retailer on and after the operative date of this ordinance for storage, use or other consumption in said territory at the
rate of one-half of one percent of the sales price of the property. The sales price shall include delivery charges when such charges are subject to
state sales or use tax regardless of the place to which delivery is made.

Section 9. ADOPTION OF PROVISIONS OF STATE LAW. Except as otherwise provided in this ordinance and except insofar as they
are inconsistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, all of the provisions of Part 1 (commencing with
Section 6001) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code are hereby adopted and made a part of this ordinance as though fully set forth herein.

Section 10. LIMITATIONS ON ADOPTION OF STATE LAW AND COLLECTION OF USE TAXES. In adopting the provisions of Part 1 of
Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code:

A.	Wherever the State of California is named or referred to as the taxing agency, the name of this Authority shall be substituted
therefor. However, the substitution shall not be made when:

1.	The word “State” is used as a part of the title of the State Controller, State Treasurer, Victim Compensation & Government
Control Board, State Board of Equalization, State Treasury, or the Constitution of the State of California.

2.	The result of that substitution would require action to be taken by or against this Authority or any agency, officer, or
employee thereof rather than by or against the State Board of Equalization, in performing the functions incident to the administration or operation of
this ordinance.

3.	In those sections, including, but not necessarily limited to sections referring to the exterior boundaries of the State of
California, where the result of the substitution would be to:

a. Provide an exemption from this tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal
property which would not otherwise be exempt from this tax while such sales, storage, use or other consumption remain subject to tax by the State
under the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, or;

N VE 001-027

Full Text of Measure AA (continued)

b. Impose this tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property, which
would not be subject to tax by the state under the said provision of that code.

4.	In Sections 6701, 6702 (except in the last sentence thereof), 6711, 6715, 6737, 6797 or 6828 of the Revenue and

Taxation Code.

B.	The word “District” shall be substituted for the word “State” in the phrase “retailer engaged in business in this State” in Section
6203 and in the definition of that phrase in Section 6203.

Section 11. PERMIT NOT REQUIRED. If a seller’s permit has been issued to a retailer under Section 6067 of the Revenue and Taxation
Code, an additional transactor’s permit shall not be required by this ordinance.

Section 12. EXEMPTIONS AND EXCLUSIONS.

A.	There shall be excluded from the measure of the transactions tax and the use tax the amount of any sales tax or use tax
imposed by the State of California or by any city, city and county, or county pursuant to the Bradley-Bums Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax Law or
the amount of any state-administered transactions or use tax.

address and by a declaration under penalty of perjury, signed by the buyer, stating that such address is, in fact, his or her principal place of residence;
and

b.	With respect to commercial vehicles, by registration to a place of business out-of-District and declaration under
penalty of perjury, signed by the buyer, that the vehicle will be operated from that address.

4.	A lease of tangible personal property which is a continuing sale of such property, for any period of time for which the
lessor is obligated to lease the property for an amount fixed by the lease prior to the operative date of this ordinance.

5.	For the purposes of subparagraphs (3) and (4) of this section, the sale or lease of tangible personal property shall be
deemed not to be obligated pursuant to a contract or lease for any period of time for which any party to the contract or lease has the unconditional
right to terminate the contract or lease upon notice, whether or not such right is exercised.

C.	There are exempted from the use tax imposed by this ordinance, the storage, use or other consumption in this District of
tangible personal property:

Full Text of Measure AA (continued)

2.	Other than fuel or petroleum products purchased by operators of aircraft and used or consumed by such operators directly
and exclusively in the use of such aircraft as common carriers of persons or property for hire or compensation under a certificate of public convenience

provided in Sections 6366 and 6366.1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code of the State of California.

3.	If the purchaser is obligated to purchase the property for a fixed price pursuant to a contract entered into prior to the
operative date of this ordinance.

4.	If the possession of, or the exercise of any right or power over, the tangible personal property arises under a lease, which
is a continuing purchase of such property for any period of time for which the lessee is obligated to lease the property for an amount fixed by a lease
prior to the operative date of this ordinance.

5.	For the purposes of subparagraphs (3) and (4) of this section, storage, use, or other consumption, or possession of, or
exercise of any right or power over, tangible personal property shall be deemed not to be obligated pursuant to a contract or lease for any period of
time for which any party to the contract or lease has the unconditional right to terminate the contract or lease upon notice, whether or not such right
is exercised.

6.	Except as provided in subparagraph (7), a retailer engaged in business in the District shall not be required to collect use
tax from the purchaser of tangible personal property, unless the retailer ships or delivers the property into the District or participates within the District
in making the sale of the property, including, but not limited to, soliciting or receiving the order, either directly or indirectly, at a place of business of
the retailer in the District or through any representative, agent, canvasser, solicitor, subsidiary, or person in the District under the authority of the
retailer.

7.	“A retailer engaged in business in the District” shall also include any retailer of any of the following: vehicles subject to
registration pursuant to Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 4000) of Division 3 of the Vehicle Code, aircraft licensed in compliance with Section
21411 of the Public Utilities Code, or undocumented vessels registered under Division 3.5 (commencing with Section 9840) of the Vehicle Code.
That retailer shall be required to collect use tax from any purchaser who registers or licenses the vehicle, vessel, or aircraft at an address in the
District.

D.	Any person subject to use tax under this ordinance may credit against that tax any transactions tax or reimbursement for
transactions tax paid to a district imposing, or retailer liable for a transactions tax pursuant to Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation
Code with respect to the sale to the person of the property the storage, use or other consumption of which is subject to the use tax.

Section 13. AMENDMENTS. All amendments subsequent to the effective date of this ordinance to Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue
and Taxation Code relating to sales and use taxes and which are not inconsistent with Part 1.6 and Part 1.7 of Division 2 of the Revenue and
Taxation Code, and all amendments to Part 1.6 and Part 1.7 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, shall automatically become a part of
this ordinance, provided however, that no such amendment shall operate so as to affect the rate of tax imposed by this ordinance.

Section 14. USE OF PROCEEDS. The proceeds of the transactions and use tax imposed by this Ordinance shall be used solely for the
projects, programs and purposes set forth in the Ventura County Transportation Investment/Expenditure Plan, as it may be amended from time to
time, and for the administration thereof.

Section 15. MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT. It is the intent of the Legislature and the Authority that proceeds from the transactions and use
tax be used to supplement, not replace, existing funds being used for transportation improvements and services. Maintenance of Effort standards
are established in the Plan. Under no circumstances shall proceeds from the transactions and use tax be used to substitute or replace obligations
that new development may incur for mitigating impacts on infrastructure or the environment.

Section 16. BONDING AUTHORITY. “Pay as you go” is the preferred method of financing transportation improvements and services
under the Plan. However, the Authority may and is authorized to use bond financing as an alternative method if the scope and timing of planned
expenditures makes “pay as you go” infeasible. Following approval by the electors of the ballot proposition authorizing imposition of the transactions
and use tax, bonds may be issued by the Authority pursuant to Division 19 of the Public Utilities Code, at any time after imposition of taxes, and from
time to time, payable from the proceeds of the tax and secured by a pledge of revenues from the proceeds of the tax, in order to finance and refinance
improvements authorized by the ordinance. The maximum bonded indebtedness which may be outstanding at any one time shall be an amount

N VE 001-029

Full Text of Measure AA (continued)

equal to the sum of the principal of, and interest on, the bonds, but shall not exceed the estimated proceeds of the transactions and use tax, as
determined by the Plan.

Section 17. APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT. For purposes of Public Utilities Code section 180202, the appropriations limit for the Authority for
fiscal year 2017-18 shall be $495,000,000 and thereafter that amount should be amended pursuant to applicable law. All expenditures of the
transactions and use tax authorized herein shall be subject to the appropriations limit of the Authority.

Section 18. ADMINISTRATION AND SPENDING LIMIT. The Authority shall allocate revenues from the transactions and use tax to fund
facilities, services and projects as specified in the Plan and shall administer the ordinance and the Plan consistent with the authority cited. Revenues
from the tax may be expended by the Authority for salaries, wages, benefits, and overhead for those services, including contractual services,
necessary to carry out its responsibilities; however, in no case shall the tax revenues expended for salaries and benefits of the Authority
administrative staff exceed more than one percent (1 %) of the funds generated by the tax in any year. The Authority may, as the law permits, contract
with any public agency or private firm for services necessary to carry out the purposes of the ordinance and the Plan.

Section 19. SAFEGUARDS ON USE OF TAX PROCEEDS. The following safeguards are hereby established to ensure strict adherence
to limitations on the use of the proceeds from the transactions and use tax:

A.	A transportation special revenue fund (the “Local Transportation Authority Special Revenue Fund”) shall be established to
maintain all proceeds from the transactions and use tax.

B.	Receipt, maintenance and expenditure of proceeds from the transactions and use tax by any entity shall be distinguishable in
the entity's accounting records from other funding sources and expenditures shall be distinguishable by program or project. Interest earned on funds
allocated pursuant to the ordinance and the Plan shall be expended only for those purposes for which the funds were allocated.

C.	No proceeds from the transactions and use tax shall be used by any entity for other than the purposes authorized by the
ordinance and the Plan. Any entity that violates this provision must fully reimburse the Authority for the funds misspent, plus any accrued interest,
and will have any further allocations withheld until all funds are reimbursed.

Section 20. ALLOCATION OF FUNDS TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. The allocation formula for funds provided to local jurisdictions for
Local Streets, Roads and Transportation Priorities as shown in the Table on Page 2 of the Plan was established by a cooperative effort with all
jurisdictions in the county represented. The formula is based on the percentages of total road miles and total lane miles provided to the Authority as
of April 21,2016 by the local jurisdictions. The formula provides the following:

A.	The County of Ventura shall receive a percentage of the funds based upon the percentage of total road miles occurring within
the unincorporated area. These funds shall come “off the top” of the total funds available for Local Streets, Roads, and Transportation Priorities in
the Plan.

B.	Each city shall receive a percentage of the remaining funds based upon the percentage of total lane miles occurring within
the city relative to all incorporated lane miles for cities within the county.

C.	If a city's lane miles are such that its annual allocation does not equal at least $500,000, funds shall be deducted from the
County of Ventura’s share such that no city receives less than $500,000 annually.

D.	These formulas may be updated on an annual basis by local jurisdictions submitting evidence of new lane miles constructed
within a city or new road miles constructed within the unincorporated area of the county at which time all local jurisdiction shares will be adjusted
accordingly.

Section 21. ANNUAL REPORT. Annually the Authority shall publish a report on how all proceeds from the transactions and use tax have
been spent and on progress in implementing the Plan, and shall publicly report on the findings.

Section 22. REQUEST FOR ELECTION. Pursuant to California Public Utilities Code Section 180201, the Authority hereby requests that
the County of Ventura Board of Supervisors call a special election to be conducted by the County of Ventura on November 8, 2016 to place the
following measure before the electors:

N VE 001-030

Full Text of Measure AA (continued)

To help preserve Ventura County’s quality of life by:

fixing potholes, repaving streets, repairing bridges;

improving traffic flow and safety on 101 and 118;

keeping senior, veteran, disabled, and student bus fares affordable;

increasing bicycle and pedestrian safety; protecting waterways and

beaches from polluted runoff and restoring watersheds;

Shall Ventura County’s sales tax be increased by one-half cent for
thirty years, raising $70 million annually, with independent
oversight and audits, and with all funds benefiting local residents?

Section 23. COMPLIANCE WITH CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT. The Authority finds that this ordinance is exempt
from the California Environmental Quality Act (Public Resources Code §§21000 “CEQA,” and 14 Cal. Code Reg. §§ 15000 etseq., “CEQA
Guidelines”). The transactions and use tax authorized by this ordinance is a special tax that can only be used to fund the projects, facilities, and
services described in the Plan but does not approve any of the described projects or services. As such, under CEQA Guidelines section 15378(b)(4),
the tax is not a project within the meaning of CEQA because it creates a government funding mechanism that does not involve any commitment to
any specific project or service that may result in a potentially significant physical impact on the environment. If revenue from the tax were used for a
purpose that would have such effect, the Authority or appropriate lead agency would undertake the required CEQA review for that particular project
or service. Therefore, pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15060, review of the ordinance under CEQA is not required. Prior to commencement
of any project or service included in the Ventura County Investment/Expenditure Plan, any necessary environmental review required by CEQA shall
be completed. The Authority or appropriate lead agency for any project funded by the revenue from the tax shall perform CEQA analysis for the
project prior to approving the project or service, if the project or service requires analysis under CEQA.

Section 24. ENJOINING COLLECTION FORBIDDEN. No injunction or writ of mandate or other legal or equitable process shall issue in
any suit, action or proceeding in any court against the State or the Authority, or against any officer of the State or the Authority, to prevent or enjoin
the collection under this ordinance, or Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, of any tax or any amount of tax required to be
collected.

Section 25. VALIDATION OF TAX AND BONDS. Any action or proceedings questioning, contesting, or denying the validity of the adoption
of this transactions and use tax ordinance or issuance of any bonds thereunder or any proceeding related thereto shall be commenced within six
months from the date of the election at which this ordinance is approved. Otherwise, the bonds and all proceedings related thereto, including the
adoption and approval of this ordinance, shall be held valid and in every respect legal and incontestable.

Section 26. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this ordinance or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the
remainder of the ordinance and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.

Section 27. EFFECTIVE DATE. This ordinance relates to the levying and collecting of the District transactions and use taxes and shall
take effect immediately.

Section 28. TERMINATION DATE. The authority to levy the tax imposed by this ordinance shall expire March 31,2047.

Transportation touches every area of our
lives on a daily basis and we often overlook
its importance. We expect our roads to
carry us safely and efficiently to where we
want to go, that we have options to driving
and can bike, walk or take a bus. Business
owners need and should have easy access
to their locations for their workers, customers
and goods so that Ventura County’s economy
thrives. Mobility is an essential ingredient in
the quality of life that we’ve come to expect
in Ventura County.

The transportation system that enables
mobility in Ventura County is beginning
to show the strain of many years of
under-funding. Highways once free flowing
are now congested, pot holes are an all too
familiar sight on city streets and bus and rail
services are struggling just to maintain
current schedules and fares.

While maintenance costs are increasing
significantly. State and Federal funding for
transportation is diminishing and typically
requires a commitment (sometimes dollar for
dollar) for a local investment before funds
are allocated. Absent local funding, taxes

collected in Ventura County, which should
help support local roads, go to other
counties that offer local matching funds. All
this contributes to a transportation system
which cannot meet our current or future
needs. Local investment in our transportation
system enables Ventura County to compete
for federal and state funds and bring your
tax dollars back to the County.

The Ventura County Transportation
Commission/Ventura County Local
Transportation Authority (VCTC) coordinates
funding for most transportation activities in
Ventura County and believes now is the time
for residents to invest in the future and
repair, preserve and improve the transportation
system that adds so much to Ventura County’s
quality of life. The VCTC has been talking
with communities throughout the County
and has developed this County Transportation
Investment/Expenditure Plan, pursuant to
Public Utilities Codes section 180206 that
prioritizes investments in the areas that residents
want to see improvement in, hereinafter
referred to in the “Plan” that is set forth in
the following pages.

1

INVESTMENT IN LOCAL STREETS,
ROADS & TRANSPORTATION

PRIORITIES	ESTIMATED	INVESTMENT:

Whether by car, bus, bike or walking, nearly
every trip in Ventura County begins on a
local street. The upkeep and maintenance
of local streets and roads affects all of us as
we travel throughout our day. Typically, we
only think about streets and roads when the
conditions start to deteriorate. Every city
and the County of Ventura have expressed
and quantified their struggle to maintain the
condition of local streets and have advised
of a substantial shortfall in funding just to
maintain road conditions in their current
state.

This Plan includes assistance for the cities and
the County of Ventura that must maintain
our local streets. A total of 50 percent of all
Plan funds, approximately $1,650,000,000,
would be returned to local jurisdictions to
augment their revenues for the maintenance
and improvement of the nearly 2,500 miles
of local streets and local transportation
systems. To ensure an equitable distribution
of those funds to the local jurisdictions, a
formula has been developed by the cities
and the County of Ventura, that a) provides
a minimum of $500,000 to each jurisdiction
annually; b) provides the County of Ventura
with 22.3% of the local street and roads
funds; c) allocates the remainder of local
streets and roads funds based on the
percentage of lane miles within a jurisdiction.
Each jurisdiction will receive funds as shown
in the table below.

INVESTMENT IN LOCAL STREETS,
ROADS & TRANSPORTATION_^H

PRIORITIES	ESTIMATED	INVESTMENT:

The County of Ventura and the cities are
best positioned to determine their local
needs for maintenance and improvements
and this program is designed to give local
jurisdictions the greatest flexibility in the use
of these funds. Local jurisdictions may apply
these funds to any transportation related
project including but not limited to street
repair, pavement maintenance, road
widening, installation of bike lanes, side-
walks, pedestrian walkways, transit stop
improvements, contributions to transit
services, Safe Routes to School Programs,
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS),
and/or other transportation projects as local
jurisdictions deem necessary for the
betterment of their residents under the
conditions as follows:

•	The funds distributed through this Plan
to local jurisdictions are intended to
augment local jurisdictions’ funds that
are normally or typically designated for
transportation programs or projects.
Local jurisdictions must continue their
normal practices to fund transportation
projects.

•	To ensure that all users of streets and
roads are considered, all jurisdictions
must be compliant with Assembly Bill
1358, the California Complete Streets
Act of 2008. If a jurisdiction has not yet
updated its circulation plan to include a
complete streets element, it may utilize
the first year’s Plan allocation to become
compliant but no other funds will be allo-
cated until the jurisdiction has completed
a Complete Streets Plan as required by
the legislation.

•	All jurisdictions must comply with re-
porting requirements by submitting a
five year Capital Improvement Plan out-
lining the anticipated use of Plan funds,
provide an annual accounting of Plan
funds expended, and provide a timely
use of Plan funds report for review by
the Taxpayer Oversight Committee.

FREEWAY

PROGRAM

ESTIMATED INVESTMENT:

$660 MILLION

Traffic relief is the focal point of the freeway
program in the Plan. Over the past 10 years
Caltrans with funding allocated by VCTC has built
several freeway traffic flow improvement projects,
thanks to the 2006 passage of Proposition IB, a
statewide transportation bond measure. However,
as the economy has improved traffic has become
a source of frustration for commuters and
businesses alike, especially on sections of 101
and 118 that have not recently been improved. All
of the Proposition IB funds are now spent and
meanwhile other state funds for road improve-
ments have dwindled. With current state and
federal funding it will be many years before there
can be any new freeway traffic flow improvement
projects started in Ventura County.

This Plan will implement critically-needed freeway
projects to improve the 101 and 118 freeways. By
making local tax funds available, state and federal
funds available for freeways can be leveraged
more quickly. The funding plan for these
improvements includes the cost of related
environmental mitigation measures such as new
soundwalls and water runoff pollution control
features.

The Plan and tax measure make available $660
million for the freeway program. The overall
transportation program is also funded using 100%
of expected State Transportation Improvement
Program revenue ($249 million) and 100% of
federal Surface Transportation Program funds
($332 million), for a total of $1,241,000,000.

4

FREEWAY PROGRAM

Route 101 from Ventura/Los
Angeles County Line to Route 33
in Ventura

Route 101 is the “Main Street” of Ventura County
and most of this freeway has not been improved
since the 1980’s. Congestion has become much
worse in the past 10 years, causing several major
bottlenecks, including those near the Moorpark
Road, Rice Avenue, and Johnson Drive inter-
changes, as well as the entire stretch through
Camarillo.

The freeway carries an average of 140,000
vehicles per day, and traffic congestion is
expected to increase by 50% by 2035. The
planned improvements will improve traffic flow,
increase safety, and expedite VCTC Intercity
Bus service over 28 miles through Thousand
Oaks, Camarillo, Oxnard, and Ventura, by adding
carpool lanes in the center median and merging
lanes between interchanges. Additionally, local
interchanges will be rebuilt to accommodate
mobility and safety improvements. VCTC will
take the lead in the project, with Caltrans
providing oversight in its role as the freeway
owner/operator. Specific improvements will be
subject to approved plans developed in
cooperation with local jurisdictions and affected
communities.

Route 118 from Route 23 in
Moorpark to Tapo Canyon Road
in Simi Valley

Thanks to Proposition IB, Route 118 has been
widened from Tapo Canyon Road in Simi Valley
to the Ventura/Los Angeles county line at
Santa Susanna Pass Road. However, choke-
points have now formed at Tapo Canyon, and
also at the western end of the 118 Freeway
where it joins the wider 23 Freeway.

The Plan includes widening over 9 miles of
freeway between Tapo Canyon and Route 23,
to eliminate the traffic bottlenecks and
increase safety. Besides adding lanes, the
widening plan includes soundwalls, a concrete
median safety barrier, and interchange and
bridge improvements. Caltrans will take the
lead in implementing the project with VCTC
administering the funds. When completed, the
project will result in Routes 23 and 118 forming
a continuous freeway of 3 lanes in each
direction from the 101 in Thousand Oaks to
Collins Drive in Moorpark, and 4 lanes in each
direction from Collins Drive in Moorpark to
Santa Susana Pass Road near Simi Valley.
Specific improvements will be subject to
approved plans developed in cooperation with
local jurisdictions and affected communities.

REGIONAL ROADS/
MILITARY ACCESS/
FREIGHT MOVEMENT

Freight movement plays a vital role in
maintaining Ventura County’s economy. It’s
particularly important to keep freight
flowing quickly and safely to and from the
Port of Hueneme as well as to allow people
and goods to access Naval Base Ventura
County without degrading local traffic. The
County’s regional roads and state highways
play a significant role in connecting together
the cities within the County, and linking Routes
101 and 126.

The proposed road improvements will reduce
the chance of auto, truck and bicycle
accidents in rural areas. These projects will
also make it easier for residents to access
freeways, for emergency vehicles to respond
quickly to serious incidents, and for goods,
including agricultural products, to move freely
throughout Ventura County. The final scope
and project limits of all improvements will be
determined through noticed public hearings,
environmental clearance process, and agree-
ment with affected agencies.

Congress recently authorized a new federal
program to annually make available $1.9 bil-
lion nationwide for freight projects. Given that
VCTC has already developed a comprehensive
transportation plan that addresses freight
movement needs, Ventura County is well-
positioned to benefit from this federal
program, but only if there are local funds to
leverage the newly-available federal funds.

This Plan will provide those necessary funds.

The Plan will provide nearly $228 million for
the regional road program. Under the Plan this
funding would be used to leverage an
additional $63 million over 30 years from the
newly-established federal freight program.

The projects will be implemented by local
jurisdictions such as the County of Ventura
and the cities.

The Plan includes the following projects:

• Improve safety and traffic flow on Rice
Avenue at Fifth Street in Oxnard, by
eliminating the train crossing which has
been the site of several recent accidents.

ESTIMATED
INVESTMENT:
$227.7 MILLION

S

The project will build a bridge for Rice
Avenue to pass over the tracks and also
over Fifth Street. Traffic ramps will be built
to connect Rice and Fifth.

•	Enhance traffic flow, safety, and pavement
strength on the main access route serving
the Port of Hueneme, by implementing
the following: (1) widening Hueneme Road
from 2 to 4 lanes from Edison Drive to Rice
Avenue; and (2) Install safety improvements
and strengthen pavement on Rice Avenue
from Route 101 to Hueneme Road.

•	Better connect 101 and 126 through the
following projects: (1) widen from 2 to
4 lanes Rose Avenue from Central in
Oxnard to Route 118 in Saticoy, Rice Avenue
from Auto Center Drive in Oxnard to 118

in Saticoy, and Central Avenue between
Santa Clara Avenue and Del Norte Road in
Oxnard; and (2) improve the Rose/118 and
Rice/118 intersections in Saticoy.

•	Construct other projects selected by
VCTC on a competitive basis. Projects
will be selected based on congestion
relief, safety improvement, cost effectiveness,
project readiness, and similar criteria to be
determined. State highways including but
not limited to, State Route 1, 23, 33, 34,118,

126,150, and 232 will be eligible for these
funds.

•	Implement qualifying projects in the
local jurisdictions’ General Plan Circulation

Improving bus transit is a key component in
Ventura County’s transportation system. The
bus system enables mobility for those who
don’t drive and offers a choice to those who
do. Underscoring the need for improved bus
service is the projection from the U.S. Census
Bureau that the 65 and older population will
double by 2030. The bus transit elements of
this Plan benefits people who live in Ventura
County by keeping fares affordable for
seniors, youth/students, veterans, and
people with disabilities, and maintaining and
expanding bus, and demand responsive
services. This program provides transit
operators with a flexible, consistent funding
source for maintaining, restoring, and
improving transit services in Ventura County.

BUS TRANSIT ENHANCEMENT
& FARE SUPPORT
PROGRAM

ESTIMATED INVESTMENT:

;191.4 MILLION

Countywide Affordable Fares
Program: $38,280,000

The plan provides funding for regional fare
programs that keep fares affordable for
seniors, youth/students, veterans, and people
with disabilities. VCTC will work collaboratively
with all Ventura County transit operators,
providing direct funding to keep fares
affordable and utilizing proven technologies
and fare mediums to ensure an effective and
sustainable program.

County Transit Improvement
Program: $153,120,000

This program provides funds for local
solutions to the growing transportation
needs through a flexible need-based process
that will expand public transit services
(including services to seniors and persons
with disabilities) through increased
frequencies, neighborhood feeder services,
peak hour commute and express service,
bus-rapid transit, expanded bike/bus
programs, vehicles purchases, capital
improvements and improved connectivity
through enhanced intercity and intercounty
service.

COMMUTER RAIL
ENHANCEMENTS

ESTIMATED
INVESTMENT:
$191.4 MILLION

These funds will maintain and increase safe
and reliable commuter/passenger rail service
for Ventura County residents. This program
provides a stable and continuous source of
funding for Metrolink commuter rail service.
Metrolink commuter rail service is critical
to all residents of Ventura County to relieve
congestion and provide a commute
alternative. Moreover, Metrolink service plays
a key role in our environment, by reducing
vehicle emissions to keep our air clean. This
plan provides the funds to continue
commuter/passenger rail operations in
Ventura County and make the needed safety
and capital improvements on all commuter/
passenger rail lines and support operating
costs. Eligible expenditures are capital and
operating costs.

INVESTMENT IN
BICYCLE & PEDESTRIAN

ESTIMATED

IMPROVEMENTS

INVESTMENT:
$99 MILLION

A comprehensive transportation system
must ensure that all modes of transportation
are integrated into it and supported. This
Plan includes assistance for jurisdictions
specifically for bicycle and pedestrian
projects. A total of 3% of all Plan funds,
approximately $99,000,000, will be
dedicated for bicycle and pedestrian
projects.

Funding would occur through a competitive
grant program designed to improve both
the bicycling and pedestrian infrastructure
throughout Ventura County. Funds could be
used for planning, project development,
construction, maintenance and/or to match
federal and/or state grant funds including
but not limited to Safe Routes to School
Programs, Active Transportation Program
(ATP) and Congestion Mitigation and Air
Quality (CMAQ). Along with the cities and
the County of Ventura, school districts,
colleges, and universities would be eligible
to compete for these funds.

These funds are meant to augment any
existing funds and not as a replacement for
funds that an entity has historically used for
this activity. Each grant recipient would be
subject to requirements for the timely use of
funds and an annual reporting of expenditures
for review by the Taxpayer Oversight
Committee.

9

TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENT

IN THE NATURAL
ENVIRONMENT

A transportation system that ensures
mobility throughout Ventura County adds
substantially to the quality of life but
development of that transportation system
cannot ignore the impacts that it may have
on the environment. While individual
projects in this Plan would include project
specific mitigations, this program includes a
total of 6% of all Plan funds, approximately
$198,000,000, for transportation invest-
ments that enable the preservation and/or
improvement of Ventura County’s natural
environment.

A regional advanced mitigation program will
enhance funding for individual project
mitigations by enabling comprehensive,
rather than piecemeal mitigation of the
environmental impacts of major regional
transportation improvements funded by
the Plan. Funds will be available to provide
high-value, landscape-scale benefits such
as habitat protection, wildlife corridors,
and watershed protection in exchange for
streamlined programmatic permits and
approvals from regulatory agencies such as:

•	California Department of Fish and
Wildlife

•	U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service

•	State and Regional Water Quality
Control Boards

•	U.S. Army Corps of Engineers

•	U.S. Environmental Protection Agency

Funding would occur through a competitive
grant program, based upon an open,
science-based process, involving interested,
knowledgeable stakeholders, to ensure
maximum benefit and protection to impacted
areas and sensitive, threatened and endangered
habitat and species. Funds could be used
for planning, project development, land
acquisition, construction, maintenance, and/
or to match other grant funds.

ESTIMATED INVESTMENT:
$198 MILLION

Priority will be given to projects that have
strong community and stakeholder support,
demonstrated readiness, and the ability to
attract matching funds, grants, and in-kind
contributions from local state, federal and
non-profit entities. Projects must provide a
direct nexus to transportation and may
include but are not limited to:

•	Reduction or elimination of runoff from
highways, streets and roads including
drainage improvements; bioswales and
biofiltration channels; maintenance of
catch basins, filters and screens; or other
water quality improvements.

•	Protection and/or restoration of habitat
and watersheds including wetlands, rivers,
streams, riparian corridors, and removal or
modification of fish passage barriers that
are or have been impacted by transporta-
tion infrastructure.

•	Infrastructure or programs designed to
enhance and protect opportunities for
human interaction in natural areas such as
hiking trails, raised trails, biking trails, trail
bridges, signage, or other improvements.

Along with the cities and the County of
Ventura, special districts, Caltrans, California
Department of Fish and Wildlife, U.S. Fish
and WildLife and U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers would be eligible to compete for
these funds. Each grant recipient would be
subject to requirements for the timely use of
funds and an annual reporting of expenditures
for review by the Taxpayer Oversight
Committee.

Plan funds must augment, not replace,
existing transportation related environmental
quality, environmental mitigation, water
quality and watershed expenditures.

ADMINISTRATION, ACCOUNTABILITY
& OVERSIGHT CONT.

Comprehensive Review of Progress
and Performance

At least every ten years, a comprehensive
review of all programs and projects
implemented under the Plan will be under-
taken to evaluate the status and performance
of the overall program. The review shall
include consideration of changes to local,
state and federal transportation plans and
policies; changes in land use, travel and
growth projections; changes in environmental
standards and policies; changes in project
cost estimates and revenue projections;
project constraints; level of public support
for the Plan; and the progress of the
Commission and local jurisdictions in
implementing the Plan. The Commission may
amend the Plan based upon its comprehensive
review, subject to the following amendment
process.

Amendments Require 2/3rd
Support of the Commission

The Plan may be amended to provide for the
use of additional federal, state or local
revenues, to account for unexpected
revenues, to take into consideration unfore-
seen circumstances or respond to a
comprehensive review. An amendment must
be adopted by a two-thirds vote of the
Commission acting as both the Commission
and the Local Transportation Authority. The
public and all jurisdictions in the County will
be given a minimum of 45 days to comment
on any proposed amendment.

Matching Funds

Leveraging matching funds from federal,
state and local sources is strongly encouraged
and incentivized by the Plan. Any sales tax
funds made available through replacement
by matching funds will be allocated to
another project or program of the same type
as outlined in the Plan and shall not be
diverted to any other use.

Project and Program Financing

“Pay as you go” is the preferred method of
financing transportation improvements and
operations under the Plan. However, the
Commission may and is authorized to use
bond financing as an alternative method if
the scope and timing of planned expenditures
makes “pay as you go” infeasible. If used,
bonds will be repaid with the proceeds of the
sales tax. Costs associated with bonding,
including interest payments, will be borne
only by the capital projects or programs in
the Plan that utilize bond proceeds. All costs
and risks associated with bonding will be
presented in the Commission’s strategic plan
and subject to public comment before any
bond sale is approved.

12

AUDITS & ANNUAL
SPENDING REVIEW

All funds will be subject to an annual audit,
and all expenditures will be reviewed annually
by a Taxpayer Oversight Committee.

Taxpayer Oversight Committee

The Taxpayer Oversight Committee will have
the responsibility to review and oversee all
expenditures of sales tax funds under the
Plan. The Committee reports directly to the
public and has the following responsibilities:

•	Hold public hearings and issue reports on
at least an annual basis to inform Ventura
County residents about how sales tax
funds are being spent. Meetings and hear-
ings of the full Committee will be open to
the public and subject to the Brown Act
open meeting law.

•	The Committee will have full access to
the Commission’s independent auditor
and will have the authority to request and
review specific information regarding the
use of sales tax funds and to comment on
the auditor’s reports.

•	The Committee will have access to all
sales tax audit reports prepared for
local jurisdictions who receive sales tax
allocations under the Plan.

•	The Taxpayer Oversight Committee will
prepare an annual report on spending and
progress in implementing the Plan, and
will make an annual finding, published
and given broad distribution through-
out Ventura County, as to whether the
Commission is proceeding in accordance
with the Plan. •

•	Taxpayer Oversight Committee
members will be private citizens who are
not elected or appointed officials at any
level of government, nor public employees
from agencies that either oversee or
benefit from the proceeds of the sales tax.
Membership is limited to individuals who
live in Ventura County. Members will be
required to submit an annual statement
of financial disclosure, and membership

is restricted to those with no economic
interest in any of the Plan’s projects or
programs.

•	Each city and the County of Ventura
shall solicit and appoint a member of the
public from its jurisdictional boundaries
to the Committee. Appointees should
have expertise in one of the following
areas: accounting, active transportation,
construction, environmental sciences,
engineering, finance, mobility, public
transit, or project management. Terms
of service will be four (4) years with no
appointee serving more than two terms.

Commitments from Fund Recipients

•	All local jurisdictions receiving funds
under the Plan for transit, roads, highways,
bicycle and pedestrian improvements,
goods movement, and environmental
enhancements must expend funds
expeditiously and report annually on
completed or committed expenditures
and any future planned expenditures.

The reports will be made available to the
public.

•	All recipients of funds allocated under
the Plan will be required to sign a Master
Funding Agreement which details their
role and responsibilities in spending the
funds. Funding agreements will include
performance and accountability measures,
and recipients will be required to have an
annual audit conducted by an independent
CPA to ensure that funds are managed
and spent in accordance with the require-
ments of the Plan and Master Funding
Agreement.

Annual Budget and Strategic Plan

Each year the Commission will adopt an
annual budget that projects expected sales
tax receipts, other anticipated revenues and
planned expenditures for administration,
programs and projects under the Plan. The
Commission will also prepare a strategic plan
that will identify the priority for projects, and
dates for project and/or program implemen-
tation based upon readiness, the ability to
attract matching funds and other relevant
criteria. Both the budget and the strategic
plan will be adopted at a fully noticed public
meeting of the Commission.

Impartial Analysis by County Counsel*

Currently, Ventura County’s General Plan requires that changes to land use designations, goals and policies regarding open space,
agricultural and rural lands in the unincorporated area (lands outside city boundaries) be approved by a vote of the people at a countywide
election, with limited exceptions. Those provisions are set to expire December 31,2020. County Measure “C” is an ordinance of the County of
Ventura placed on the ballot as a result of a petition signed by the requisite number of voters which, if adopted by the voters of the County, would
extend the current voter approval requirement through 2050 and make certain other changes to the General Plan.

Under the current General Plan, until 2021 voter approval generally is required for changes to land use designations, goals or policies
that would result in more intensive development uses of open space, agricultural or rural lands. To make such a change, the board of supervisors
must conduct at least one public hearing on the suggested amendment, comply with the California Environmental Quality Act and place the
suggested amendment on the ballot. The proposed amendment would only become effective if a majority of those voters who cast ballots vote for
the change.

The current limited exceptions from the general rule of voter approval include changes to land use designations that would result in less
intensive development uses, redesignations necessary to avoid an unlawful taking of private property, and certain others.

In addition to extending the voter approval requirements of the current General Plan through 2050, Measure “C,” if approved by the
voters, would make the following changes to the General Plan, among others: (1) eliminate voter approval requirements for land use
redesignations needed to comply with state housing laws for all economic segments of the community (e.g., for low and very low income housing);
(2) eliminate voter approval requirements for redesignations of up to 12 acres of land countywide for processing of locally grown food; (3) delete
"irrigated” from the definition of agricultural lands; (4) add a goal to promote infrastructure for farmworker housing; (5) add a goal to encourage
Land Conservation Act contracts on farming, grazing and open space lands; (6) designate Thomas Aquinas College as an Existing Community;
and (7) amend Existing Community policies by expanding the types of zones that can be recognized beyond residential, commercial or industrial.

The measure’s provisions, if approved by the voters, would remain in effect through 2050, unless repealed earlier by the voters. After
December 31,2050, any General Plan changes may be made without a vote of the people.

If the provisions of two ordinances adopted at the same election conflict, the ordinance receiving the highest number of affirmative votes
will control.

Argument in Favor of Measure C

There are two measures on the November ballot dealing with SOAR, the law that protects Ventura County from urban sprawl.

Measure C was written by the supporters of SOAR, a grassroots coalition that is working to extend SOAR and preserve open space and farmland
in the County. Measure F was funded by opponents of SOAR, big landholders and wealthy developers who want to weaken our protections.

SOAR's Measure C has a proven 20-year track record of effectively protecting open space and agricultural land from development and maintaining
the local agricultural economy and jobs. In contrast, Measure F’s vaguely worded loopholes hide the agenda of the developers who are funding
the campaign. Measure F will allow the conversion of thousands of acres of open space and agricultural land into urban development, creating
Los Angeles style sprawl.

SOAR’s Measure C requires a vote of the people before open space and agricultural land can be rezoned for development, making it impossible
for politicians, developers and special interests to push through a project that is opposed by the public.

In contrast, Measure F reduces Ventura County residents’ right to vote, giving politicians the ability to rezone open space and agricultural land for
major development projects with no public accountability.

SOAR’s Measure C 2050 is a coordinated countywide plan with voter-approved City and County initiatives that work together to protect our open
spaces._________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

N VE 001-046

Argument in Favor of Measure C (continued)

Measure F breaks that coordinated approach between county and city planning efforts making it harder for local voters to protect their
communities from piecemeal urban sprawl. Measure F’s disjointed land use policies will lead to traffic congestion and overcrowding like we see in
the San Fernando Valley.

Finally, Measure F’s poison pill provision invalidates SOAR’s Measure C.

That’s why a broad grassroots coalition including SOAR, the Nature Conservancy, the Audubon Society and the Sierra Club urge you to vote YES
ON MEASURE C and NO ON MEASURE F.

Rebuttal to Argument in Favor of Measure C

The career politicians who are REALLY behind Measure C are nervous. How else can you explain the distortions, half-truths, and outright lies
they’re telling about Measure C and Measure F?

Here’s what you need to know about these measures:

FARMERS wrote Measure F. Farmers are the “big landowners” attacked by Measure C proponents. All they want is to preserve agricultural land
from being sold for development.

CAREER POLITICIANS wrote Measure C. Their plan with Measure C is to maintain control over all important Ventura County decisions for
another 34 years. They don't care whether farming is successful in Ventura County or not. They just want to be in charge.

So don’t pay attention to the people they got to sign their ballot argument above. Official documents at the Ventura County Elections Office show
that career politicians control the PAC backing Measure C.

Here is the TRUTH about Measure C and Measure F:

Both Measure C and Measure F contain the EXACT SAME requirement that voters must approve any rezoning of agricultural land or open space
for development.

A reporter from the Ventura County Star said both Measure C and Measure F help stop urban sprawl. But Measure C stops there.

Measure C does nothing to help farmers deal with the drought.

Measure C does nothing to help keep local food processing jobs here in Ventura County.

Don’t believe the career politicians or scare tactics. If you want to preserve Ag land and keep farmers farming in Ventura County, vote No on C and
Yes on F!

Argument Against Measure C

Local family farmers, small business owners, labor and taxpayer groups urge you to vote NO on Measure C!

Measure C was drafted by career politicians and lawyers who are NOT interested in protecting farmland in Ventura County.

The career politicians behind Measure C are interested in one thing and one thing only, protecting their political power.

The backers of Measure C went out of their way to ensure it does NOTHING to help farmers in Ventura County. IN FACT, the backers of Measure
C sat down with local representatives of agriculture, heard their requests, and then specifically did not include proposals from these farmers to help
family farms.

Measure C doesn’t help farmers deal with the drought; that means more fallowed farmland under Measure C.

Measure C doesn't help farmers keep local food processing local; that means more trucks on our freeways, and fewer local jobs.

THESE ARE THE FACTS. If you want to protect agricultural land and open space in Ventura County, and stop sprawl, then local farms must be
economically viable. Measure C does nothing to help local farmers.

Just in the last year, three major, local farms went out of business, costing us over 1,000 jobs. These now closed farms can be targeted for
development votes under Measure C.

Instead of helping family farmers, Measure C locks in the same agriculture policies we’ve had in Ventura County since the 1980s, and extends
them until 2050.

Your car is not the same as it was in the 1980s. Your phone is definitely not the same as it was in the 1980s. And farming today is different than it
was in the 80s.

But the backers of Measure C want farmers to live under the rules from the 80s. That makes no sense.

Help local family farmers, small businesses, labor and taxpayer groups. Say No to the career politicians.

Vote No on Measure C!

Rebuttal to Argument Against Measure C

The arguments by the opponents of SOAR do not make common sense.

Career politicians trying to keep their power wouldn’t write a measure that gave away that power. Yet that's what the authors of SOAR did, they
gave voters the power to approve or reject urban sprawl projects.

Measure C empowers voters to decide Ventura County's future land use. Measure F decreases voters' right to control that future.

SOAR has a proven 20-year record of protecting farmland while agricultural land values and production have risen steadily to record levels.

The agricultural economy is strong under SOAR. New farm operations immediately replace departing ones because of high demand for farmland.

SOAR's Measure C better protects agriculture because SOAR doesn’t exempt thousands of acres of agricultural land from a vote of the people,
like Measure F does.

Rebuttal to Argument Against Measure C (continued)

It is plain false to claim SOAR does not support local food production when SOAR's Measure C was the first land use measure in Ventura County
to introduce support for farmworker housing and local food processing.

Finally, SOAR’s opponents ignore that Measure F will leave our county with disjointed land use policies that are not coordinated with the important
City SOAR measures. If you SUPPORT YOUR CITY SOAR, YOU SHOULD ALSO SUPPORT MEASURE C.

We TRUST the grassroots citizens that back Measure C and the coordinated companion City SOAR Measures, much more than the leaders of the
most powerful development forces in Ventura County who back Measure F.

Join us in voting Yes on SOAR’s Measure C and No on Measure F.

Argument in Favor of Measure F

To KEEP FARMERS FARMING, Vote YES on Measure F.

Measure F was written by local, family farmers, not career politicians.

The authors of Measure F come from families who have farmed Ventura County collectively for OVER 400 YEARS!

You can trust them when they say that if you want to protect agricultural land and open space in Ventura County, and stop urban sprawl, Vote Yes
on Measure F!

Measure F KEEPS the current Ventura County requirement that voters should have a say before any agricultural land or open space is rezoned
for development.

But it goes beyond that by adding priorities to County policy to help family farms stay viable and not a target for development. These include:
Promote water infrastructure - so farmers can develop local sources of water to help combat the drought.____________________________________________

N VE 001-050

Argument in Favor of Measure F (continued)

Allow limited local food processing on the farm - to create more local jobs and remove truck traffic shipping local farm products out of area to be
packaged and processed.

Cut unnecessary red tape - so farmers can farm, not process government paperwork.

Local, strong, economically viable family farms are one of the most important factors making Ventura County a great place to live.

When they are successful, local family farms provide the greatest protection against overdevelopment, and provide natural open and green space
that can’t be targeted for sprawl.

But farms in Ventura County are under tremendous pressure; from the drought, international competition, and invasive pests. Just this year, three
major Ventura County farms closed, costing over 1,000 local jobs.

And when a local farm fails, it can be targeted for development. Don’t let that happen anymore.

All local farmers want to do is keep farming. Measure F helps keep our local farms strong, so they are never tempted to close the farm and sell to
developers.

Trust the family farmers who wrote Measure F. Yes on Measure F!

Rebuttal to Argument in Favor of Measure F

Measure F IS NOT the family farmer effort they claim. It's a well-funded campaign by large landowners who can profit more from urban
development than farming.

They have the money and connections to create the illusion that Measure F is designed to “help” family farmers, but the “help” Measure F provides
is helping large landowners develop their farmland.

THESE ARE THE FACTS: A head of the largest land use engineering firm in Ventura County, a developer of a 1500-unit subdivision and a
landowner who proposed developing 4,000 acres of Ventura County open space are major funders of Measure F.

Corporate landholders support Measure F because its loopholes allow thousands of acres of urban sprawl development without voter approval.

For example, one unclear loophole in Measure F allows large-scale development of farmland “adjacent” to school sites without size restrictions or
clarity on how far the exemption can be stretched.

It is no surprise that campaign disclosure reports show major funding for Measure F is coming from large landowner-developers who would benefit
from this vaguely written loophole.

Measure F’s poison pill language against SOAR's Measure C shows its hidden anti-SOAR agenda (Section 5, Measure F).

SOAR has a proven 20-year track record of effectively protecting open space and agricultural land from development. With SOAR, agricultural
land and crop production values have risen to record levels, maintaining the local agricultural economy and jobs.

Join us in voting NO on the ANTI-SOAR Measure F funded by big landowners and developers, and YES on SOAR Measure C, funded by
grassroots residents.

Measure F weakens SOAR by reducing Ventura County residents’ right to vote, giving politicians the ability to rezone open space and agricultural
land for major development projects with no public accountability.

Measure F also brings an early end to your right to vote, cutting it off in 2036. By contrast, Measure C extends you right to vote until 2050.

Measure F ends SOAR’s coordinated countywide plan that protects our county from urban sprawl. Measure F FAILS to coordinate with any of the
City SOAR initiatives. It breaks SOAR’s coordinated approach between a county and city planning effort making it harder for local voters to protect
their communities from piecemeal urban sprawl.

Measure F’s disjointed land use policies will lead to traffic congestion and overcrowding like we see in the San Fernando Valley.
