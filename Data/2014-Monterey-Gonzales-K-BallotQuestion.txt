Ballot question

The question on the ballot appeared as:[i]

To protect essential services, such as public safety and street and park
repairs, initiate work on desired facilities like the community center and
pool, continue the development of innovative programs for economic
growth and youth, adult and senior activities, and address unanticipated
debt, shall Gonzales enact a one-half percent (.50%) transactions and use
tax, for ten (10) years, reviewed by a citizen’s oversight committee and
annual independent audit, for use exclusively in Gonzales? [2]
