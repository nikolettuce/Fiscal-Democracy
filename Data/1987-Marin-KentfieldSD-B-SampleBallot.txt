ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE B

MEASURE B IS FOR THE CHILDREN
Many people have chosen to live in our school district because of the quality of our local schools.
Br ' Elementary School and Kent Middle School are well-managed and have received numerous
lo nd state educational awards.

The excellence of the educational programs in turn has raised our property values. Families moving
into our community have elected to pay higher prices for their homes in order to send their children
to Bacich and Kent.

But now. this excellence is in jeopardy

California ranks in the bottom half of the 50 states in expenditure per student for education and dead
last among all industrial states. The Kentfield School District faces a projected deficit of $314,000 to
continue the existing educational program for the coming school year, counting all projected sources
pL;;State ;incpme,:;;:i

Measure B is desperately needed to establish a reliable source of funding to maintain our schools'
educational programs. Measure B will permit an annual assessment of property owners within the
Kentfield School District limited to $97 per parcel ($48.50 per semi-annual payment). It will expire
after 5 years.

Property owners age 65 and over will be exempt from the tax for their primary residence and will not
need to pay this tax. Property owners applying once for the exemption will not be required to apply
again so long as they continue to own the property and to use it as their primary residence

Measure B will benefit all of us. The excellence of our schools adds to the appeal of our community
and maintains our property values.

The children of our community need our suppport. The education they receive today lays the
foundation for responsible citizenship in the future
