' ’’GUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASUR

Do you realize as a Pacifica citizen and taxpayer that most of the time there
are only 2 firefighters in a station to respond to fire ani medical
emergencies? Do you realize that you are regularly protected at] times by
only 3 police officers on the streets? This in fact vas the staffing level
for emergency services before the Landscape and Lighting tax was eliminated.
Since its elimination, Fire and Police positions have been cut, add further
reductions have been proposed, despite recent campaign assurances that Public
Safety would not be affected by politics.

I

Pacifica is the fifth largest city in the County in population and .area. It
ranks sixth highest in household income. And yet Pacifica spends the least
amount per capita in the County by far for fire and police protection and all
other city services. Per capita staffing levels for police are well below
the County average, and the lowest for fire, both below all recognised safety
standards. Any further reductions will, seriously compromise the
effectiveness of police and fire operations, and will endanger the lives of
citizens as well as public safety employees.	;

The recent loss of funds from higher levels of government makes it imperative
that local revenue sources be maintained. The Utility User's taxi (in place
for 10 years) is a fair tax averaging $5 per household a month, yet exempts
agisd, disabled/* or low income persons. It provides essential dollars that
hgve a direct tfenefit to you. It helps maintain minimum levels oJ{ fire and
pblice protection and other vital city services as well as valued human
service programs that keep our City and its quality of life intact. Please
vote "yes" on MEASURE g.
