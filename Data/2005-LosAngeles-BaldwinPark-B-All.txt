The City of Baldwin Park currently imposes a tax upon every person who
occupies a hotel room within the City (unless the person is exempt from tax
under the law). The tax rate is ten percent (10%) of the rental rate for the hotel
room. The tax is collected by the operator of the hotel and sent to the City, which
then may use the revenue for any general municipal purpose. This is referred to
as a transient occupancy tax. This measure will raise the rate of the transient
occupancy tax to eleven percent (11%) on January 1, 2006, and then to twelve
percent (12%) on January 1, 2008. The additional revenue raised may also be
spent for any general municipal purpose.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE B

This is NOT A NEW TAX and it is NOT PAID BY YOU unless you register as a
guest at Baldwin Park hotels/motels. This tax is PAID ONLY BY VISITORS (who
are generally non Baldwin Park residents) who stay in hotels and motels in
Baldwin Park.

Measure B will increase the City’s existing Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) also
known as hotel/motel/bed tax from 10% to 11% effective January 1, 2006 and to
12% effective January 1, 2008.

The City uses tax dollars to provide essential programs and services that benefit
YOU, community members and visitors, for example:

MAINTAINING public parks and providing quality recreational programs;
PROVIDING police protection;

REPAIRING and maintaining streets;

PROMOTING economic development, which creates jobs and continued growth
and beautification in your City.

Transient Occupancy Tax is a very common way by which visitors contribute to
local services, as you do when you stay at hotels in other cities such as
Sacramento, Las Vegas or San Diego.

Your YES vote will allow the City to receive additional revenues to improve
services and promote growth and development in the City of Baldwin Park.

PLEASE VOTE YES ON MEASURE B!
