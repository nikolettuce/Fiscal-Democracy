MEASURE E2012
City of Carpinteria
IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY

(Transient Occupancy Tax - Amendment to Carpinteria Municipal Code
3,20.030)

Measure E2012 is a proposed ordinance to amend Chapter 3,20 of the
City of Carpinteria Municipal Code pertaining to the City's hotel bed tax
(transient occupancy tax). The amendment would increase the City’s
transient occupancy tax rate from 10% to 12%. The 12% rate would
become effective on January 1, 2013.

The transient occupancy tax is charged only to persons occupying
hotels and other structures falling within the definition of a "hotel" as
defined in Carpinteria Municipal Code Chapter 3.20 for 30 consecutive
days or less. A "hotel" means any structure, or any portion of any
structure, which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy for
dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes and includes any hotel, inn,
tourist home or house, motel, and other structures, The person
occupying the hotel is currently charged a tax in the amount of 10% of
the rent charged by the operator of the hotel. The tax is considered a
debt owed to the City. The tax has remained at a rate of 10% since
1991.

The operator of the hotel collects the tax from the guest and then remits
the tax to the City. As an example of the effect of this Measure, a guest
who is charged $100 for a one night stay in a hotel room currently pays
$10 to the City for the transient occupancy tax. If this Measure is
approved, a guest would be required to pay $12 in tax for that same
$100 room.

This Measure proposes a general tax as defined in the California
Constitution. The revenues from the tax are placed into the City's
general fund to be used for any lawful purpose of the City. The City
anticipates that it may use such revenues to help support a variety of
services, including but not limited to street/pothole repair, park
maintenance, tourism promotion/economic vitality, law enforcement,
youth and senior programs, and other City services. Revenues from the
tax are not designated for any particular purpose.

If this Measure is approved, the City Council may repeal the rate
increase, reduce the rate below 12%, or, if reduced below that rate,
increase the rate back to 12%, all without further voter approval, The
City Council, however, may not increase the transient occupancy tax
rate above 12% unless the voters approve such increase by vote,

A “Yes" vote on this Measure is a vote in favor of increasing the
transient occupancy tax from 10% to 12%. A "No" vote on this Measure
is a vote to maintain the transient occupancy tax at the current rate of
10%. This Measure will be adopted if it is approved by a majority of
voters voting on it.

A copy of this Measure and related materials are available on the City's
website at www.carpinteria.ca.us.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure E2012. If
you desire a copy of the Measure, please call the Carpinteria City
Clerk’s Office at (805)684-5405 ext. 403 and a copy will be mailed at
no cost to you.

Isl Peter N. Brown, City Attorney

MEASURE E2012
City of Carpinteria
ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE

Yes on Measure E is an EASY choice! Measure E will provide much
needed revenue to support City services, including services used by
visitors and that help promote tourism. Costs for street and park
maintenance, law enforcement, the library, and many other services are
paid by local residents, but are also enjoyed by visitors to Carpinteria.
The hotel bed tax is paid by guests staying in hotels and motels.
Measure E therefore is an opportunity to increase needed revenue
without increasing taxes on local residents.

A vote in favor of this measure will increase the hotel bed tax rate from
10% to 12%, and is expected to generate approximately $250,000
annually to help maintain basic City services and provide opportunities
for enhancing certain services. Because revenue from Measure E
cannot be taken by the state, 100% of these funds will be used to pay
for City services.

Measure E is an important part of the City's response to the economic
recession that has included no increases in taxes on local residents,
minimizing cuts in municipal services, supporting growth in the local
economy, providing youth and senior services, and maintaining healthy
reserves.

The hotel bed tax rate has not changed since 1991. The City of Santa
Barbara already has a 12% rate, and the cities of Goleta, Buellton and
Solvang are asking voters to increase their respective hotel bed tax
rates to 12%.

The proposed hotel bed tax increase is fair, reasonable, and necessary
to ensure the long-term financial health of the City and the continuation
of important City services. High quality City services help make
Carpinteria a tourist destination for people from throughout California
and around the world. Yes on Measure E is an EASY choice to help
keep Carpinteria a great place to live, work, and visit!

The undersigned authors of the argument in favor of Measure E2012 at
the General Election for the City of Carpinteria to be held on November
6, 2012 hereby state that this argument is true and correct to the best of
their knowledge and belief.

MEASURE H2012
City of Goleta

GOLETA TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY

If Measure H is approved by a majority of the voters of the City of
Goleta, the Goleta Municipal Code will be amended to allow collection
of a transient occupancy tax at the rate of twelve percent (12%) of rent
on hotel guests staying within the City. This tax is also known as a bed
tax or "TOT1. Currently, the City imposes a ten percent (10%) transient
occupancy tax.

Revenue generated from the tax will not be restricted and will be
available for the City Council to expend on any (awful City purpose.

The above statement Is an impartial analysis of Measure H. If you
desire a copy of the measure please call the Goleta City Clerk’s
Office at 961-7505 and a copy will be mailed at no cost to you.

MEASURE H2012
City of Goleta
ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE

Yes on Measure H will provide Goleta with additional funding to
enhance city services such as public safety, road maintenance, and
revitalization efforts in Old Town. Measure H will increase the transient
occupancy tax (TOT) “bed tax” paid by hotel guests visiting Goleta from
10% to 12%. This increase will provide the City with funding to help
maintain the high quality of services our community enjoys.

Unlike most other taxes, the bed tax is collected locally and the State
cannot take this revenue away from Goleta. 100% of these funds
remain in Goleta to protect critical funding for:

•	Current levels of police officers and traffic patrols

•	Repairs to our streets, potholes and sidewalks

•	Revitalization efforts in Old Town

•	Preserving the quality of our parks, open spaces and
community services

•	Providing visitor services and economic development
opportunities

Goleta's hotel tax rate has not been changed since 1990. The City of
Santa Barbara is at a rate of 12%, and the cities of Carpinteria, Buellton
and Solvang are asking voters to increase their respective bed tax rates
to 12%.

Based an the current revenue sharing agreement with the County of
Santa Barbara, the City's financial situation remains challenging.
Property tax is the number one revenue generator for Goleta. However
we will continue to share 50% of property and 30% of sales tax revenue
with the County - in perpetuity.

Yes on Measure H includes taxpayer protections requiring independent
financial audits and yearly reports to keep the City accountable for how
these funds are used. This measure is estimated to generate $900,000
per year.

Many residents live in Goleta because it offers a high level of service,
programs, and quality of life. Join us in voting YES on Measure H to
ensure Goleta remains a quality community.

The undersigned authors of the argument in favor of Measure H2012 at
the General Election for the City of Goleta to be held on November 6,
2012 hereby state that this argument is true and correct to the best of
their knowledge and belief.
