ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE L

Dear Voters of Rescue Fire Protection District:

Due to the continuing increase in population and budgetary restraints, we
need your help to maintain and upgrade your fire district services by reinstat-
ing Measure “L".

It’s our intent to provide manpower to upgrade the tire and medical protection
you expect. Additional personnel can keep response times to a minimum, by
supporting the existing volunteer organization with additional, qualified paid
personnel - 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Measure "L” funds are to
be used for no other purposes.

Measure “L”, will appear on the ballot essentially as follows:

“Shall a special tax providing funds for 24 hour, paid firefighter protection in
the Rescue Fire Protection District at an annual established rate of $50.00 per
parcel be assessed beginning January 1, 1991"?

Thank you for the support you have given us in the past. Because of your
support Station #2 has been built, 2 new engines purchased and equipped,
and the land for Station #3 acquired.

June 5, 1990, we ask for your support again. Your YES vote on Measure
“L”, will help us protect and serve you. Thank you for your time and support!

Sincerely,
s/ James Hawkins. President
Rescue Volunteer Firemen’s Association
