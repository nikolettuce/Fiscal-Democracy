Lake County Fire Protection District

ORDINANCE REPEALING LAKESHORE FIRE PROTECTION
DISTRICT ORDINANCE NO. 0197 AND LOWER LAKE FIRE
PROTECTION DISTRICT ORDINANCE NO. 96-97-2 AND
IMPOSING A SPECIAL TAX INCREASE FOR FIRE PROTECTION
AND PREVENTION, RESCUE, EMERGENCY MEDICAL
SERVICES AND TRANSPORTATION, HAZARDOUS MATERIAL,
AND OTHER SERVICES RELATING TO THE PROTECTION
OF LIVES AND PROPERTY

ORDINANCE NO: 2016-1001

The Board of Directors of the Lake County Fire Protection District does ordain as
follows:

SECTION 1. AUTHORITY

Section 4 of Article XIIIA of the California Constitution permits special districts by
two-thirds vote of their qualified electorate to impose a special tax on property.
Health and Safety Code Section 13913 authorizes a fire protection district to im-
pose a special tax pursuant to Government Code Section 53978 for fire protection
and prevention services.

SECTION 2. PURPOSE AND INTENT

It is the purpose of this Ordinance to authorize the levy of a special tax on parcels of
real property on the secured property tax rolls of Lake County that are within the
Lake County Fire Protection District and to expend the revenues therefrom, in or-
der to augment funding for fire protection and prevention, rescue, emergency med-
ical services and transportation, hazardous material, and other services relating to
the protection of lives and property. This special tax shall repeal existing 1997 spe-
cial tax for Lakeshore Fire Protection District and Lower Lake Fire Protection Dis-
trict.

The net revenues raised by this tax are to be used solely for the purposes of obtain-
ing, furnishing, operating and maintaining fire suppression and emergency medical
equipment or apparatus, for paying the salaries and benefits of firefighting and
emergency medical personnel, and for other necessary fire protection and preven-
tion, rescue, emergency medical services and transportation, hazardous material,
and other services relating to the protection of lives and property.

Because the burden of this falls on property, it is a property tax, but is not deter-
mined according to nor is it in any manner passed on the value of the property. This
tax is based, to the extent practical, upon the risk of fire or emergency services and
the need for services to each parcel and the improvements thereon. Insofar as not

inconsistent with this Ordinance, such provisions of the California Revenue and
Taxation Code as related to ad valorem property taxes are intended to apply to the
collection and administration of this tax. As authorized by Government Code Sec-
tion 53978, this tax is not an ad valorem tax; the exemptions contained in or autho-
rized by Article XIII of the California Constitution shall not apply.

SECTION 3. DEFINITIONS

The following definitions shall apply throughout this Ordinance:

1.	“Parcel” means the land and improvements thereon, designated by a parcel
number on an assessor’s parcel map and carried on the secured property tax
roll of Lake County. For purposes of this Ordinance, parcel does not include any
land or improvements outside the boundaries of the Lake County Fire Protec-
tion District.

2.	“Developed Parcel” means any parcel upon which an improvement exists.

3.	“Improvement” means those items included within Revenue and Taxation Code
Section 105 definition of improvements, except for:

a)	Fences, poles and walls that are not a part of or connected to a structure; and

b)	Trees and vines

4.	“Year” or “Fiscal Year” means the period of July 1 through the following June 30.

5.	“Taxpayer” means the assessee of the property shown on the secured tax roll or
the person or legal entity actually paying the tax, if different from the assessee.

6.	“District” means the Lake County Fire Protection District.

SECTION 4. SPECIAL TAX & TAX RATE

The Board of Directors of the Lake County Fire Protection District is authorized to
levy a special tax, for the purpose as specified in Section 2, on each parcel of real
property located within the boundaries of the District at a rate not to exceed $4.00
per benefit unit for the first year and is to be adjusted each year thereafter by the
change in the consumer price index. Provided that if at any time the consumer
price index resulted in anything less than zero, the special tax rate would remain at
the previous year’s rate in an effort to maintain the current level of services. How-
ever provided, that such a special tax shall not be imposed upon property of a fed-
eral, state or local government agency.

The special tax shall be imposed in accordance with the schedule for Units of Ben-
efit attached hereto as Exhibit A. Each land use within a parcel is subject to Units of
Benefit computation and the total of all uses on a parcel shall be computed to be
the tax due to the District.

SECTION 5. SETTING THE TAX RATE

At a regularly scheduled Board Meeting in May of each year, the Board of Directors
will set the tax rate for the next fiscal year by adoption of resolution, not to exceed
the amount per benefit unit as set forth in Section 4 above.

SECTION 6. COLLECTION

The special tax shall constitute a lien against each parcel for which the tax is col-
lected in accordance with Revenue and Taxation Code Section 2187.

The County of Lake shall be charged with the collection of this tax and shall deduct
the reasonable costs incurred by the County from the taxes collected.

SECTION 7. SEVERABILITY

If any section, subsection, sentence, phrase or clause of this Ordinance is for any
reason held to be invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining
portions of this Ordinance. The Directors of the District hereby declare that they
would have adopted the Ordinance and each section despite the fact that any one
or more sections, subsections, phrases or clauses be declared invalid.

17D1

SECTION 8. EFFECTIVE DATE

This Ordinance shall take effect for the 2017/2018 fiscal year for parcels with a lien
date of January 1,2017, upon its approval and confirmation of two-thirds of the reg-
istered voters in the District.

SECTION 13. ADOPTION

All Ordinances or parts of Ordinances, Resolutions or parts of Resolutions in con-
flict herewith are hereby repealed to the extent of such conflict and no further.

This Ordinance before the expiration of fifteen days after its passage shall be pub-
lished at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the County of Lake.

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF LAKE COUNTY FIRE
PROTECTION DISTRICT MEASURE “D”

Pursuant to Government Code Section 53978, the Lake County Fire Protection
District has adopted Ordinance Number 2016-1001, an ordinance imposing a spe-
cial tax increase for fire protection and prevention, emergency medical, and other
related services. A 2/3 vote is required for the approval of this special tax prior to it
becoming effective.

This measure, placed on the ballot by the Lake County Fire Protection District, sub-
mits Ordinance Number 2016-1001 for voter approval. Approval by 2/3 of the vot-
ers voting on the measure would authorize a special tax on parcels of real property
in the Lake County Fire Protection District to be used for the costs of funding fire
protection and prevention, rescue, emergency medical services, transportation,
hazardous material services, and other services relating to the protection of lives
and property within the Lake County Fire Protection District. State law requires
that the proceeds of a special tax may be used only for the purposes specified and
for no other purpose.

This special tax would be levied on each parcel of real property located within the
Lake County Fire Protection District at a rate not to exceed $4.00 per benefit unit
for the first year, adjusted each year thereafter only in accordance with increases
in the consumer price index. The number of units of benefit applicable to the real
property subject to the proposed tax is as set forth in Exhibit A of Ordinance Num-
ber 2016-1001. This special tax would repeal and replace an existing 1997 special
tax for the Lakeshore Fire Protection District and Lower Lake Fire Protection Dis-
trict.

The special tax will be listed as a separate item on the county property tax bill for
each affected parcel of land, and will be collected in the same way as the general
property tax.

A “YES” vote is a vote to authorize the special tax provided in the measure.

A “NO” vote is a vote against the special tax provided in the measure.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF
MEASURE“D”

By voting yes on Measure “D”, you have an opportunity to make a lasting change in
the health and well being of our community. As an independent special district, we
are NOT funded by any county or other public entity. The current special parcel tax
has not increased in 19 years. The gap between our funding and the actual cost of
services continues to widen year after year. Our community’s demographics pre-
vent us from fully recovering our costs through ambulance billings. Our fire district
has more calls for service than any other fire district in the county. We do not have
the staffing needed to maintain such a high call volume, nor do we meet the na-
tional standards for staffing at our current call volume. We need your help.

•	Measure “D” will bridge the current gap between our funding and the actual cost
of services.

•	Measure “D” will allow us to hire additional personnel to staff the Lower Lake Fire
Station 24 hours with personnel capable of responding to any emergent need.

•	Measure “D” will add an annual cost of living increase so the District will no longer
lose funding to inflation.

•	Measure “D” will set the special parcel tax rate at an equal amount for all commu-
nities the District serves.

We ask you to approve an increase in the special parcel tax that supports the Lake
County Fire Protection District, which is the foundation of our emergency response
services. Without this increase, we will be forced to re-organize, which could in-
clude eliminating or limiting emergency medical services and programs and/or var-
ious other community services we so proudly provide. Voting YES will ensure
continued reliable, effective, and fully funded emergency response.
