Re:	City	of	Hanford	Nov. 4, 2014 Election - City of Hanford Sales Tax Measure

Impartial Analysis

Dear Sir or Madam:

Below is the impartial analysis from our office as City Attorney for the City of Hanford in
reference to the City of Hanford’s Sales Tax Measure referenced above. Please let us know if you
have any questions.

The proposed tax measure increases sales tax within the City of Hanford by 1%

(one cent for every dollar spent). Funds generated by the additional revenue will be
allocated to the General Fund, where the City Council can choose to allocate funds
for any City-related purpose or place funds into reserve accounts. Public oversight of
the expenditure of the additional tax money will occur through the City’s budget
process, as well as a citizen oversight committee who can review the auditing of the
funds generated by the measure as well as make recommendations to the City
Council. The measure is set to automatically expire in twenty (20) years. The
measure was placed on the ballot by the Hanford City Council.

Sincerely,

GRISWOLD, LaSALLE, COBB,

DOWD & GIN, LLP

ORDINANCE NO._______________

AN ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF HANFORD
IMPOSING A TRANSACTIONS AND USE TAX TO BE
ADMINISTERED BY THE STATE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION

WHEREAS, the City wishes to continue to address service priorities that the public has
identified such as investigating violent crimes, such as rape and domestic violence, maintaining
neighborhood police patrols across the City, and improving police and fire protection; and,

WHEREAS, Hanford’s population has more than doubled in the past three decades, but its
budget for essential services like police, fire and street maintenance has not kept pace; and,

WHEREAS, additional, locally-controlled funding will help the City adequately provide the
essential services residents all rely on, for a growing population that’s putting ever-increasing
demands on the City; and,

WHEREAS, gangs and crimes related to the sale and use of drugs like heroin and meth are a
growing problem in Hanford, particularly after the ongoing State releases put more than 200 new
parolees in the City; and,

WHEREAS, additional funding will help the City improve and expand gang suppression and
prevention programs and crack down on drug dealing and drug-related crimes; and,

WHEREAS, Hanford has less than half the number of firefighters recommended for a City
of its population, slowing response times and limiting the Department’s ability to plan for
disasters and conduct fire safety inspections; and,

WHEREAS, additional funding will help the City hire more firefighters to help save lives;
and,

WHEREAS, Hanford’s budget is currently millions of dollars short of what it needs to
properly maintain its 216 miles of city streets; and,

WHEREAS, nearly half of Hanford’s streets are rated as “poor” or worse; and,

WHEREAS, without additional funding, Hanford’s streets will continue to deteriorate and
future road repairs will only become more expensive;

The following shall be added to the Hanford Municipal Code, Title 3:

3.52.010. TITLE. This ordinance shall be known as the 2014 Sales Tax Measure,
Transactions and Use Tax Ordinance. The City of Hanford hereinafter shall be called "City."
This ordinance shall be applicable in the incorporated territory of the City.

3.52.020. OPERATIVE DATE. "Operative Date" means the first day of the first calendar
quarter commencing more than 110 days after the adoption of this ordinance, the date of such
adoption being as set forth below.

3.52.030.	PURPOSE.	This	ordinance	is	adopted	to	achieve	the	following,	among other

purposes, and directs that the provisions hereof' be interpreted in order to accomplish those
purposes:

A.	To impose a retail transactions and use tax in accordance with the provisions of Part 1.6
(commencing with Section 7251) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code and Section
7285.9 of Part 1.7 of Division 2 which authorizes the City to adopt this lax ordinance which shall
be operative if a majority of the electors voting on the measure vote to approve the imposition of
the tax at an election called for that purpose.

B.	To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that incorporates provisions
identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the State of California insofar as those
provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.6 of
Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.

C.	To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that imposes a tax and provides a
measure therefore that can be administered and collected by the State Board of Equalization in a
manner that adapts itself as fully as practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from,
the existing statutory and administrative procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization
in administering and collecting the California State Sales and Use Taxes.

D.	To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that can be administered in a
manner that will be, to the greatest degree possible, consistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of
Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting the transactions
and use taxes, and at the same time, minimize the burden of record keeping upon persons subject
to taxation under the provisions of this ordinance.

3.52.040. CONTRACT WITH STATE. Prior to the operative date, the City shall contract
with the State Board of Equalization to perform all functions incident to the administration and
operation of this transactions and use tax ordinance; provided, that if the City shall not have
contracted with the State Board of Equalization prior to the operative date, it shall nevertheless
so contract and in such a case the operative dale shall be the first day of the first calendar quarter
following the execution of such a contract.

3.52.050. TRANSACTIONS TAX RATE. For the privilege of selling tangible personal
properly at retail, a tax is hereby imposed upon all retailers in the incorporated territory of the

ordinance.

3.52.060. PLACE OF SALE. For the purposes of this ordinance, all retail sales are
consummated at the place of business of the retailer unless the tangible personal property sold is
delivered by the retailer or his agent to an out-of-state destination or to a common carrier for
delivery to an out-of-state destination. The gross receipts from such sales shall include delivery
charges, when such charges are subject to the state sales and use tax, regardless of the place to
which delivery is made. In the event a retailer has no permanent place of business in the State or
has more than one place of business, the place or places at which the retail sales are
consummated shall be determined under rules and regulations to be prescribed and adopted by
the State Board of Equalization.

consumption in the City of tangible personal property purchased from any retailer on and after

delivery charges when such charges are subject to state sales or use tax regardless of the place to
which delivery is made.

3.52.080. ADOPTION OF PROVISIONS OF STATE LAW. Except as otherwise
provided in this ordinance and except insofar as they are inconsistent with the provisions of Part
1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, all of the provisions of Part 1 (commencing
