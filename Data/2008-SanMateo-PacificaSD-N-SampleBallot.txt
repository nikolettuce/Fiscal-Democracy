MEASURE N

“To protect local elementary and middle schools from state budget cuts, maintain high quality education, preserve small class sizes, attract and retain
qualified teachers, protect vital academic programs and maintain classroom and school facilities, shall the Pacifica School District levy a temporary parcel
tax of $96/ year for 5 years, with independent citizen oversight, an exemption for senior citizens, no funds used for administrator salaries and all funds
staying in this community to promote student achievement?”

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE N

The California Constitution and state law authorize a school
district, upon approval of two-thirds of the voting electorate, to levy a
qualified special tax for specified purposes.

By this measure, the Board of Trustees of the Pacifica School
District proposes to levy a special tax for a period of five years beginning
July 1, 2008 and ending June 30, 2013. This tax shall be at a rate not to
exceed $96 per year per parcel on all taxable parcels in the District.

A parcel shall be defined as any unit of real property in the District
which receives a separate tax bill for ad valorem property taxes from the
San Mateo County tax collection officials. Any property owner aged 65
years or older may qualify for an exemption from the special tax if that
property owner occupies the parcel. All property which would otherwise
be exempt from property taxes will also be exempt from the imposition of
the tax.

The stated purposes of the special tax are to: maintain class sizes;
protect academic programs; attract and retain teachers; maintain
classrooms and school facilities; and continue improvements in student
achievement.

The proceeds of the special tax will be placed into a special
account. An independent citizens’ oversight committee will be established
to monitor the expenditures of the parcel tax revenues. An annual report is
required that accounts for the parcel tax revenues collected and the manner
in which they have been spent.

A “yes” vote on this measure would allow a special tax to be levied
on property within the boundaries of the Pacifica School District
for a period of five years beginning July 1, 2008 and ending June
30, 2013 in an amount up to $96 per year per taxable parcel. The
special tax would be used to: maintain class sizes; protect academic
programs; attract and retain teachers; maintain classrooms and
school facilities; and continue improvements in student
achievement.

A “no” vote on this measure would not allow the special tax to be
levied.

This measure passes if two-thirds of those voting on the measure vote
“yes.”

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE N

Our local elementary and middle schools are an important part of what makes
Pacifica such a great place to live, helping to support high property values.

Pacifica schools are among the highest-performing in the state, and
students achieve high test scores on statewide exams. Dedicated teachers
help give our kids this great education.

But state budget cuts are threatening our schools more than ever. Pacifica
schools are facing budget cuts totaling over $1 million to educational
programs. We are in danger of losing some of our best teachers. Pacifica
School District can’t rely on state funding alone to provide high-quality
education for local students.

There is only one way to keep our schools strong — local support. That is
why your Yes vote on Measure N is so important. Measure N provides stable,
guaranteed, locally controlled and audited funding, which the state can’t take.

Voting Yes on N will protect Pacifica schools by:

•	Retaining and attracting qualified teachers

•	Maintaining science and mathematics programs

•	Protecting small class sizes

•	Protecting programs that support struggling and gifted students

•	Maintaining classroom and school facilities
Measure N also protects taxpayers:

•	Measure N is local funding that will be spent here in Pacifica
schools to help students succeed

•	The state can’t take a single penny of Measure N

•	Measure N funds cannot be spent on administrator salaries

•	An independent citizen oversight committee will review and audit
spending to ensure Measure N funds are spent wisely in Pacifica
schools

•	Measure N provides an exemption for senior citizens

We can’t rely on state funding to adequately support the great education
that Pacifica students deserve. For only $8 per month, Measure N will
protect our local schools and help students continue to achieve.

Support local students and our community — please join us in voting Yes
on Measure N.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE N

•Proponents threaten to fire “some of our best teachers” if you don’t vote
for higher taxes. Nonsense! That’s childish posturing, like most of their
argument.

•If the oft-predicted budget cuts actually materialized for once, obviously
they would drop the worst performing employees. Unions object to cutting
deadweight, but it’s ultimately healthy.

•Small class sizes are not at risk. According to Ed-Data*, the District had
151 teachers, 37 paraprofessionals, and 13 pupil services employees on
staff, to operate approximately 122 classrooms.

•Politicians threaten cuts to scare voters, but 1988’s Proposition 98
guarantees schools at least 40% of the state budget, and typically they get
more.

•Even a $400 million cut would represent less than 1% of state education
spending—not exactly drastic.

•Moreover, property tax assessments automatically increase each year by
2%, and typically jump higher, when properties change hands. Property
taxes in the District doubled in the past decade, and school revenue per
student shared in the bounty, increasing by 98% in just 11 years.

•High-scoring students come from good families, not lavish school
budgets. Local student test scores pretty much proved that! Tax hikes don’t
increase property values.

•Less than 20% of California school districts have parcel taxes.

•The state can—and often does—reduce the amount of aid it gives to
districts that raise more money locally.

ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE N

Our schools are well funded.

Last year, District revenue increased for the fourth year in a row, to a record
$23.5 million—up 21% in just 4 years!

Check the facts yourself at this California Department of Education web
site:

http ://www.ed-data.kl 2.ca.us/dev/District.asp

Divide revenue by 3021 students (ADA), and you get $193.000 per
classroom of 24.9 students.

Of that amount, $72,000 was used to pay the teacher’s salary and benefits.

That left $121,000 per class for other spending, and the Board chose to
spend most of it on ancillary staff:

The District had approximately 122 classrooms, and employed 291 people,
including 30 clerical workers and 10 administrators. That’s a lot of
ancillary staff for a district with only 7 schools!

Meanwhile, many residents have real budget problems. Hitting them with
a $480 parcel tax (even stretched over 5 years) will have a painful impact
on some residents, when added to their other expenses. Paying this tax
could mean missing a critical mortgage payment, or a health insurance
premium, or drowning in credit card debt. People who carry the balance on
their credit cards could owe more than $2,000 (with interest) in just 10
years.

Vote ‘no \ The District has plenty of money, and some taxpayers don’t have
$480 to spare.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE N

Authors of the argument against Measure N don’t even live in Pacifica.

They’re using stock arguments from other places, without regard for
Pacifica schools. That’s why they’re misrepresenting facts.

The fact is, Pacifica schools boast one of the leanest administrative budgets
in the county. Pacifica’s schools emphasize great teachers, a strong
foundation in basic education and high student achievement.

Unfortunately, state budget cuts threaten this success. We need Measure N
to protect it.

Pick up any newspaper, and you’ll read about the worst education cuts in
more than a decade. State government is slashing over $1 million from
Pacifica elementary and middle schools. Our schools face cuts to key
academic programs, and we could lose some of our best teachers if
Measure N doesn’t pass.

Measure N is vital for our community and neighborhood schools. It will
help retain teachers, maintain academic programs like science and math,
and protect small class sizes.

For only $8 per month — with senior citizens exempted to ease the burden
on those with fixed incomes — Measure N will keep our schools strong and
provide stable, guaranteed funding that can’t be cut by the state.

Measure N can’t be used for administrator salaries - it provides support
where needed most: in Pacifica classrooms.

Great schools benefit all of us by supporting a safe community and strong
property values.

We can’t count on state government to take care of Pacifica’s students.

Help our kids and teachers continue to achieve—Vote Yes on Measure N.
