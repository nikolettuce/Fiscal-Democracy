TOWN ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
OF MEASURE F

If this measure is approved by a two-thirds vote, the special
tax for paramedic services administered by a Joint Powers
Authority authorized by the voters in 1982, 1986, 1991,
1994, 1998 and 2002 will be continued with a tax of $39
increasing by $3.00 per year not to exceed $48 for each liv-
ing unit, and in the amount of $39 increasing by $3.00 per
year per 1,500 square feet of structure of each developed
parcel in non-residential use, to be collected in addition to
fees for transport to the hospital charged to insurance
providers, without collection pursued against uninsured
persons. The applicable appropriations limit pursuant to
Article XIIIB of the California Constitution will be
increased in an amount equal to the proceeds of the special
tax. The special tax and die corresponding increase in the
appropriations limit expire on June 30, 2011.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE F

Since 1982, the voters in the Ross Valley have overwhelm-
ingly approved a special tax to provide paramedic service.
To continue this high standard of emergency medical care
for four more years, this measure must be re-approved.
The Ross Valley Paramedic Authority (RVPA) provides a
base level service, which includes dedicated paramedic
ambulances in the Ross Valley, 9-1-1 responses, defibrilla-
tors, the training of paramedics and Emergency Medical
Technicians, and ambulance transport to the hospital.

Your parcel tax covers the base level service, while the
transport cost is charged to the user and is billed to insur-
ance providers such as Medi-Cal, Medicare, and private
insurance carriers. This is the standard policy of all para-
medic provider agencies within Marin County.

The current parcel tax of $30.00 per parcel has been in
effect for 15 years. In order to maintain the current high
level of service our citizens deserve, it is necessary to
increase the tax. We are requesting a $9.00 increase the first
year with a potential increase of $3.00 a year for the
remaining three years. The actual increase will be deter-
mined each year.

Our goal is to insure the maintenance of our current level
of service, as well as continuously implementing improve-
ments to this high quality of life support service.

We need YOUR vote to continue this vital service. Vote
“YES” on Measure F.
