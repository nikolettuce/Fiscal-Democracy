TOWN ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
OF MEASURE B

If this measure is approved by the requisite two-thirds
vote, an ordinance shall be adopted in the Town of Corte
Madera imposing a special tax for paramedic and/or emer-
gency medical services (EMS). This is not the first time an
EMS tax has been submitted to and approved by the
Town’s voters. A special EMS tax was first approved by
the Town’s voters on June 7, 1983 and has since received
continuous voter approval. The present special EMS tax
was approved by the Town’s voters in November of 2002.
Since that tax will expire on June 30, 2007, voter approval
of this measure is required in order to continue the provi-
sion of EMS services.

If approved, this measure will impose a yearly tax for
EMS services for the next four fiscal years. For fiscal year
2007-2008, the tax amount will be $45.00 for each resi-
dential unit. For nonresidential uses, the tax rate for fiscal
year 2007-2008 will be $45.00 per 1,000 square feet of
enclosed floor area. The tax rate on residential and non-
residential uses shall increase $5.00 per year for each of
the remaining three years the tax is in effect. In fiscal year

2010-2011, the yearly tax shall be $60.00 for each resi-
dential unit and $60.00 for each 1,000 square feet of
enclosed floor area for nonresidential uses.

The measure provides that the tax proceeds must be
placed in a special fund which may only be used for the
provision of EMS services. The tax amount specified
above may not be increased without the approval of two-
thirds of the Town voters. The measure also provides that
the EMS tax will be collected by the Marin County Tax
Collector along with the property tax. As stated above, the
tax will automatically terminate on June 30, 2011.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE B

In 1983 Corte Madera joined with surrounding communi-
ties up to Fairfax in establising the Ross Valley Paramedic
Authority to provide paramedic ambulance services to the
citizens of the Ross Valley. A single ambulance was locat-
ed centrally in the Town of Ross and responded to all 911
calls. By 1997 the volume of calls had increased and the
citizens of Corte Madera were experiencing significant
delays in obtaining paramedic services. The Corte Madera
Town Council established a paramedic system in order to
provide timely paramedic services to residents of our
town. On March 1, 1998, the department responded to
their first paramedic call.

Corte Madera has a dedicated Paramedic Ambulance at
Station 13 on Paradise and has Paramedic-Firefighters
staffing an Engine Company at Station 14 on Tamalpais to
quickly respond to any medical emergency in Corte Ma-
dera. We now have the best paramedic services and short-
est response times in Marin but the Town has incurred
increased costs in funding this operation. To maintain this
vital service our staff has recognized the necessity to
increase the paramedic tax which residents authorize to
directly support this system.

Corte Madera residents have supported paramedic services
by approving this tax since 1983. It is currently at $45.00
and needs to be raised $5.00 per year over three years
beginning in FY 2008/2009 in order to be assured of being
able to continue to fund this service. At that point the rate
would be a maximum of $60.00 per year in FY 2010/2011.
This compares very favorably with current paramedic tax
rates in San Rafael and Novato and in other communities
with a Fire Department based Paramedic System. This tax
is used entirely in Corte Madera and if not passed would
result in the loss of the excellent paramedic services in our
town. Your support for this measure is greatly appreciated.
