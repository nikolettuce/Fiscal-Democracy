IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL
MEASURE D
COUNTY SERVICE AREA 121 -
ANIMAL CONTROL SERVICES

The County Service Area No. 121 Measure is being submitted to the voters
within the boundaries of the proposed service area pursuant to existing law, It
would not change the existing law.

If a majority of the votes cast on the measure are ‘Yes", the measure will
be approved, and the service area shall be established. The service area
would include all of the property located within the unincorporated territory of
the County of Butte; it would not include any property within the incorporated
territory of the County. Thus, no property within the cities of Biggs, Chico.
Gridley or Oroville or the Town of Paradise would be included within the
service area.

If the service area is established, it would be authorized to provide animal
control services (as specified in Board of Supervisors Resolution 89-155),
and the Board of Supervisors would be authorized to levy an annual service
charge on the real property within it to fund such services. The service charge
could not exceed S4.95 per parcel of real property in fiscal year 1990-91.

Commencing with the fiscal year 1991-92 the maximum permissible ser-
vice charge would be increased annually by a percentage equal to the annual
percentage increase in Butte County’s spending limit pursuant to Section 1 of
Article XIII.B. of the California Constitution (Gann limit); however, such
increases shall not exceed 10% annually. During the 11 years for which such
spending limit has been calculated (fiscal years 1979-80 through 1989-90),
the average annual increase was 8.80%, The average increase for the five

years ending 1989-90 was 6.38%. It is not known what the percentage
increase will be in future years.

The actual annual service charge could be less than the maximum permis-
sible charge. The actual charge could not exceed the maximum permissible
charge. The actual charge would be determined by the Board of Supervisors
and adopted after a report was filed according to law specifying the proposed
service charge for each parcel of property and a public hearing was held to
hear and consider all objections or protests. The service charges adopted
would be collected at the same time and in the same manner as county
property taxes are collected.

If a majority of the votes on measure “D" are "No", the county service
area shall not be established, and the county may not be able thereafter under
current law to provide some or all of the animal control services in question,
within the boundaries of the proposed service area, from general funds of the
county.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Ordinance or
Measure D. If you desire a copy of the ordinance or measure,
please call the elections officials office at 538-7761 and a copy
will be mailed at no cost to you.

si Neil H. McCabe
Acting County Counsel

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE D

This is an important public service proposition for unincorporated area Butte
County citizens. Budget restrictions have severely limited the ability of Butte
County to provide essential services including animal control services.

Present animal related services are limited to Health Department investigation
of animal bites and rabies related incidents and the issuance of animal related
permits and licenses. For a nominal per parcel fee, animal control services
will be restored to an acceptable level necessary to protect our citizens from
roving, marauding, and biting dogs. Restored services will reduce the trans-
mission of disease from animals to humans and between animals as well as
control animal nuisances such as noise, harassment, uncontrolled multiplica-
tion and untended dead animals. Citizens of a developed society deserve
decent animal control.

Improved services needed for general health safety and quality of our com-
munity will include:

•	Rabies prevention enhancement & expansion.

•	Stray animal pickup and sheltering.

•	Support an adoption program for unclaimed and/or unwanted animals.

•	Pickup, removal, and disposal of unowned dead animals.

•	Nuisance animal investigations & appropriate actions.

•	Spay/neuter programs encouraged and supported.

•	Support and work with community groups such as the Humane society.
PAWS, and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

All of these activities will be provided for a thrifty $4.95 per parcel per year. A
bargain for both pets and people.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE D

Budget restrictions were NOT a factor in the cancellation of Butte County
Animal Control Services in November, 1989. County government initiated a
new department, Rabies Control, spending more money providing less ser-
vice than costs of prior contractor. Doing this the county took direct control
of the animal control services, limiting them to rabies only. WHY, YOU MAY
ASK? Butte County is a state designated Rabies county. State Health and
Safety Codes and Food and Agriculture codes spell out mandated rabies
control services including a pound system and control of stray animals.
County officials are ignoring state mandates, risking our health merely to
force another tax on us. You are again being asked to tax yourself for state
mandates. Proponents admit people "deserve decent animal control" in their
argument favoring new taxes, which can and will be increased yearly forever.
Pass this measure and lose your right to vote on this issue forever.

The above mentioned services were cancelled in 1989, one year after the
cost for dog licenses was raised 4 fold. What did you get for the extra cash?
County bureacrats prefer reasoning everyone benefits, yet fail to recognize
not everyone pays. They insist on foisting more state mandated programs
down our throats and the main beneficiary will be the state

This is another unequal tax already paid once. Until property taxes, even a
"mere $5.00" are used, as intended, to benefit your property. .

JUST SAY NO TO MEASURE D

President Butte County
Taxpayers Association

JUMt 5, IWG

ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE D

Any extra tax you agree to pay in addition to property taxes you now pay
(even $5.00) only frees up that much more to be used for state social service
programs. To approve any county service area that has been funded by Butte
County until after the state of California pays for mandated programs, the cost
of which they foist off on county taxpayers, results in stealing the taxes you
already paid for animal control in order to pay for the state of California social
service programs.

To approve this new tax will only encourage the state and Butte County
government to continue as usual, DIGGING INTO YOUR POCKET as a proper-
ty owner. This service district will benefit everyone but as usual only property
owners have to pay. California and Butte County government have stolen your
animal control services away. Until property taxes are used, as intended, to
benefit your property. . . .

JUST SAY NO TO MEASURE D

s/ Nell Lind, President
Butte County Taxpayers Association

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE D

The argument against Measure D is an understandable expression of State
mandated program frustrations. -

It is inconceivable however, to believe that a vote against a small assess-,
ment ($4.95) will in any way improve the quality of life or enhance current
efforts to obtain State recognition of County problems.

A vote for Measure D will result in a dollar for dollar transfer of approved
funding to local services. County Service Area protection against stray and
vicious animals as well as the provision of other animal related services is an
affordable solution to animal control problems for caring people.

Even the opponents agree "This service district will benefit everyone.''
