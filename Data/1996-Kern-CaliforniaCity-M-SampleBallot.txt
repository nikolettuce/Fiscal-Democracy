IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
CITY OF CALIFORNIA CITY
MEASURE M

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR
CITY OF CALIFORNIA CITY
MEASUREM

If approved by a majority of the voters, Measure "M“ would authorize California
City to form an assessment district to levy, collect and expend assessments for
municipal fire suppression and panic hazard service. The assessment for each
unimproved lot or parcel would be $19.00 per year. The assessment for each
improved residential lot or parcel will be $21.09 per year. The assessment for
each improved lot or parcel used for other than residential purposes will be $22.42
per year. The assessments will be used solely to pay for the fire suppression and
panic hazard activities of the California City Fire Department.

Why, you ask?

FACTS:

Funds would be reallocated:	j

1.	To open the Swimming Pool

2.	To keep Three Police Officers

3.	To improve Park Maintenance

BENEFIT:

1. It could lower your Fire Insurance by the increased fire protection. There wou
be three firefighters per shift, one more than the current two per shift.

CALIFORNIA CITY IS OUR COMMUNITY. LET US VOTE TOGETHER T
IMPROVE OUR FIRE SERVICE, REOPEN THE SWIMMING POOL; KEE
POLICE OFFICERS AND RENEW OUR PARKS.
