Measure B

Increase in Transient Occupancy Tax
City of Palo Alto

Majority Approval Required

To provide funding that cannot be taken away by the State for general fund
infrastructure and City services such as earthquake safe fire stations; pedestrian
and bike improvements including safe routes to school, streets, sidewalks, paths,
and bridges; and maintaining parks and recreation facilities, shall the City increase
the hotel/motel tax by two percent and update language to confirm equal
treatment of traditional and online bookings?

Meaning of Voting Yes/No
A YES vote on this measure means:

A vote "For the Ordinance" will increase the hotel tax from 12% to 14% and
clarify the application to online brokers and other short-term rentals.

A NO vote on this measure means:

A vote "Against the Ordinance" will keep the hotel tax at 12%.

Impartial Analysis from City Attorney
This measure would amend Palo Alto's Transient Occupancy Tax ("TOT")
ordinance to increase the rate by two percentage points, from 12% to 14%.

The TOT, also sometimes called the "hotel tax," applies to the rent that is charged to
guests staying in hotels and other short-term rentals located in Palo Alto. Hotel tax rates
vary from city to city. In the San Francisco Bay Area, hotel tax rates generally range
from 8%to 14%. The hotel guest is responsible for paying the tax.

Currently, hotel tax revenue accounts for more than 5 percent of Palo Alto's total
general fund revenue. These revenues cannot be taken away by the state. They are used
for general local governmental purposes such as police, fire, public works, parks and
recreation, library and capital improvements.

The City estimates that the proposed 2% increase will generate additional revenues of
approximately $2,200,000 each year. The City Council has indicated an intention to use
these funds for infrastructure maintenance and improvements such as earthquake safe
fire stations, pedestrian and bike improvements, streets, sidewalks, paths, bridges, and
parks and recreation facilities.

This measure also makes minor amendments to the TOT ordinance to clarify that the
tax applies in the same manner to informal short-term room rentals and online brokers
of traditional hotel rooms. Many cities are updating their TOT ordinances to ensure that
TOT is collected on the actual rate the customer pays, rather than the "wholesale" or
other discounted rate, and to address new service delivery models. Note that these
changes do not implicitly permit hotel use that does not comply with the City's Zoning
Code.

The ordinance will become effective if a majority of those voting on the measure vote
for it.

A vote "For the Ordinance" will increase the hotel tax from 12% to 14% and clarify the
application to online brokers and other short-term rentals.

A vote "Against the Ordinance" will keep the hotel tax at 12%.

Arguments For Measure B

Vote Yes on B to ensure Palo Alto can invest in city infrastructure we need
without increasing taxes paid by local residents and businesses.

With excellent public schools, a vibrant downtown, unique neighborhoods and beautiful
natural surroundings, our community is thriving in many ways. However, local
infrastructure is aging and requires repairs and upgrades. Our oldest fire stations and
the building that houses our 9-1-1 emergency communications network do not meet
seismic safety standards. Some neighborhoods are experiencing overflow parking
impacts. City streets and sidewalks are aging and need repair or replacement as well as
safety improvements for rapidly increasing numbers of pedestrians and bicyclists of all
ages, including children walking and biking to school.

Measure B will enact a modest 2% increase in the tax paid by out of town visitors
staying in Palo Alto hotels and motels who of course rely on our roads and other
infrastructure.

Measure B will:

•	Ensure that Palo Alto's fire stations and public safety operations are seismically
safe and continue operating after a major earthquake

•	Provide safe sidewalks, paths and bridges for bikes and pedestrians, including
safe routes to school

•	Maintain city streets and roads, making dangerous intersections safer for all
users

•	Reduce neighborhood parking impacts by creating new offstreet parking options

•	Maintain city parks and recreation facilities

By law, all funds from Measure B must stay here in Palo Alto under local
control and cannot be taken away by the State.

Please join a unanimous City Council, as well as community and business leaders and
vote Yes on Measure B!

Rebuttal to Arguments For

The argument in favor of Measure B lists good things for good purposes that taxes, in
general, can provide—fire stations, bike bridges, and parks—but Measure B would in fact
collect funds for city activities in general, not for any good thing on the list. Worse, the
argument doesn't explain why it would be fair or logical to collect those funds by raising
the TOT in our city to a rate above that in neighboring communities, putting local
businesses at a serious disadvantage.

A 2% tax increase is by no means insignificant from the perspective of companies trying
to control costs. If you ran a business, and you spotted an expense going up by 2%,
you'd find a way to avoid the increase. If companies that now send people to Palo Alto
start to send them elsewhere, we will lose the TOT revenue we would have earned if
they came here, and the taxes earned on other activities associated with their visits.

Funds raised by Measure B are not and cannot be specifically earmarked by the
measure to the infrastructure projects mentioned by the proponents. The money will
simply go into the city's general fund.

Arguments Against Measure B

Raising our city's Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) to a level that puts Palo Alto at a
competitive disadvantage would be unwarranted and unfair, with unintended
consequences.

The business community believes that other, better ways can be found to fund the city's
infrastructure needs. We stand ready to work with the Council and staff to explore the
means by which those needs can be addressed. Increasing the TOT is not the answer.

Most of the burden of the added tax would fall on the employers, large and small, that
send hundreds of people on thousands of visits to this area to meet and do business. All
those employers have a keen eye for saving money, and travel expenses are often a
significant item in their budgets. If there's a higher TOT rate in Palo Alto than in
neighboring communities, there would be every reason to worry that those employers
would re-direct visitors to less expensive destinations. Palo Alto could potentially lose
some of the restaurant and retail revenue that it now receives from these visitors, and
taxes linked to that revenue, as well as money spent on lodging. Those losses could
affect city services or create the need for further taxation.

No one is arguing that hotels and hotel guests are disproportionately heavy users of city
services. Proceeds from the increase would not+ cannot+be earmarked for expenses
relating to visitors. This measure would impose an unfair burden on a single group of
Palo Alto businesses that already contribute substantially to the city's revenues.

For these reasons, the Palo Alto Chamber of Commerce and Palo Alto Downtown
Business and Professional Association are on record as opposing the TOT increase. We
ask our neighbors and fellow residents to join us in voting against it.

Rebuttal to Arguments Against

Let's get real: Measure B will add just $3 to a $150 hotel room or $4 to a $200 hotel
room. Visitors or businesses aren't going to choose less desirable locations for this
modest savings-quickly more than offset by increased travel costs.

Here's the bottom line: our aging infrastructure requires a substantial investment.
Firefighters, paramedics and our 911 system are in buildings not safe in major
earthquakes. Our streets and sidewalks must be improved for safe routes to school and
safe biking. Traffic and parking problems need solutions.

These urgent infrastructure needs were identified and prioritized by an independent
blue ribbon commission and City Council over four years. Existing city resources cover
much of the cost of these needs but leave significant gaps. After extensive community

input, the hotel/motel tax was identified as the best choice to fund the balance while
minimizing costs to local taxpayers.

Raising property or sales taxes would increase costs for businesses, homeowners and
renters. A modest increase in the hotel/motel tax is a fair solution passed along to out-
of-town visitors who use our roads, public safety services and attractive community
amenities.

Every penny from measure B stays in Palo Alto and can't be taken away by the state.

Forward thinking Palo Altans made smart investments to make Palo Alto what it is
today. We owe it to future generations to make a modest investment so Palo Alto
continues to thrive.

Please join us-vote yes on B.

2.33.020	Tax imposed.

For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to and shall pay a

extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city or to a rental agent pursuant
to section 2.33.140. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the
time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax
shall be made with each installment. Any unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient's
ceasing occupancy in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the
operator of the hotel, the supervisor of revenue collections may require that such tax
shall be paid directly to the supervisor of revenue collections.

(Ord. 4983 § 1, 2007: Ord. 3704 § 1 (part), 1986: Ord. 3425 § 1,1983: Ord. 2928 § 1,

California or provides written evidence of such official business on a form approved in
advance by the supervisor of revenue collections. Copies of the documentation for each
exemption claimed must be submitted to the supervisor of revenue collections with
each return made pursuant to Section 2.33.060.

No exemption shall be granted under this section except upon a claim therefor made at
the time rent is collected and under penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by the
supervisor of revenue collections. Additionally, a copy of such warrant or check and a

copy of such claim form shall be submitted with each return made pursuant to Section
2.33.060.

2.33.040	Operator's duties.

Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this ordinance to the same extent and at
the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The amount of tax shall be
separately stated from the amount of the rent charged, and each transient shall receive
a receipt for payment from the operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state
in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be
assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if
added, any part will be refunded except in the manner hereinafter provided. (Ord. 3704
§ 1 (part), 1986: Ord. 2567 § 1 (part), 1970)

issued by the building official pursuant to Title 16 and apply for registration of said
hotel with the supervisor of revenue collections who will issue a "Transient Occupancy
Registration Certificate" to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises
by such registrant or any operator previously registered. The application shall require
such information as the supervisor of revenue collections deems necessary or
convenient to the collection of the tax imposed by this chapter. The supervisor of
revenue collections may require updating of application information from time to time
as he or she deems necessary or advisable. Registration under this section shall lapse
with the certificate of occupancy upon which it was issued. Said certificate shall, among
other things, state the following:

(1)	The name of the operator;

(2)	The address of the hotel;

(3)	The date upon which the certificate was issued;

(4)	"This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the person named
on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of Chapter 2.33 of the Palo Alto
Municipal Code 'Transient Occupancy Tax' by registering with the supervisor of revenue
collections for the purpose of collecting from transients the Transient Occupancy Tax
and remitting said tax to the supervisor of revenue collections. This certificate does not
authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful
business in an unlawful manner, or to operate a hotel without strictly complying with
all local applicable laws, including but not limited to those requiring a permit from any
board, commission, department or office of this city. This certificate does not constitute
a permit and is not transferable to a different operator."

Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the close of the
previous calendar month, or at the close of any shorter reporting period which may be
established by the supervisor of revenue collections, make a return to the supervisor of
revenue collections on forms provided by him or her of the total rents charged to
transients and the total rents paid bv transientsreceived and the amount of tax collected
for transient occupancies. If no tax was due or collected during the previous reporting
period, the operator shall file a return so stating under penalty of perjury. At the time
the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the supervisor
of revenue collections. The supervisor of revenue collections may establish shorter
reporting periods for any certificate holder if he or she deems it necessary in order to
ensure collection of the tax, and he or she may require further information in the return.
Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason.
All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the
account of the city until payment thereof is made to the supervisor of revenue
collections.

(Ord. 3704 § 1 (part), 1986: Ord. 2567 § 1 (part), 1970)

2.33.070	Penalties.

(a)	Original Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this
chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty of ten percent of the amount of the
tax which penalty amount shall be added to the amount of the tax, for purposes of
calculating additional penalties.

(b)	Continued Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent remittance
on or before a period of thirty days following the date on which the remittance first
became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency penalty of ten percent of the amount
of the tax including the ten percent penalty first imposed.

(c)	Fraud or Misrepresentation. If the director of finance, in his or her judgment,
determines that the nonpayment of any remittance due under this chapter is due to
intentional conduct, misrepresentation or fraud, a penalty of twenty-five percent of the
amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties stated in
subsections (a) and (b) of this section.

(d)	Additional Penalty. In addition to the penalties imposed under subsections (a) and

(b)	of this section, any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall
pay a penalty of one percent per month or fraction thereof, whichever is less, on the
amount of the tax from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until
paid.

(e)	Penalties Merged with Tax. Every penalty imposed and such additional penalties as
accrue under the provisions of this section shall become a part of the tax herein
required to be paid.

(Ord. 3704 § 1 (part), 1986: Ord. 2567 § 1 (part), 1970)

2.33.080	Failure to collect and report tax; determination of tax by supervisor of
revenue collections.

If any operator fails or refuses to collect said tax and to make, within the time provided
in this chapter, any report and remittance of said tax or any portion thereof required by
this chapter, the supervisor of revenue collections shall proceed in such manner as he or
she may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base his or her estimate
of the tax due. As soon as the supervisor of revenue collections shall procure such facts
and information as he or she is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any
tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to
collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he or she shall proceed to
determine and assess against such operator the tax and penalties provided by this
chapter. In case such determination is made, the supervisor of revenue and collections
shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by sending it personally or by depositing it
in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his
or her last known place of address.

Such operator may within fourteen days after serving or mailing of such notice make
application in writing to the supervisor of revenue collections for a hearing on the
amount assessed. If application by an operator is not made within the time prescribed,
the tax and penalties, if any, determined by the supervisor of revenue collections to be
due shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such
application is made, the supervisor of revenue collections shall give not less than ten
days' written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at a
time and place fixed in said notice why said amount specified therein should not be
fixed for such tax and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer
evidence why such specified tax and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing,
the supervisor of revenue collections shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and
shall thereafter give written notice to the person operator in the manner prescribed
herein of such determination and the amount of such tax and penalties. The amount
determined to be due shall be payable after twenty days of the serving or mailing of
such determination unless an appeal is taken as provided in Section 2.33.090.

2.33.090	Appeal.

Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the supervisor of revenue and collections
with respect to the amount of such tax and penalties, if any, may appeal to the director
of finance or his or her designee by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk within
twenty days of the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The director of
finance or the designee shall fix a time and place for hearing of such appeal, and give
notice in writing to such operator at his or her last known place of address. The findings
of the director of finance or the designee shall be final and conclusive and shall be
served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of
hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the
service of notice.

It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment to the city of
any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve all records as may be necessary to
determine the amount of such tax as he or she may have been liable for the collection of
and payment to the city. Said records shall be kept or made available at one location
within the limits of the city for a period of three years. The supervisor of revenue
collections and/or city auditor or their designee shall have the right at any and all
reasonable times, to examine and audit said records for the purpose of determining the
accuracy thereof.

(Ord. 3704 § 1 (part], 1986: Ord. 2567 § 1 (part], 1970]

2.33.110	Refunds.

(a]	Claim Required. Prior to seeking judicial relief with respect to a dispute regarding
the amount of any tax, penalty, or interest collected or received by the city under this
chapter, an aggrieved taxpayer, fee payer, operator, transient or any other person must
comply with the provisions of section 2.28.230 of this code.

(b]	Operators. An operator may claim as an overpayment any tax previously paid which
was calculated on the basis of taxable consideration written off by the operator as a bad
debt in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and claimed as a
deduction on a federal income tax return in accordance with provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code, and regulations issued pursuant thereto. The bad debt claim may be
taken as an adjustment to future taxes due the city after the operator's procedure and
forms for adjustment of bad debt have been reviewed and approved by the supervisor
of revenue collections.

(c]	Transients. A transient may only request a refund of taxes under this chapter when
the transient, having paid the tax to the operator, establishes that the transient has been
unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax.

operator which has not been paid to the city shall be deemed a debt owed by the
operator to the city. Any person owing money to the city under the provisions of this
chapter shall be liable to an action brought in the name of the city for the recovery of
such amount.

(Ord. 3704 § 1 (part], 1986: Ord. 2567 § 1 (part), 1970)

2.33.130	Violations; misdemeanor.

Any operator or other person who violates any of the provisions of this chapter or who
fails or refuses to register as required herein, or to furnish any returns or other data
required by the supervisor of revenue collections, or who renders a false or fraudulent
return or claim, is guilty of a misdemeanor, and is punishable as provided in this code.

fa)	Any transient who pays rent to a rental agent instead of to an operator shall, at the
time the rent is paid, pay the tax to the rental agent in the manner required by section

2.33.020.	If for anv reason the tax is not paid to the rental agent, it shall be paid to the

collect, remit or report any tax, the supervisor may take any action against the rental
agent that he or she may take against an operator under sections 2.33.070 and 2.33.080
of this chapter subject to the requirements of those sections. If the supervisor assesses
unremitted taxes and penalties against the rental agent, the rental agent shall be subject
to the provisions of sections 2.33080. 2.33.090. 2.33.110. and 2.33.120 of this chapter as

that any amendment to Chapter 2.33 that increases the amount or rate of tax due from
any Person beyond the amounts and rates authorized by this Ordinance may not take
effect unless approved by a vote of the people.

SECTION 4. Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion
of this Ordinance is for any reason held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of
competent jurisdiction, the remaining portions of this Ordinance shall nonetheless

remain in full force and effect. The people hereby declare that they would have adopted
each section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this Ordinance,
irrespective of the fact that any one or more sections, subsections, sentences, clauses,
phrases, or portions of this Ordinance be declared invalid or unenforceable.

SECTION 5. Effective Date. This ordinance shall be effective only if approved by a
majority of the voters and shall go into effect immediately after the vote is declared by
the City Council and the duty of service providers to collect the tax shall commence as
provided in California Public Utilities Code Section 799.

SECTION 6. Execution. The Mayor is hereby authorized to attest to the adoption of this
Ordinance by the voters of the City by signing where indicated below.

City Attorney's Impartial Analysis of Measure B

This measure would amend Palo Alto's Transient Occupancy Tax ("TOT") ordinance to
increase the rate by two percentage points, from 12% to 14%.

The TOT, also sometimes called the "hotel tax," applies to the rent that is charged to
guests staying in hotels and other short-term rentals located in Palo Alto. Hotel tax rates vary
from city to city. In the San Francisco Bay Area, hotel tax rates generally range from 8% to 14%.
The hotel guest is responsible for paying the tax.

Currently, hotel tax revenue accounts for more than 5 percent of Palo Alto's total
general fund revenue. These revenues cannot be taken away by the state. They are used for
general local governmental purposes such as police, fire, public works, parks and recreation,
library and capital improvements.

The City estimates that the proposed 2% increase will generate additional revenues of
approximately $2,200,000 each year. The City Council has indicated an intention to use these
funds for infrastructure maintenance and improvements such as earthquake safe fire stations,
pedestrian and bike improvements, streets, sidewalks, paths, bridges, and parks and recreation
facilities.

This measure also makes minor amendments to the TOT ordinance to clarify that the tax
applies in the same manner to informal short-term room rentals and online brokers of
traditional hotel rooms. Many cities are updating their TOT ordinances to ensure that TOT is
collected on the actual rate the customer pays, rather than the "wholesale" or other discounted
rate, and to address new service delivery models. Note that these changes do not implicitly
permit hotel use that does not comply with the City's Zoning Code.

The ordinance will become effective if a majority of those voting on the measure vote

for it.

A vote "For the Ordinance" will increase the hotel tax from 12% to 14% and clarify the
application to online brokers and other short-term rentals.

A vote "Against the Ordinance" will keep the hotel tax at 12%.

City of Palo Alto
Argument in Favor of 2014 Measure B

Vote Yes on B to ensure Palo Alto can invest in city infrastructure we need without
increasing taxes paid by local residents and businesses.

With excellent public schools, a vibrant downtown, unique neighborhoods and beautiful
natural surroundings, our community is thriving in many ways. However, local
infrastructure is aging and requires repairs and upgrades. Our oldest fire stations and the
building that houses our 9-1-1 emergency communications network do not meet seismic
safety standards. Some neighborhoods are experiencing overflow parking impacts. City
streets and sidewalks are aging and need repair or replacement as well as safety
improvements for rapidly increasing numbers of pedestrians and bicyclists of all ages,
including children walking and biking to school.

Measure B will enact a modest 2% increase in the tax paid by out of town visitors
staying in Palo Alto hotels and motels who of course rely on our roads and other
infrastructure.

Measure B will:

•	Ensure that Palo Alto’s fire stations and public safety operations are seismically safe
and continue operating after a major earthquake

•	Provide safe sidewalks, paths and bridges for bikes and pedestrians, including safe
routes to school

•	Maintain city streets and roads, making dangerous intersections safer for all users

•	Reduce neighborhood parking impacts by creating new off-street parking options

•	Maintain city parks and recreation facilities

By law, all funds from Measure B must stay here in Palo Alto under local control and cannot
be taken away by the State.

Please join a unanimous City Council, as well as community and business leaders and
vote Yes on Measure B!

Rebuttal to Argument in Favor of Measure B

GITY etERK’S
if J

The argument in favor of Measure B lists good things for good purposes that taxes,
in general, can provide - fire stations, bike bridges, and parks - but Measure B
would in fact collect funds for city activities in general, not for any good thing on
the list. Worse, the argument doesn’t explain why it would be fair or logical to
collect those funds by raising the TOT in our city to a rate above that in
neighboring communities, putting local businesses at a serious disadvantage.

A 2% tax increase is by no means insignificant from the perspective of companies
trying to control costs. If you ran a business, and you spotted an expense going up
by 2%, you’d find a way to avoid the increase. If companies that now send people
to Palo Alto start to send them elsewhere, we will lose the TOT revenue we would
have earned if they came here, and the taxes earned on other activities associated
with their visits.

Funds raised by Measure B are not and cannot be specifically earmarked by the
measure to the infrastructure projects mentioned by the proponents. The money
will simply go into the city’s general fund.

Please join us in voting “No.”

Argument against Measure B

:ny of palo auo.ga

CITY CLERK'S OPPf0T

I *» AUG 12 PH M28

Raising our city’s Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) to a level that puts Palo Alto at a competitive
disadvantage would be unwarranted and unfair, with unintended consequences.

The business community believes that other, better ways can be found to fund the city’s
infrastructure needs. We stand ready to work with the Council and staff to explore the means by
which those needs can be addressed. Increasing the TOT is not the answer.

Most of the burden of the added tax would fall on the employers, large and small, that send
hundreds of people on thousands of visits to this area to meet and do business. All those employers
have a keen eye for saving money, and travel expenses are often a significant item in their budgets.

If there’s a higher TOT rate in Palo Alto than in neighboring communities, there would be every
reason to worry that those employers would re-direct visitors to less expensive destinations. Palo
Alto could potentially lose some of the restaurant and retail revenue that it now receives from these
visitors, and taxes linked to that revenue, as well as money spent on lodging. Those losses could
affect city services or create the need for further taxation.

No one is arguing that hotels and hotel guests are disproportionately heavy users of city services.
Proceeds from the increase would not - cannot - be earmarked for expenses relating to visitors.

This measure would impose an unfair burden on a single group of Palo Alto businesses that already
contribute substantially to the city’s revenues.

For these reasons, the Palo Alto Chamber of Commerce and Palo Alto Downtown Business and
Professional Association are on record as opposing the TOT increase. We ask our neighbors and
fellow residents to join us in voting against it.

ARGUMENT! AGAINST
MEASURE

Rebuttal Argument for Measure B

Let's get real: Measure B will add just $3 to a $150 hotel room or $4 to a $200
hotel room. Visitors or businesses aren’t going to choose less desirable locations
for this modest savings - quickly more than offset by increased travel costs..

Here's the bottom line: our aging infrastructure requires a substantial investment.
Firefighters, paramedics and our 911 system are in buildings not safe in major
earthquakes. Our streets and sidewalks must be improved for safe routes to
school and safe biking. Traffic and parking problems need solutions.

These urgent infrastructure needs were identified and prioritized by an
independent blue ribbon commission and City Council over four years. Existing
city resources cover much of the cost of these needs but leave significant gaps.
After extensive community input, the hotel/motel tax was identified as the best
choice to fund the balance while minimizing costs to local taxpayers.

Raising property or sales taxes would increase costs for businesses,
homeowners and renters. A modest increase in the hotel/motel tax is a fair
solution passed along to out- of -town visitors who use our roads, public safety
services and attractive community amenities.

Every penny from measure B stays in Palo Alto and can't be taken away by the
state.

Forward thinking Palo Allans made smart investments to make Palo Alto what it
is today. We owe it to future generations to make a modest investment so Palo
Alto continues to thrive.

Please join us - vote yes on B.
