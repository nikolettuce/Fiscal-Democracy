FULL TEXT OF MEASURE B
COUNTY OF DEL NORTE
AN ORDINANCE INCREASING THE TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY
TAX RATE FROM EIGHT PERCENT (8%)

TO TEN PERCENT (10%).

Section One. Section 3.08.030, of Chapter 3.08 of the Del
Norte County Ordinance Code, “Rate - Payment,” is hereby amended
by changing, in the first sentence of that section, the County’s
transient occupancy tax rate from eight percent (8%) to ten percent
(10%). The amended first sentence of Section 3.08.030 shall read
in its entirety as follows, with the remainder of that section to remain
unchanged by this ordinance:

3.08.030 Rate - Payment.

For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is
subject to and shall pay a tax of ten percent of the rent charged by
the operator.

Section Two. This ordinance increases an existing transient
occupancy tax. Funds derived from this increase of the existing tax
shall be deposited into the county general fund and may be used
for general government purposes.

Section Three. This ordinance shall take effect only upon its
approval by a majority of the votes cast for or against its passage
at the next general election of the voters of Del Norte County. The
effective date of the tax approved herein shall be the thirty-first
calendar day after certification of its passage by the Board of
Supervisors.

Section Four. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause or
phrase of this ordinance is for any reason held to be invalid or
unenforceable, such decision shall not affect the validity of the
remaining portions of this ordinance. The Board of Supervisors
hereby declares that it would have passed this ordinance and each
section, subsection, clause or phrase thereof, irrespective of the fact
that any one or more sections, subsections, clauses or phrases be
declared invalid or unenforceable.

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL
MEASURE B

The Del Norte County transient occupancy tax (TOT) is currently
8% of the rental charge on lodging in “hotels,” as defined in the
county ordinance. Measure B would increase that rate to 10% of
the rental charge. This increase would apply to the unincorporated
area of the County.

The Del Norte County Board of Supervisors has adopted
ordinance number 2006-12, which increases the TOT rate from 8%
to 10%. However, the ordinance also provides that it does not go
into effect unless it is approved by a majority of the voters.

A YES vote on Measure B would approve the amendment to
increase the County TOT rate from 8% to 10%.

A NO vote continues the County TOT rate at 8%.

Any new revenues from the increase from 8% to 10% are not
earmarked. They can be budgeted for any lawful county purpose
by the Board of Supervisors.

si Robert N. Black
Del Norte County Counsel

FISCAL IMPACT STATEMENT FOR MEASURE B

The transient occupancy tax is a tax imposed by the County of
Del Norte on persons renting rooms and other accommodations at
motels, hotels and similar lodging in the unincorporated areas of
Del Norte County.

The current transient occupancy rate is 8%. Approval of this
ballot measure will increase the rate to 10%. This increase will
generate approximately an additional $62,500.

Transient occupancy tax revenue is considered general purpose
revenue and can be used to support such activities as Sheriff, District
Attorney, Health, Mental Health, Social Services, Recreation and
Parks and tourism promotional agencies. There is no fiscal impact
on County residents unless they stay at a motel or hotel in the
unincorporated area of the County.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE B

Vote YES on Measure B.

Measure B is Realistic.

Tourism helps support our economy. The Board of Supervisors
recently committed $62,000 per year to promote tourism in Del Norte

county.

But the influx of tourists has its costs. Local property tax payers
support many services that benefit the welcome travelers through
our community. The dollars must come from someone.

Measure B recognizes that tourists should be paying for some
of the services that protect them and enhance their experience here.

Measure B is Common Sense.

Throughout California, most local governments receive a 10%
transient occupancy tax. Locally, Crescent City and Humboldt County
are already at a 10% TOT. Many of the cities in Humboldt County
already charge 10%.

Travelers already expect to pay local taxes. It makes sense for
Del Norte County to have its tax rate in line with communities
throughout the state.

Measure B is Balanced.	
Vote YES on Measure B.
