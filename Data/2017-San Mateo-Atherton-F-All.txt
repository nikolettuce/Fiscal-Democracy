IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE _

AUTHORIZING RENEWAL OF THE ATHERTON PARCEL TAX
FOR AN ADDITIONAL THREE YEARS AND ALLOWING EXPENDITURE OF FUNDS

DERIVED FROM ANY TAX IMPOSED

The California Constitution and state law authorize the voters of a town, by a two-thirds majority,
to approve a parcel tax for specified purposes. Since 1980, Atherton voters have approved such a parcel
tax 8 times, the last in 2013 for a four year period.

This measure would extend the parcel tax for three years at the current rates for the following
purposes: (1) police emergency response services and neighborhood patrols; (2) street repair and
maintenance; and (3) drainage facility repair and maintenance. These funds cannot be used for other
governmental services which will be paid from other revenue sources, mainly regular property taxes.

Each year the City Council must adopt an annual budget and decide how much, if any, of this tax
should be imposed and collected. It must hold a public hearing to establish the need for the proposed tax.
The tax may not exceed the amount the City Council determines to be necessary to provide adequate
levels of the municipal services and capital improvements outlined above after deducting the projected
revenue to be gathered from other sources. That does not mean there are no other revenue sources that
will also be used to fund police and other services. It means that in any given year there is always strong
competition for all of the available funds to pay for municipal services that are important to many
residents, and that these Parcel Tax revenues will only be used for purposes set forth above.

There is a maximum amount each parcel can be assessed each year as set forth in Section 5 of the
Ordinance which is included in the ballot materials. The tax imposed in any year will be collected by the
County Tax Collector as part of the annual property tax bill or by the Town itself. Any funds collected
shall be placed in a special fund for the stated purposes. Use for any other purpose would be illegal. Any
tax levied will be a lien on individual parcels like other property taxes.

The measure also authorizes the raising of the Town’s appropriations limit as permitted by Cal.
Const, art XIIIB, the so-called Gann limit, during the time in which this parcel tax is collected so the tax
funds may be spent once collected.

If approved, authority to levy this tax will commence for fiscal year 2018-2019 and will expire
after fiscal tax year 2020-2021.

A "yes" vote is a vote to extend the Town's special parcel tax at its current levels as approved by
the City Council each year.

A "no" vote is a vote to end the levy of a special parcel tax for the Town after the 2017-2018

year.

such services will exceed the amount of funds generated through other revenue and income,

and/or if capital improvements are required, the cost of which exceeds the amount of funds

The Special Parcel Tax is an important component of the Town’s financial health - is not a \ 3
new tax. It renews an existing parcel tax supported by residents for almost 40 years. Most 3 3
parcels, 1/2 to 2 acres, are assessed a maximum of $750 annually. Total revenue from all parcels
is $1.86M, representing 13% of Town’s total annual revenue. 100% of the Parcel Tax goes to the 1^7^-
Town, unlike your basic property tax where only about 9% goes to the Town. ^

Use of the Parcel Tax is restricted to: ^°\



•	police/emergency services and critical 9-1-1 capabilities

•	front-line law enforcement and school resource officer v03

The Special Parcel Tax is obsolete. Why?

“1

In order to answer this question one must look at its history. When introduced in 1978 the cost 2.5
of real property in Atherton, and consequently the total real property taxes collected, was	3

relatively low. One could still find homes for $500,000.	Ljo

Atherton real estate taxes were insufficient to fund capital improvements and maintain critical (& j
operations. Houses were selling for 10% or less of today’s prices.	-

The parcel tax was bom.	“3

For years the parcel tax has been used 100% for capital improvements and recently a small part
funds public safety.	^	-J

But times have changed. Try to find a $3M lot in Atherton, let alone a home, and that lot might \ 11
soon have a $20M home built on it. Property values have skyrocketed and the actual increased 1 ^
real property taxes collected have far exceeded the sums attributable to parcel taxes collected in \ ^ X
those same years. Thus, the historical reason for assessing a parcel tax no longer exists.	\<j> 3

The town has promised in the past not to collect parcel taxes unless needed. With this soaring	\ £ 0

income stream the town should no longer continue to assess a parcel tax. Like the rest of us, it	\*\°i

should live within its means.	-2/0 L{

This past election we were informed that there would be no new taxes and the town had enough *2. 2- 2_
money to meet all obligations. The town underscored this by stating it has an “existing	~7

unallocated surplus of $4.423M” in the capital improvement account. Clearly, if there is already 2/3 )
so much “SURPLUS” in the capital improvement fund, we do not need another NEW parcel tax.

As taxpayers we can agree that we already pay too much in taxes. We can agree that enough is ^ ^ ^
enough. Let's agree finally to end the parcel tax.	5

The facts: 2-

« The income from property taxes received by the town has so 13
increased in the past few years that it will exceed income from the NEW Z
parcel tax.

© Without this parcel tax the town has more income than ever before. ^ |
Police services account for 55.2% of the budget, which costs increased S'2_
by $1,183,540 (19.6%) since 2015-16. Parcel taxes primarily fund only
ONE local school resource officer, O'T-

® According to the town’s 2016-17 budget, and by law, the parcel tax 3<a
constitutes 2.5% (NOT 13%) of the general fund, s- T-

® The town HAS $4.4M in its capital improvement fund that it can ^ ^
spend on capital projects like roads, drainage and safe bike and 11 o
pedestrian routes. It has indicated it will instead spend it on a building ^ ^3
because it is “SURPLUS’pfEXTRA”. \ zg

o A common refrain in town government has been “we have the
money”. If there is no limit to how much can be spent, it will all be
spent. This reaction is one reason the council has never adjusted the I Ol-
parcel tax below the maximum amount despite its pledge to do so if the IS I
money was not needed. I

Rebuttal to Argument Against Measure__

The renewal of the Atherton Parcel Tax is more important now I1
than ever. It is 13% of the Town's annual revenue. 100% goes to
the Town for police services, road repairs and drainage projects. 5 m
These funds cannot be used for general purposes, the civic
center or park expenses. H S'"

This is not a new tax, merely av three-year continuation of an -b [
existing tax that has not increased in 22 years,

The argument against doesn't have the facts right:

• They claim that Atherton doesn't need the Parcel Tax % T~
because we have current surpluses. We have a current
surplus because of conservative fiscal planning and \0^
financial management. These surplus funds are scheduled \ V o
to be used over the next three years primarily on drainage \ z \
projects and to build a voter-approved civic center. ISO

• The argument against also says that the parcel tax has
been used 100% for capital improvements. This isn't true, t
Historically, it has supported both police and road repairs.

Your YES vote confirms that you see the value in maintaining
our infrastructure and high-quality police services. This
maintains our standard of living, and preserves and enhances
our property values. \<gc\

Since 1978, residents have strongly supported the Parcel Tax by
as much as 80%.

This Parcel Tax proposal is for three years, rather than four, 2
because in three years we will know the status of the civic center ^ ^ ^
project. Given our recent surpluses, the council believes that we 9^^
should reconsider the parcel tax in 2020.

PLEASE VOTE YES!
