MEASURE B2012
Santa Barbara Unified School District
IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL

The California Constitution, Article XIIIA, section 4 and the California
Government Code (Section 50075 at seq.) authorize a school district,
upon approval by a two-thirds vote (2/3) of the voters within the district,
to impose a special tax on real property parcels within the district.

This measure, if approved by two-thirds (2/3) of the voters within the
boundaries of the former Santa Barbara Elementary School District (the
‘'District"), will authorize the District to levy a parcel tax of $40 per year
against each parcel of land that lies wholly or partially within the
boundaries of the former Santa Barbara Elementary School District that
has been assigned an assessor's parcel number. (The full text of the
measure is printed in the ballot pamphlet).

The parcel tax is to be levied for four (4) fiscal years, without increase,
beginning in the fiscal year starting July 1, 2013, The parcel tax would
be in addition to the parcel tax proposed by the District in Measure
A2012 if Measure A2012 is also approved by the voters. The parcel tax
shall be collected in the same manner and will be subject to the same
interest and penalties as general property taxes and the proceeds will
be deposited into a separate restricted account and shall be used only
for the fallowing specific elementary level educational purposes:

•	Maintain math, science and technology education;

•	Maintain classroom music;

•	Help maintain class sizes;

•	Attracting and retaining quality teachers with no funding of
administrator salaries

•	Providing a citizens oversight committee

•	Providing independent financial	audits

An annual written report will be made to the District’s Board of
Education (the "Board") showing (1) the amount of funds collected and
expended from tax proceeds, (2) the status of any projects or programs
funded by the parcel tax listed above, and (3) an annual independent
financial audit. Tax proceeds shall not be spent on administrative
salaries.

The oversight committee shall advise the Board on expenditures funded
by the measure to ensure funds are only spent by the District for the
purposes stated in the measure. Elementary charter schools authorized
by the District shall share in the tax funding, proportional to the
enrollment of students from the District and will report annually to the
Board and community on how tax funds have been spent.

Any owner that is 65 years of age or older of a parcel used solely for
owner-occupied single-family residential purposes may receive an
exemption from the parcel tax by annually submitting an application by
June 15 of each year to the Board in accordance with the Board’s
adopted rules and regulations,

A YES vote means the measure and parcel tax are APPROVED.

A NO vote means the measure and parcel tax are NOT APPROVED.

MEASURE B2012
Santa Barbara Elementary School District
ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE

In 2008 our community overwhelmingly approved secure, dedicated,
local funding far our elementary school children and classrooms. After
four years of providing successful programs that have improved student
achievement and provided local elementary schools with educational
enhancements, this funding is set to expire.

With Measure B2012 we now have the opportunity to extend this critical
funding for another four years.

As community members, parents, teachers, and business people, we
strongly support continuing this local funding that:

•	cannot be taken by the state;

•	requires ALL funds be used locally in the Santa Barbara
Unified School District;

•	cannot be spent on administrator salaries and benefits;

•	requires mandatory independent citizen oversight.

By voting Yes for Measure B2012 our children will continue to benefit
from:

•	Essential math and science programs

•	Music education for all elementary students

•	Maintenance of class sizes that foster academic success

•	Updated computer and educational technologies

•	Attracting and retaining quality teachers

Nothing is more important to the future of our community than
supporting the education of our children. The students of today will be
the workforce, homebuyers, business owners, and taxpayers of
tomorrow.

High quality public schools enhance property values and benefit our
local economy. The educational programs provided by Measure B2012
also engage our children and provide them with educational activities
that have benefits well beyond the classroom.

Communities that provide the types of enriched educational programs
as those funded by Measure B2012 have higher student achievement,
lower dropout rates, less juvenile crime, and an increased number of
students who become productive members of the community.

By supporting Measure B2012 we are creating local funding that can be
directed to programs most needed by our elementary schools and
prep^	in	school arid in life.

Please join us and vote Yes on Measure B2012,

The undersigned authors of the argument in favor of Measure B2012 at
the General Election for the Santa Barbara Unified School District to be
held on November 6, 2012 hereby state that this argument is true and
correct to the best of their knowledge and belief.
