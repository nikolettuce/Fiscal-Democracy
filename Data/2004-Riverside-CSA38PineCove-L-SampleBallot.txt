IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEmSURE “L”

CSA 38 (PINE COVE) SPECIAL ELECTION

FIRE PROTECTION & AMBULANCE SERVICE SPECIAL TAX

In 1976 the Board of Supervisors established County Service Area
No. 38 (CSA 38) to provide extended fire protection services in the Pine
Cove area. In 1997 ambulance service was added to CSA 38.

Historically an annual charge from each parcel in CSA 38 and a portion of
the countywide ad valorem property tax provided funding to pay for CSA
38 extended services.

In 1996 under Proposition 218, County Service Areas had to obtain voter
approval for existing assessments, but CSA 38 did not participate in the
countywide election. Consequently, no assessments have been
collected since 1996,

CSA 38 has been providing its extended services by using the existing
fund reserve balance and ongoing accumulation of ad valorem appor-
tionments.

A yes vote will result in a $50.00 per parcel per year special tax to pay for
equipment and supplies for the Pine Cove Volunteer Firefighting
Company and to maintain enhanced ambulance service. The special tax
may be increased by approximately 2% each year.

A no vote will result in no special tax to pay for firefighting equipment or to
maintain the current ambulance service.

ARGUMEN. fN FAVOR OF MEASURE “L”

Established in 1976, County Service Area 38 (CSA 38) contin-
ues to serve the community of Pine Cove by providing enhanced
fire protection and ambulance service.

CSA 38 provides fire protection training and equipment for the
Pine Cove Volunteer Fire Company. Enhanced ambulance service
(EAS) is currently provided through a contract with the nearby
idyllwild Fire Protection District (IFPD). By paying for enhanced
level of service, the residents of CSA 38 (Pine Cove) have the
benefit of a much better response time than if services were
provided by American Medical Response (AMR) whose ambulance
would be dispatched from the Banning or Hemet area.

Living in such a rural mountain community as Pine Cove,
immediate medical attention is imperative. The "Golden Hour" for
emergency trauma intervention is a widely accepted standard in
emergency medicine. For every minute a patient is in full
cardio-respiratory arrest the chances of recovery reduces by 10%.
Time is critical. Rapid response time may be the single most identi-
fiable quality of an EMS system. HOW MUCH IS YOUR LltE OR A
LOVED ONES LIFE WORTH?

We urge you to vote "YES" for this special tax and to encourage
your fellow community members to join you. This annual assess-
ment goes directly toward the purchase of fire equipment and train-
ing for our volunteers and enhanced ambulance protection.
