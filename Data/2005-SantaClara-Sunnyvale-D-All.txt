Impartial Analysis from County Counsel
California law permits a city to increase a general tax within its jurisdiction if the tax increase is approved by a simple majority of the voters voting in an election.
The business license tax applies to a business operating in the City of Sunnyvale. The City of Sunnyvale's current business license tax for a business in the City of Sunnyvale is $10 for every 5 employees or rental units and is capped at $300. The current tax was established in 1968 and has not been increased since that date. The City of Sunnyvale proposes to increase its existing business license tax from $10 for every 5 employees or rental units to $30 for 1, $50 for 2-5, and $50 for each additional group of up to 5 employees or rental units, whichever is greater. The maximum business license tax will be capped at $4,250 for rental units and $9,500 for employees with the tax phased in over a two year period and the cap phased in over a three year period.
The 2007 tax is $20 for the first employee, $30 for 2 to 5 employees or rental units, and an additional $25 for each additional group of up to 5 employees or rental units. The 2007 cap is $4,700 for employees and $2,500 for rental units. The 2008 tax is $30 for the first employee, $50 for 2-5 employees or rental units, and $50 for each additional group of up to 5 employees or rental units. The 2008 cap is $7,000 for employees and $3,500 for rental units. The 2009 tax is the same as 2008, with the cap raised to $9,500 for employees and $4,250 for rental units. After 2009 for the tax and 2010 for the cap, these will be adjusted annually based on the consumer price index increase for the period 2 years prior to the tax year.
The proceeds of the business license tax , as a general tax, will be deposited in the city's general fund and used for general governmental purposes, including police and fire protection services, library, and parks services.
A "yes" vote is a vote to increase the City of Sunnyvale business license tax to $30 for 1, $50 for 2-5, and $50 for each additional group of up to 5 employees or rental units, with the maximum business license tax capped at $4,250 for rental units and $9,500 for employees and with the tax increase phased in over a two year period and cap increase phased in over a three year period.
A "no" vote is a vote not to increase the business license tax from its current rate of $10 for every 5 employees or rental units.

Argument For Measure D
Sunnyvale is facing hard budgetary times, and the City Council has responded with targeted service reductions. Two years ago the city faced a $15 million annual structural deficit. Today that deficit has been reduced to about $1.75 million. Cutting that much has caused hardship for many residents and businesses as services they've relied on disappear. The economy is starting to look up, but even with an upturn the City will have to cut more.
Measure D proposes to help balance the budget through an increase in the cost of a Sunnyvale Business License. When enacted, it will add about $1 per month to the salary cost of a business's employees, and about $1 per month to the rent for an apartment. It may seem like a small amount of money, but it will go a long way to help the City do its job.
The last time the cost of a Business License in Sunnyvale was changed was 30 years ago. The largest employer in Sunnyvale currently pays about $300 per year to do business here. In San Jose they would have to pay more than $24,000.
The Sunnyvale Chamber of Commerce and most business contacted by the City have recognized that this situation should change, and they have endorsed this measure. When it passes it will help, but it will not solve the problem. The City Council will have to make more cuts even if the Business License cost is increased.
We ask you to give a vote of confidence in Sunnyvale and its government. Vote YES on Measure D, and help us do what must be done to keep Sunnyvale the clean, healthy and prosperous community that it is.
