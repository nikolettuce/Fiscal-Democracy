Shall the City of Weed adopt an Ordinance amending 3.24.040 of the Municipal
Code to increase the rate of the City's Sales and Use Tax by 0.25% to fund the
operation, maintenance, and improvement of a public library operated within the

Impartial analysis

The following impartial analysis was prepared for Measure J;!1!

Since 1968, the City of Weed has imposed a 1% sales and use tax. In addition, the
State of California currently charges 6.5%, for a total of 7.5%, including a 1/4 of
1% temporary increase as a result of Proposition 30, which increase will expire at
the end of 2016. Measure J would increase the City’s tax by 1/4 of 1%, resulting in
a 25-Cent increase of the sales tax on a $100 purchase. The additional revenues
would be used by the city for general purposes, including the city library, senior
programs and services, police and fire protection, and street maintenance.!3!
