Teacher Retention/Education Programs Parcel Tax Expenditure Plan

The Board of Trustees of the Walnut Valley Unified School District, serving
elementary, middle and high school students in the cities of Diamond Bar,
Walnut, West Covina, and Rowland Heights has evaluated the District’s urgent
and critical educational needs which will allow the District to maintain its
tradition of student achievement and academic excellence.

State budget cuts have forced the District to make approximately $8.5 Million in
budgetary cuts. Every dime possible has been cut from administrative and
management overhead as a first priority. However, extensive future cuts to the
classroom, including student education programs, are anticipated.

The District currently provides high quality public school education, with the
highest test scores locally. Its schools have received National Blue Ribbon and
California Distinguished School Honors.

To protect critical educational programs, ensure excellent teachers, and
maintain small class size, the Board of Trustees has identified the following
priorities for the parcel tax measure:

-	Ensuring qualified, credentialed teachers in every classroom;

-	Preventing increases in class sizes;

Improving teacher retention and recruitment;

-	Preventing cuts to music programs;

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE K

By Lloyd W. Pellman, County Counsel

Approval of Measure K would authorize the Walnut Valley Board of Trustees
(“Board”) to levy a qualified special tax in an amount not to exceed $148 per
parcel annually against each parcel of land in the Walnut Valley Unified School
District (“District”).

The lax revenues would be used to ensure qualified, credentialed teachers,
prevent increases in class sizes, cuts to music programs, middle and high school
electives such as foreign language, drama, technology, and industrial arts, and
after-school reading programs, improve teacher retention and recruitment,
replace outdated textbooks, reading materials, library books and instructional
supplies, and retain librarians and reading specialists.

The tax would be levied for six (6) years. A person age 65 or older may apply for
an exemption if they own and occupy a parcel as a principal residence. A parcel
is any unit of land in the District that now receives a separate tax bill. All
property that would otherwise be exempt from property taxes will also be
exempt.

The members of the Board, the Superintendent of the District, and officers of
the District, individually and collectively, shall provide accountability measures
pursuant to Government Code Section 50075.1 that include, but are not limited
to, a statement indicating the specific purposes of the qualified special tax, a
requirement that the proceeds be applied only to the specific purposes identified,
the creation of an independent citizens oversight committee, a special account
into which the proceeds shall be deposited, and an annual report pursuant to
Government Code Section 50075.3. The chief fiscal officer of the District shall
file a report with the Board no later than January 1, 2005, and at least once a
year thereafter. The report shall contain both the amount of funds collected and
expended, and the status of any project required or authorized to be funded as
identified.

The taxes under this Measure shall be collected by the Los Angeles County Tax
Collector-Treasurer at the same lime and manner and shall be subject to the
same penalties as general ad valorem property taxes collected by the tax
collector. The tax and penalty shall bear interest at the same rate for unpaid ad
valorem property taxes until paid.

This Measure requires a two-thirds (2/3) vote for passage.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE K

Improve teacher retention and prevent cuts to academic programs in Diamond
Bar, Walnut, West Covina, and Rowland Heights neighborhood schools - VOTE
YES on K.

Our local schools are recognized for academic excellence, receiving National
Blue Ribbon and California Distinguished School honors. Our students achieve
the highest test scores locally.

But Sacramento budget cuts threaten our ability to continue to provide local
students with excellent education. We’ve already cut $8 million in our schools.
Now, small class sizes and vital educational programs are at risk.

Studies have shown that kids are most likely to get in trouble in the hours right
after school lets out. Measure K saves after-school programs to keep our kids
safe, and away from gangs and drugs. And, Measure K will prevent increases in
class sizes because children are more likely to succeed if they receive extra
attention.

Measure K will ensure that our neighborhood schools continue to provide the
educational excellence you expect and deserve:

YES on K ensures qualified, eredentialed teachers in every classroom;

YES on K prevents increases in class sizes;

YES on K improves teacher retention and recruitment;

YES on K prevents cuts to music, foreign language, technology and industrial
arts programs and restores elementary science enrichment programs;

YES on K replaces outdated textbooks, library books and reading/ instructional
materials, and

YES on K prevents cuts to after-school reading programs.

Measure K is subject to strict fiscal accountability requirements. An Independent
Citizens’ Oversight Committee and guaranteed annual audits will ensure that all
money generated by Measure K is spent as promised. No money will go towards
administrators’ salaries
