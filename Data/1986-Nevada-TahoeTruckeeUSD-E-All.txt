IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY SCHOOLS’ ATTORNEY

MEASURE	1	\

A “YES” vote is a vote-to authorize the Board of Trustees of the Tahoe
Truckee Unified School District, hereinafter “District”, to levy and expend a
special tax' not to exceed the rates specified in the measure upon each
assessor’s parcel of land within the boundaries of the District for a period of
four (4) years to be used for the purposes specified iri the measure.

A “NO" vote is :a vote against the levy of the special tax,
f Articles XIII A and XIII B of the California Constitution and Government
Code Sections 7900J7913 and Sections 50075-50077 limit property taxes and
establish “appropriations limits" for local governmental agencies. Special
taxes may bo levied and a district’s "appropriations limit” may be increased
if authorized by the voters of the District; ■	'!

The District is seeking approval of the voters to levy an annual special
tax not to exceed the rates specified in the measure upon each assessor’s
parcel of land within the District for a period of four (4) years to be used for
the purposes specified in the measure and to increase the District appropria-
tions limit by an amount equal to the special tax.

If at least two-thirds (2/3) of the qualified electors voting on the measure
vote for approval, the measure will pass and become effective July 1,1986,
and will remain in effect for a period of four (4) years.

If at least two-thirds (2/3) of the qualified electors of the District voting on
the measure do not vote for approval, the measure will fall.

This special tax has no effect on the existing law and the electors who
will be entitled to vote on the measure will be those qualified electors who
reside within the boundaries of the Tahoe Truckee Unified School District.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE E

The Tahoe Truckee schools need your help. Our desire to provide the best
educational program possible is hampered by a serious lack of funds, despite
recent cutbacks and reductions in service. Our children deserve the best we
can provide, and a Yes vote on Measure E would take a giant stride toward
achieving excellence in education. The money generated from this measure
will be used for the following:
enhancing the quality and variety of academic subjects for all students
providing students with instructional materials and equipment
maintaining appropriate class size
providing adequate, health and safety standards
To maintain proper accountability a citizens advisory committee will advise
the Board of Trustees on the expenditure of the generated funds. Further-
more, 50% of each year's revenue during the four year life of Measure E
shall be retained in a separate interest bearing account, insuring continued
funding beyond 1990.

s/ Francis E. Mulholland, Superintendent
Tahoe Truckee Unified School District

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE E

The best way to make any complex problem even more confusing is to
assign it to a committee. The taxpayers already have a “committee’' duly
elected and given the power and authority to run our school district: the
school board. The proposed committee will be an advisory committee that
the school board can ignore completely, if it chooses. We taxpayers have no
assurances that any additional monies we give the board will be spent for
any of the programs WE think are important. That 50% of each year's
revenue will be set aside only means it could take longer to squander it on
projects favored by those who have the board’s ears.

Why doesn’t the board form a committee to study the real needs of the
district, draw up recommendations with specific estimates of dollar costs and
priorities and then come to the taxpayers with a request to fund these? Or
better still, have the district administration do it. There is no doubt that there
are needs in the district. One has only to visit any school to see these
needs. However, these needs have existed a long time, and they haven’t had
a high enough priority to get taken care of yet. Who says Measure E will do
.this now? Certainly, this ballot measure does not. Measure E is a carte
blanche, a blank check, an open credit line with no commitments to fix any-
thing except a mismanaged budget, Vote NO on Measure E.

s/ James E. Cutts

ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE E

Measure E is put forth for four noble reasons. However, they are like
Motherhood and Apple Pie, with no specific goals or objectives spelled out
that we, as taxpayers, can evaluate. The largest part of our property taxes
already go toward these aims. Why isn't this enough? The school district is
still working on the premise that money solves all problems. The administra-
tion steadfastly refuses to tell the taxpayers where the additional money will
be spent and what “academic subjects" will be “enhanced''. What do they
consider to be “appropriate” class sizes? What “instructional materials and
equipment" do we need? Where are the “health and safety standards", in-
adequate for all students? Words such as “enhanced", “appropriate”,
"materials and equipment” and "adequate" should frighten taxpayers whose
budgets are often more restrictive than the school district's! Using such
vocabulary leaves open how the money will be spent to anything from travel
allowance for a few district administrators and postage to moon probes.

Once more, the taxpayers are being asked to blindly support an adminis-
tration that spends what little money it can control on new football fields and
other frills. Let them give us a list of what is needed, and then we can
decide whether we agree with them, or not.

Until the school district can spell out the specific programs, with dollar
amounts committed to each, and is willing to dedicate additional tax monies
to these, you are urged to VOTE NO on Measure E.

si James E. Cutts

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE E

The argument against Measure E is based on the premise that the district
is unwilling to spell out specific programs, choosing to identify areas of
expenditures in “glittering generalities." It further registers little confidence in
an administration whose spending record is questionable at best.

First, in addressing the credibility of the administration it must be under-
stood that this is a new administration, who, in its short tenure, has demon-
strated fiscal integrity.

Secondly, the specific list ot needs are endless: we’ll need 6 teachers at
$165,000. to maintain our present class sizes, $16,000. is needed to replace
all student desks purchased before 1965, the roofs at Tahoe Lake and
Rideout Schools will cost $70,000. to repair, the science labs at Tahoe
Truckee High will take $28,000. to refurbish, there’s a $120,000. price tag to
rehire our custodians, and the list goes on and on/

Understand, it is the elected Board of Trustees who are ultimately respon-
sible to the people, and it is the people’s responsibility to insure that the
Board reflects the will of the majority. That, in part, explains why an advi-
sory committee will be created to monitor Board actions. That is, in itself,
relatively simple, for all expenditures are a matter of public record, debated
and voted upon, in public session.
