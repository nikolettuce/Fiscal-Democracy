RANCHO ADOBE FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT
MEASUREJ

Shall the Rancho Adobe Rre Protection District levy a

J maximum special tax of $6.25 per unit of risk each year for
15 years (through fiscal year 2021-22) to repay bonds
issued for its Community Facilities District No. 2006-1 to
finance purchase and rehabilitation of fire equipment and facilities
(including 5 new fire trucks and repairs to the District’s three fire
stations), and shall the maximum bond amount and appropriations
limit be $2,100,000?

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE J

If Measure J is on your ballot, the Rancho Adobe Fire Protection District firefighters
are the first responders if you experience a fire or medical emergency. A “yes” vote
on this measure will ensure the continued safety of you, your family and firefighters-
by providing funding to replace dangerously obsolete emergency vehicles and to
repair the District’s three fire stations. The cost of these critical public safety items
for single family households will be $25 per year for only the 15 years the proposed
bonds are outstanding.

The District will use the bond funds to meet the following critical needs: Replace 5
old fire trucks that are between 22 and 28 years old, are experiencing expensive
and lengthy breakdowns and no longer comply with established safety standards.
Reliable, safe vehicles are absolutely essential for firefighter safety and for their
ability to respond to emergencies on a timely basis. Replace a power generator at
the Liberty Valley Station. Make the following long-deferred repairs: Replace the
roof of the Penngrove Station, which has totally deteriorated and is leaking; replace
the driveways at the Penngrove and Liberty stations, which are broken and hazard-
ous; replace the worn out floor coverings in the Cotati and Penngrove stations,
which are tripping hazards and repair and paint the exterior of the Cotati Station.
We believe these repairs must be made immediately because the stations must of-
fer safe conditions for our firefighters and to the community. Finally, passage of
Measure J will allow the District to establish vehicle replacement reserves from
other District funds, permitting the District to replace its vehicles on a timely basis in
the future, without requesting additional bonds for that purpose.

Please join us and vote “Yes” on Measure J for the safety of our community and our
firefighters.

pancy has been issued for residential use be increased by more than 10% as a
