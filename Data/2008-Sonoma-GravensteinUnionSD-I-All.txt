GRAVENSTEIN UNION SCHOOL DISTRICT
MEASURE I

To continue to provide our students with courses in the arts

I and music, as well as technology instruction, all essential for
student growth and development, shall the Gravenstein
Union School District be authorized to levy a qualified special
tax of $45 per year on each parcel of taxable real property in the
District for no more than eight years, commencing July 1,2009,
after the expiration of the existing parcel tax, with annual audits
and an exemption for seniors?

COUNTY COUNSEL’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE I

The Gravenstein Union School District has called an election on a special tax
measure to fund educational programs. State law requires voter approval before
a school district can impose a special tax.

The District is proposing to levy a special tax of $45 per year on each parcel of
taxable real property in the District, commencing on July 1,2009, when the existing
parcel tax expires. The tax would be levied for no more than eight years.

Proceeds of the tax would be placed in a special fund and could only be used for
the purposes set out in the measure, which include providing technology instruc-
tion and courses in the arts and music.

Each year that tax funds remain unspent, an independent financial auditor will pre-
pare and present a report to the Board of Trustees stating (1) the amount of funds
received and expended during the prior year, and (2) the status of any projects or
description of any programs funded by the tax. The report must be filed by Decem-
ber 31 of each year. The period covered by the report may be a fiscal or calendar
year, or other appropriate annual period, as determined by the Superintendent.

The tax would be applied to each unit of real property in the District that receives a
separate tax bill for property taxes. Multiple parcels that are contiguous and are
part of one economic unit under the same name and ownership and that do not
receive separate tax bills would be charged as one parcel. Parcels which are ex-
empt from property tax, or on which no property tax is otherwise levied, are also
exempt from this tax. The measure also exempts from the tax parcels owned or
partially owned and occupied by a person who is 65 years of age or older. Persons
claiming exemptions based on ownership by a senior citizen would need to apply to
the District for this exemption by May 1 of the first year the exemption applies to
them.

If two-thirds of the voters in the Gravenstein Union School District who vote on this
measure vote "yes," the measure will pass and the special tax will be levied. The
tax would be collected in the same manner as regular property taxes.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE I

Please vote Yes on Measure 1 to help maintain strong music, art and technology
instruction in our local Gravenstein schools.

Despite limited state funding that ranks California 47lh out of 50 states, the
Gravenstein Union School District provides an excellent education for all our stu-
dents. Gravenstein has topped West Sonoma County in reading and math test
scores for six straight years. Hillcrest Middle School students have led all of
Sonoma County for four of the last eight years. Their success helps keep our
schools thriving and property values strong. But our kids need your Yes vote on
Measure I to continue to excel.

Our Gravenstein schools have stretched scarce resources to the limit by eliminat-
ing waste and focusing on classrooms and students. They’re supported by two
dedicated parent foundations that contribute what they'can to arts, foreign lan-
guage instruction and computers for our students. And since 2001, our schools
have relied on generous community support through a parcel tax. That money has
funded investments in our libraries, computer technology, and one of Sonoma
County’s finest music and performing arts programs. But this community support
will end next year—unless you vote Yes on Measure I.

Measure I renews the current assessment with a small adjustment for inflation to
$45/year. It is limited to eight years. Seniors 65 and older qualify for an exemption,
and contiguous parcels are assessed only once.

Through careful management of limited state funds, and hard work by dedicated
teachers and staff, Gravenstein schools give our students an excellent basic edu-
cation. But they rely on additional funds from our parents and our community to
provide music, arts and technology instruction so our children can thrive in the 21st
Century.

Please support our kids by voting Yes on Measure I! Thank you very much.
