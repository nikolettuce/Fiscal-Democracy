CTTV ATTORNEY IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
Of MEASURE N

Measure "N" on the ballot provides “Shall the proposed ordinance repealing City-Wide Park Maintenance
District 98-1 be approval?’"

flic full text of the proposed ordinance follows this Impartial Analysis. The ordinance will not be effective
unless and until approved by a vote of not less than a majority of those voting on (his Measure and provided
further that this Measure receives more affirmative votes than Measure“M” which also appears on the ballot.

The ordinance is on the ballot because of the Initiative Measure to Repeal City-Wide Park Maintenance-

Assessment District 98-1

The ordinance would dissolve City-Wide Park Maintenance Assessment District 98-1 In April 1998,
Brentwood property owners voted to assess themselves a maximum $79 a year, per single family dwelling,
to maintain park and recreational facilities in Brentwood Other land uses, such as multi-family, commercial,
public property and agricultural, were also assessed at different amounts. The ordinance would terminate the
park, assessments

The ordinance also directs that all funds that have been collected for park maintenance be transferred to the
City's general fund, it purports to repeal the levy of assessments for Fiscal Year 1998-99 and orders the City
to discontinue collection of the assessments. It purports to ban the City from forming a similar District or
levying assessments on property owners in the City for park maintenance, but would allow the City to propose
for voter approval a special tax for park maintenance One of the differences between a park maintenance
assessment district and a special tax is that a special tax requires two-thirds voter approval at an election
whereas an assessment district requires a majority approval by those property owners submitting ballots.
Finally, the ordinance could only be amended by a vote of the People,

The above objectives of the ordinance are extensively regulated by the California Constitution and other State
laws and it is not dear how the provisions of the ordinance would be interpreted by the Courts.

A 'yes’ vote means you are m favor of Measure “N“ and the repeal of the City’s park maintenance funding
program and a 'no' vote means you are opposed to Measure “N" and support the City’s park maintenance
funding program.

MEASURE N
TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 3,1998

The $79 tax which increases at two percent per year is excessive. There are more economical alternatives
that would guarantee well maintained parks.

For the past fiscal year ending June 30 1998, the city spent $223000 to maintain 28.5 acres of parks at $7825
per acre.

In a July 28 1998 memorandum requested by the city , a parks subcommittee conservatively estimated the
cost of maintaining future parks at $10000 per acre.

in a July 31 1998 news item, the city parks consultant reported that it would take $1.4 million annually to
maintain the parks the city has planned which amount is in addition to the current funding which comes from
lighting and landscaping districts.

A city park tax measure in 1993 failed by more than a 3 to 1 vote.

Similarly, the city of Antioch sent an ill-fated measure to the November 1997 ballot and the measure felled

by more than 2 to 1, The city then called for bids from private contractors and received a bid of $300000 a

year to maintain the city's 26 parks totaling 190 acres and saving the taxpayers $! million.

Antioch’s cost of $300000 to maintain 190 acres versus Brentwood’s cost of $223000 to maintain just 28.5
acres is a big difference m maintenance costs.

The mayor said the parks would be built even if the fax is repealed.

To eliminate the excessive $79 tax vote YES.

MEASURE N
TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 3,1998

Measure N sponsors fail to lei! you the $79.00 Park Maintenance fax is not a fixed dollar amount but a
"worst case scenario” figure the City was required to develop as background information for Brentwood
property owners under State Proposition 218.

The proponents fail to point out it cannot exceed $79 00 annually without another vote of the property owners

and that actual projections suggest a rate around $50.00 will be assessed by the year 2000. Park maintenance
dollars are held in a separate fund. At years end any balance carried over to the next assessment year, reduces

that years assessment.

Opponents fail to point out this process ensures close public scrutiny by requiring public hearings each year
before the City Council can adopt and approve any park, assessment.

T he opponents claim City park maintenance costs are too high, but fail to tell you the existing maintenance
of City parks are done by the separate Brentwood Recreation and Park District. Measure M creates greater

6

accountability for park maintenance by placing this under your elected City Council’s control and creates
an open bidding procedure ensuring the highest quality of work at lowest possible cost, just as the opponents ,
want

Hundreds of Brentwood property owners now pay park maintenance fees, while others like the leaders of
Measure N pay nothing. This is unfair. A City-wide program of community parks benefits everyone and treats
everyone the same

Vote for the future Vote No on Measure N.

ARGUMENT AGAINST

MEASUREN
TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 3,1998

In an effort to create a fair and accessible program of community parks, property owners voted to assess
themselves $79 00 per parcel tax this past April

This electoral process provided votes based on property values. While the City Council did make sure a
weighted vote was established for various segments of properties a number of votes came from large land
owners and developers This was not a City designated plan, but a result of who actually voted not who was
eligible since just 50% of all the 6,025 eligible parcels voted Opponents to this park effort now seek to
overturn this vote and eliminate City funding for the maintenance of the community park effort. The
opponents have said parks aren’t needed, that a community swimming pool and baseball and soccer fields
are unneeded and a waste of money

The opponents could have sought to modify this approved proposal, but have chosen to seek outright repeal
thus terminating and wasting the dollars spent to acquire community park sites and design work for these
parks These parks are ready to move forward in 1999, but can’t without long-term support for their
maintenance. Measure N ignores that a community that invests in it’s youth and provides recreational and
open space opportunities for its residents help create a higher quality of life for all. This leads to better
schools, higher property values and lower levels of crime Brentwood schools now have 7,500young people
enrolled in them and is growing every year The opponents suggest using schools, but schools are hard pressed
to provide adequate facilities for their organized sports teams and provide literally no recreational
opportunities for the majority of Brentwood residents.

The opponents see a City without community parks. Vote no on Measure N and vote for a brighter future
for Brentwood

The city has falsely accused us of saying parks aren’t needed and swimming pools arid baseball and soccer
fields are a waste of money.

It’s a waste of money the way the city is doing it at $7825 an acre for a total cost of $223000 for 28.5 acres.
Antioch using private contractors trimmed their maintenance costs to $300000 for 190.2 acres

7

The mayor said the parks would he built even if the tax is repealed

the city contends the schools are hard pressed to provide facilities for organized sports and provide no
opportunities for a majority of residents.

We think it would be advantageous for the city to join with the schools in partnership and avert duplication
of facilities and reduce maintenance costs.

The city continues to find ways to squander taxpayers money.

The garbage fiasco cost $2 million

Replacing cracked PLASTIC water lines to residences will take $2 million

The defunct water filtration plant to use surplus EBMUD water cost $1 million

The western sanitary PLASTIC sewer line installed in 1991 at a cost of$4.7 million is self-destructing and
would probably cost double that amount to replace currently,

The city recently received an estimate of $764200 for temporary repairs The city has made repairs on their
own, had two civil engineering inspections and had a television survey done

Alter? years, the firms that designed, built and inspected the line, have paid NOTHING for the repairs and
inspections

Vote YES on measure N
