IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
CITY OF SAND CITY MEASURE F

The Sand City Municipal Code presently imposes a tax on rental
of hotel rooms in the City which is commonly referred to as a ‘transient
occupancy tax.' The existing rate of the tax is 8% of the amount
charged for the hotel room. A majority vote in favor of this proposition
would enable the Sand City Council to act at any time to increase
/ or decrease the rate of transient occupancy tax charged in Sand City
from a minimum of 8% to a maximum of 14%. If this measure fails
to pass, the City Council will not have the authority to increase the
rate of the tax above 8%.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE F

On 7/18/00, the Sand City Council approved a ballot proposition for
the 11/07/00 election to increase the tax rate on hotel occupancies.
Upon approval, this ballot measure would authorize an increase in
the transient occupancy tax (TOT) for Sand City from the current 8%
rate to a new range of 8% to 14% depending on implementing action
by the City Council.

It must be emphasized that this tax would NOT be levied on Sand
City residents. This tax would be applied only to visitors occupying
one of the proposed hotels in Sand City. Presently Ihere are not any
hotels in Sand City. However, there are two hotel projects being
proposed for the coastal area and other proposals for smaller hotel
projects on the eastern side of Sand City.

Sand City needs to diversify its economic base. In FY 2000, Sand
City is too dependent on sales taxes which represent 50% of the
City’s regular revenues. The retail industry is constantly changing
with new shopping centers and shifting trends in customer buying
habits. Frequently, the California Legislature considers proposed
legislation that would change the sales tax distribution to California
cities. Consequently, Sand City has been pursuing a General Plan
goal to develop a new revenue source for the City (TOT on hotel
room rates).

Sand City’s current TOT rate is only 8% while the average for the
Monterey County area is 10.4%. A recent survey revealed the following
TOT rates: Carmel, Monterey City, Pacific Grove 10%; Seaside 12%;
Monterey County 10.5%; San Francisco 13.5%; Anaheim 15%.

To increase the TOT rate, a ballot measure must be approved by
Sand City’s voters. These new TOT revenues would go to the Sand
City "general fund" for improving and maintaining general Sand City
programs. The voters are requested to approve this new TOT range
(8-14%) with the City Council being authorized to establish the actual
rate within the approved range.
