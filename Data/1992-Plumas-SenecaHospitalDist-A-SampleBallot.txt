ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE A

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL
SENECA HOSPITAL DISTRICT
MEASURE A

If approved by a two-third vote, this special tax commencing July 1, 1993,
would be used for hospital purposes within the Seneca Hospital District. The tax
levied is $75 per year for each improved parcel of real property, and $50 per
year for each unimproved parcel. A fax levy of a lesser amount would be within
the discretion of the District Board of Directors, to be decided annually during
each of the eight years that the tax would be in effect. A “Yes" vote approves
of the tax, while a “No" vote opposes the tax.

s/ Robert Shulman
County Counsel

THIS IS A PROPOSAL TO REDUCE TAXES. AT THE PRESENT TIME THE SPECIAL
TAX IS $90.00 FOR IMPROVED PARCELS AND $60.00 FOR UNIMPROVED PAR-
CELS. THIS PROPOSAL IS FOR $75.00 FOR IMPROVED PARCELS AND $50.00
FOR UNIMPROVED PARCELS.

Seneca District Hospital is a well-managed facility which serves over 5000 pa-
tients annually. Services offered include acute care, surgery, maternity care,
skilled nursing care, a broad range of outpatient services, emergency room,
ambulance service, x-ray, lab, respiratory therapy, stress testing, and endoscopy
procedures. Continuation of these services and addition of new ones is important
to the health and welfare of our entire community.

The hospital is a key factor in attracting and keeping quality doctors in the
community.

Both the federal and state governments, which underpay for services at present,
are proposing further reductions in payments for healthcare. Such actions would
have a serious impact on Seneca, since 65% of the hospital revenue comes
from these programs.

In addition to providing excellent healthcare to the community, Seneca is the
second largest employer in the area, with over 100 employees. Supporting this
REDUCED TAX will have a significant economic impact on both the economy
and property values in the area. Reduction or loss of hospital services and jobs
could be devastating.

We have no choice, we must support this issue. Where else can we get so
much value for about 20 cents a day!
