Board Meeting: January 8, 1991

IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES CONSIDER INITIATING A
SPECIAL PARCEL AND BOND TAX ELECTION IN JUNE OF 1991.

DISTRICT GOAL/

OBJECTIVE:	Goal	#2 Work towards the achievement of the highest quality educational

program for all students.

Objective 2.1 Continue efforts to refine existing and implement new
programs and curriculum.

Objective 2.3 Evaluate our existing Early Childhood Education and
Kindergarten programs taking into consideration other program options.

Objective 2.5 Implement a long-range plan for the reduction of class size.

Goal #3 Establish an attitude and make a commitment that all facilities
and work environments will be safe, functional, attractive, and
professional.

Objective 3.1 Implement a long-range plan that will make our facilities
attractive, professional, safe, functional learning environments.

Objective 4.1 Identify and seek financial resources to support the
educational program.

BACKGROUND:	In	July 1990, the Board took action to initiate a parcel and bond tax

election in November of 1990. With this action an extensive campaign
was launched in an effort to communicate to voters the needs of the
School District that would be addressed if the voters approved each
measure. Despite the fact that we ran an excellent campaign and exceeded
our goal of 18,000 yes votes by over 2000 votes, both measures failed to
acquire the two-thirds vote required for passage. The parcel tax, Measure
B, had a favorable vote of 61 % and the bond, Measure C, received 59%.
The reasons for the defeat of each measure were probably more
attributable to external factors rather than the intent of the measures
themselves. Likely causes were:

•	The crisis in the Middle East that started on August 2, 1990.

•	The increasing cost of oil caused by the Middle East crisis.

•	A downturn in the economy. . .which resulted in a more conservative
mentality on the part of many voters.

Prolonged State and national budget deliberations.

•	A negative attitude towards incumbents which resulted in the successful
passage of proposition 140. . .which limits the term of office for State
legislators.

•	An unusually long and complicated ballot.

•	Voter discontent with propositions that cost money. Only one
Statewide bond measure out of 13 successfully passed in November.
In comparison since 1984, all State bond measures but one had been
successful.

Many of the above situations have not changed since November. In
particular, the crisis in the Middle East is an even greater concern and the
economic forecast is not overly optimistic. One could argue that this is
not the time, but I’m not sure there will ever be a perfect time. We have
needs and we must continue to express them.

The advantages of a June election are:

•	The measures will stand on their own. They won’t be mixed in with
a complex and long State and local ballot.

•	Parents and key community members continue to be enthusiastic about
our cause and have indicated they will continue to work hard
throughout the campaign. Their continued involvement is critical if
you should decide to launch a campaign.

•	There will still be a high level of understanding of the measures and
our needs.

•	The district’s financial picture has worsened in the last few months
which makes our need even greater. It also means we will be taking
further steps this spring to reduce expenditures.

The disadvantages are:

•	The current recession. The economy continues to decline but some
economic forecasts are indicating we could see some improvement by
late spring. •

•	The crisis in the Middle East continues but hopefully it will be over
one way or the other very soon.

DESCRIPTION

DETAILS:

FISCAL

IMPACT:

Prepared By:

•	The cost of a special election is greater than a regular election. It’s
estimated that the election and outside support costs could cost the
District $150,000 to $200,000. These costs can be paid for from the
bond if it’s successful. The major portion of this expense
(approximately $150,000-$180,000) would be the cost of the election.
We could experience some criticism for expending the District’s
limited resources in this manner.

•	It’s not likely that we will have the same level of success generating
campaign donations. This will require increased volunteerism if we
are going to successfully communicate our needs. It may also require
some modifications in our campaign strategy.

The question that will have to be answered by all of us and decided by the
Board at its January 22rtd meeting is ~ Do the advantages outweigh the
disadvantages?

If the Board should decide to authorize a bond and parcel tax election, the
elements of each measure will have to be determined. For the November
election the measures included the following:

Measure B (Parcel tax. . .$55.00 oer parcel)

•	Reduce class size K-3 to an average of 24 to 1 and grades 4-8 to 27
to 1.

•	Improve school libraries.

•	Improve the school district’s physical education program.

•	Improve the school district’s fine arts program.

Measure C ($33.000.000 Bond. . .average cost of $12.66 per year for
the life of the bonds which is 30 years)

•	Rehabilitate the school district’s facilities.

•	Where necessary, expand existing sites or reopen closed sites.

•	Acquire additional sites if necessary.

At this meeting, we would like to review the objective of each measure
and like to ask the Board to consider a modification in Measure B. If the
Board should decide to move forward, the purpose of each measure will
have to be stated in the ballot language. The filina deadline for the .Tune
election is February 1. 1991. A decision will have to be made at the
January 22, 1991 Board meeting.

None at present. If the Board authorizes the election, $150,000 -
$200,000 will be required from the special reserve.

Objective 4.1 Identify and seek financial resources to support the
educational program.

BACKGROUND:	At	our	last	regular	Board	meeting,	the	administration reviewed the pros

and cons of placing measures on the June, 1991, ballot in an effort to
bring increased resources to the school district. The attachment to this
agenda item is the agenda item that appeared before the Board on January
8, 1991. It states some of the reasons the administration believes caused
the measures’ defeat in November of 1990 and goes on to speak to some
of the advantages and disadvantages for having the measures on the June
ballot.

/a-S'

	The administration is recommending that the Board of Trustees take the necessary legal steps to be on the June ballot pending a final decision in late February. In making this recommendation, we are suggesting that we watch closely the world’s situation and changes in the economy for the next five to six weeks. Then, if in late February or early March the Board feels it’s not appropriate to go forward with the election in June, the decision could be reversed and the measures removed from the ballot at no cost to the District. If the decision is reversed, the Board will then be considering at that time the possibility of placing these measures on the November, 1991, ballot.  We are also recommending that you direct the administration to bring back language that would be incorporated in the class size reduction section of the parcel tax that allows the school district to use a portion of the tax income to maintain current class sizes. If this concept were acceptable to the Board, it would lessen the need to reduce the 1991-92 budget by approximately $500,000. If this direction is given, there would be adequate resources available to reduce class size to 25/1 for grades K through 3, and 27/1 for grades 4 through 8 which was part of the original plan for Measure B. It will, however, make it impossible to address the other elements of the original Measure B which were intended to improve libraries, PE and fine arts.
DESCRIPTION  DETAILS:	The Board requested during its discussion of this item two weeks ago a status report on the special reserve. The administration will be reviewing this information for the Board as part of this agenda item.
FISCAL  IMPACT:	Up to $55,000,000 in additional revenues over a ten year period.

BACKGROUND:	In	January,	the Board of Trustees, after lengthy discussions,

directed the administration to take the legal steps necessary
to hold an election on June 4, 1991 on Measures B and C.

In doing so, the Board modified Measure B so that it deals
exclusively with class size reductions (25:1 at grades K-2 and
27:1 at grades 3-8) and provides $500,000 toward reducing
the District’s deficit for educational programs.

The Board of Trustees also directed that another Board
discussion be held in March to determine the level of
community support for staging and election and to consider
the impact of any changes in the world situation and/or the
economy.

/O. A

RESOLUTION 4/90-91 OF THE BOARD OF
TRUSTEES OF THE SAN MATEO CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT
PROPOSING A QUALIFIED SPECIAL TAX AND
ESTABLISHING SPECIFICATIONS OF THE ELECTION ORDER

WHEREAS, the San Mateo City School District ("District") has been forced to eliminate
and curtail many essential educational services due to inadequate funding from the State
Legislature; and

WHEREAS, increased revenues are necessary to continue meeting the students’ basic
educational needs; and

WHEREAS, the District has engaged in a variety of efforts to generate funds for the
District’s educational program, including lobbying in the State Legislature, local fundraising
efforts, and cost-cutting measures, but these efforts have not produced sufficient revenues; and

WHEREAS, Section 4 of Article XIIIA of the California Constitution and Government
Code Section 50079 authorize a school district, upon approval of two-thirds of the electorate
voting on the measure, to levy a qualified special tax for specified purposes following notice
and public hearing; and

WHEREAS, this Board believes that such a qualified special tax is necessary to provide
an adequate educational opportunity for the students of this District; and

WHEREAS, the annual appropriations limit of the District should be raised concurrently
to allow the District to expend the amounts raised by said tax.

THEREFORE, be it resolved that:

1.	This Board hereby proposes to adopt a qualified special tax to maintain the District’s
instructional programs and to reduce class sizes to at least 25:1 at grades K-2 and 27:1 at grades
3-8.

2.	Said qualified special tax shall be in an amount not to exceed $55 per year assessed
against each parcel of taxable land in the District. This may be changed annually by the change
in the Consumer Price Index for California.

A parcel shall be defined as any unit of land in the District which now receives a separate
tax bill from the San Mateo County Assessor’s Office provided that upon application an
exemption will be granted for parcels owned and occupied by a person 65 years of age or older.
All property which would otherwise be exempt from property taxes will also be exempt from
the imposition of said special tax.

3.	In connection with the proposal of said special tax, this Board further proposes to
increase the District’s appropriations limit per fiscal year, in an amount equal to the levy of
special taxes for said year, as permitted by Article XIIIB, Section 4 of the California
Constitution.

4.	This Board hereby requests that the San Mateo County Clerk (the "County Clerk") to
submit to the voters of this District on June 4, 1991 the following ballot measure:

"Shall the San Mateo City (elementary) School District, for the benefit of
students in San Mateo and Foster City, be authorized to impose a qualified
