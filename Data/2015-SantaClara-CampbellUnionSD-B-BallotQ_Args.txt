Arguments in favor

The Yes on Measure B website featured the following argument in favor of Measure

B;[si

Our local Campbell Union Elementary School District provides the children in our
Campbell, San Jose, Saratoga, Los Gatos, Santa Clara and Monte Sereno
neighborhoods with a well-rounded education. With highly qualified teachers who
deliver excellent classroom instruction, our students enter high school with a strong
foundation in the core academic subjects that are essential for success in college and
future careers.

To continue improving student achievement, Measure B is critical.

Unreliable state education funding has impacted our schools for decades. That’s
why school districts in our area have passed locally controlled, voter-approved
funding to protect educational programs and retain teachers.

Campbell Union Elementary School District is the only district in our area that is
not supported by a local funding measure like Measure B.

Measure B will provide stable, local funding to retain teachers and improve
academic programs for the students in our neighborhoods. The state cannot take
away a single penny.

Vote Yes on B for student success.

•	Maintain excellent core academic programs in reading, writing, math and
hands-on science

•	Retain highly qualified teachers and ensure new teachers have adequate
training and support

•	Keep schools safe, clean and well-maintained

•	Provide support for struggling students and advanced courses for high-
performing students

Measure B includes strong fiscal accountability provisions.

•	Every penny of Measure B stays in our neighborhood schools and cannot be
taken by the state

•	Independent citizen oversight ensures all funds will be spent as promised

•	No funds can be used for administrators' salaries

•	Homeowners age 65 and older are eligible for an exemption

Measure B expires in 8 years and cannot be renewed without voter approvals
