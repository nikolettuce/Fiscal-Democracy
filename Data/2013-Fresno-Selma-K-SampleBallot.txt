IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY

CITY OF SELMA TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX INCREASE MEASURE
[ELECTIONS CODE SECTION 9280]

The City of Selma has an existing transient occupancy tax (TOT). The existing rate of the tax is 6% of what is charged by the operator
of any hotel, motel or similar lodging for a period of less than thirty (30) days. The tax is paid by visitors, travelers and others who stay
in hotels or similar lodging within the City and is not a direct tax on residents of the City. The TOT has not been increased since 1982.
On July 1, 2013, the City Council of the City of Selma adopted a Resolution calling for a City wide municipal election to be consoli-
dated with the general election on November 5, 2013, on Measure “K” the “City of Selma Transient Occupancy Tax Increase Measure.”
Measure “K” provides for an increase in the transient occupancy tax from six percent (6%) to twelve percent (12%) of the rate charged
to the transient for the privilege of occupying any room or rooms in any inn, hotel, motel, or lodging within the City for a period of less
than thirty (30) days. The measure and the implementing ordinance adopted by the Selma City Council will amend that part of existing
City ordinances which imposes the tax by increasing the tax rate from six percent (6%) to twelve percent (12%) and changing the name
of the existing City ordinance from the “Transient Room Tax Ordinance” to the “Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance.”

SMKE-1

FR 003-005

The City is authorized to impose the transient occupancy tax pursuant to Revenue and Taxation Code §7280. The existing transient
occupancy tax and the 6% increase of the tax provided for by Measure K and the implementing ordinance is a general tax in that the
revenues from the 6% increase may be used for any general governmental purposes. Article VIIIC of the California Constitution (Propo-
sition 218) requires the increase in the tax rate be approved by a majority vote of the electorate. In adopting the resolution which places
this measure on the ballot, the City Council unanimously found that the increase is necessary to fund added expense of providing City
service generally and of providing parks and recreation, arts and cultural activities for persons who are non-residents that stay in City
hotels and motels.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Ordinance No. 2013-4 and Measure “K.” If you desire a copy of the Ordinance or Mea-
sure, please call the Elections Official’s office at (559) 488-3246 and a copy will be mailed at no cost to you.

s/Neal E. Costanzo
City Attorney for the City of Selma

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE K

Most cities impose a Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) at a specified percentage of the rate or rental charged by an operator of any
hotel, motel or other temporary lodging within the city. Selma currently imposes a TOT of 6% of the rate charged by the hotel or motel
operator. The rate was set in 1982 and has never been adjusted for inflation. The rate charged by most neighboring cities is 12%.
Approval of the Measure will increase the rate of Selma’s TOT to 12%.

The TOT is not a tax that is charged to or paid by residents of the City, unless that resident stays at a Selma hotel or motel. It is paid
by persons who visit or travel to Selma and stay in hotels or motels within the City.

The TOT funds the added expense of providing City services generally, including parks and recreation and cultural activities for
persons who are not residents of the City. The increase in the TOT tax rate will allow for the continuing funding of the added expense of
providing City services to persons who are not residents of our City so that the added expense is not required to be subsidized by City
residents. Even with no new hotels or motels in the City, the rate increase will immediately double the revenues available to the City
from the TOT for providing City services, and for enhancing its park, recreational, art and cultural activities and facilities to attract even
more visitors who contribute to economic activity within the City.

Please vote “yes” on Measure K and help us ensure that our City maintains sufficient revenues to continue to provide quality City
services and facilities both for residents and visitors.
