The Top Two Candidates Open Primary Act, which took effect January 1, 2011, requires that all candidates for a voter-nominated
office be listed on the same ballot. Voter-nominated offices are state legislative offices, U.S. congressional offices, and state
constitutional offices.

In both the open primary and general elections, you can vote for any candidate, regardless of what party preference you indicated
on your voter registration form. In the primary election, the two candidates receiving the most votes—regardless of party
preference—move on to the general election regardless of vote totals. If a candidate receives a majority of the vote (50 percent +
1), a general election still must be held. Even if there are only two candidates for an office in the open primary, a general election
for that office is still required.

California’s open primary system does not apply to candidates running for local offices.

Voter-Nominated Offices

Political parties are not entitled to formally nominate candidates for voter-nominated offices at the primary election. A
candidate nominated for a voter-nominated office at the primary election is the nominee of the people and not the official nominee
of any party at the general election. A candidate for nomination to a voter-nominated office shall have his or her party preference,
or lack of party preference, stated on the ballot, but the party preference designation is selected solely by the candidate and is
shown for the information of the voters only. It does not mean the candidate is nominated or endorsed by the party designated,
or that there is an affiliation between the party and candidate, and no candidate nominated by the voters shall be deemed to be
the officially nominated candidate of any political party. In the county sample ballot booklet, parties may list the candidates for
voter-nominated offices who have received the party’s official endorsement.

Any voter may vote for any candidate for a voter-nominated office, if they meet the other qualifications required to vote
for that office. The top two vote-getters at the primary election move on to the general election for the voter-nominated office even
if both candidates have specified the same party preference designation. No party is entitled to have a candidate with its party
preference designation move on to the general election, unless the candidate is one of the two highest vote-getters at the primary
election.

Nonpartisan State Offices

Political parties are not entitled to nominate candidates for nonpartisan offices at the primary election, and a candidate
at the primary election is not the official nominee of any party for the specific office at the general election. A candidate for
nomination to a nonpartisan office may not designate his or her party preference, or lack of party preference, on the ballot. The
top two vote-getters at the primary election move on to the general election for the nonpartisan office.

New electoral district boundaries are drawn every 10 years in order to equalize district populations. Boundaries for the
congressional, state legislative, and county supervisorial districts are now different. Boundary changes also apply to any city,
school district, or special district that votes by trustee areas or divisions. To see the new district maps, visit the Registrar of
Voters website at www.voteinfo.net.

CANDIDATE STATEMENT FOR
UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE,

36TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT

BRIAN NESTANDE, Republican	AGE:	50

OCCUPATION:	State Assemblyman / Businessman

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

Congress isn’t getting anything done, and the current Congress is
one of history's worst.

In Congress, I'll work to:

S Immediately secure the border as the FIRST step in immigration
reform

s STOP the overspending and pass a balanced budget
amendment

s Hold Congress accountable - no balanced budget = no
paycheck

s Create policies that encourage businesses to expand so we
have high quality good paying jobs

Middle class families cannot afford another do-nothing Congress. In
the last two years, Congress sent America another $2 trillion deeper
into debt - an amount equal to an additional $9,000 of debt per U.S.
taxpayer.

At the same time, the cost of healthcare under Obamacare has risen
by as much as fifty percent, and millions of seniors have seen their
Medicare benefits reduced.

Worker wages have remained stagnant, and more businesses are
moving off-shore as Congress debates adding even higher taxes and
more regulations.

My wife Gina and I are raising our family and we know first-hand how
difficult Washington is making it for middle class families to get ahead.

I’ll make sure the priorities of seniors and middle-class families
are put into action, and that's the difference. That’s why I’ve been
endorsed by most of the local elected leaders in our District - people
who understand how difficult it’s been to have a voice in Congress. I
would be honored to have your vote.

CANDIDATE STATEMENT FOR
STATE SENATOR,

28TH SENATORIAL DISTRICT

JEFF STONE, Republican

OCCUPATION:	Riverside County Supervisor / Small Business

Owner

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

As a Riverside County Supervisor and longtime small business
owner, I’m proud to be running for the Senate with the support of
local taxpayers, seniors, veterans, small business owners and over
45 city council members and elected officials from the Coachella
Valley and Riverside County. Councilman Glenn Miller, who ran a
strong campaign in June, has now endorsed me.

I’m also honored to be the choice of Riverside Countv Sheriff Stan Sniff
and the Riverside Sheriffs Association. Over 3,200 law enforcement
officers and investigators in Riverside County endorse me because
they know I will OPPOSE EARLY RELEASE of dangerous prisoners
and work to keep our neighborhoods, schools and homes safe.

I signed the NO NEW TAXES pledge. As a local official, I successfully
lowered taxes without cutting vital services. I’ll work to do the same
in Sacramento.

I strongly oppose the federal government’s policy of moving illegal
immigrants from the Texas border to Riverside County communities.
The Feds need to enforce the law and control the border.

My priorities are: JOB CREATION and Improving the Business
Climate; No New Taxes, Cut Waste and Balance the Budget.

Special interests in Sacramento are spending massive sums of
money to influence your vote and defeat me. Ask yourself: do you
want a Senator who will be a voice for the special interests; or one
who will be a voice for you and Riverside County?

I’d be honored to receive your vote. Please visit www.JeffStone2014.com

CANDIDATE STATEMENT FOR
STATE SENATOR,

28TH SENATORIAL DISTRICT

BONNIE GARCIA, Republican
OCCUPATION:	Small Business Woman

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

California is broken and in dire need of commonsense solutions.

During the six years I served in the Assembly, I kept my promise
and refused to support tax increases and reckless spending. My
commitment to California’s hardworking taxpayers earned me the
support of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association and local elected
officials from across the county.

A strong workforce is more important than senseless regulations. The
California Small Business Association supports me because I created
thousands of jobs, expanded opportunities for veterans and secured
funding for small businesses.

I’m from a law enforcement and military family, value freedom
and understand personal sacrifice. The California Police Chief’s
Association and Crime Victims United have endorsed me due to my
strong support of public safety and fervent opposition toward the
Governor’s early release program for hardened criminals.

We must focus on issues that directly affect the future of our state and
its industries: namely, our dwindling water supply. As your Senator, I
will fight to ensure that California’s water supply is readily available for
those who need it most: families and small businesses that depend
on this critical resource to create jobs and sustain our high standard
of living.

With your support I will continue to use my experience and degree in
Workforce Development and Education to promote a broad array of
conservative priorities - sound fiscal policies, quality schools, safer
communities and protecting the value of every life.

Experience and ethics matter.

MEMBER OF THE STATE ASSEMBLY,

56TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT

EDUARDO GARCIA, Democratic
OCCUPATION:	Mayor / Legislative Director

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

As a lifelong resident of the Coachella Valley, a father, and a public
servant, I want what is best for our families, residents, and local
businesses.

I am running for State Assembly to fight for the issues that matter most
to our residents: strengthening our economy, improving neighborhood
schools, and building healthier, safer communities.

As a four-term Mayor of Coachella and policy director, I have a proven
track record of building coalitions with Republicans and Democrats to
deliver results and positive solutions for our community.

As Mayor, I work with business and labor to launch local job creation
initiatives. Under my watch, Coachella invested over $100 million in
public works projects - infrastructure and transportation, parks &
recreation, and a revitalized downtown. As a result, our city is a better
place to live, work, and raise a family. During the recession, when
other cities across the state made drastic cuts and slashed services,
our residents and tax dollars were protected because of the fiscal
safeguards I helped establish.

I’ve built partnerships between the city and community-based non-
profits to expand access to health care throughout the Coachella
Valley - work that was recognized by President Bill Clinton last year.

I have the experience and proven record as an effective leader
needed to fight for the Coachella Valley in the Legislature. Please join
Congressman Raul Ruiz, firefighters, teachers, police officers, and
the California Democratic Party in supporting my campaign.

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

I am Charles Bennett Jr and I am running for the 56th assembly district
to serve you, the people, as I did for our country as a US Marine for
over 10 years.

I attended public schools until the 11th grade when I attended and

aviation college prior to enlisting in the Marine Corps where I worked
as a military police officer having worked in various aspects of law
enforcement.

Upon coming to Riverside County, I used the Gl bill to attend COD
where I studied business as well as classes in economics.

Currently, I have a small business where I consult on security and
public safety issues for public and private entities, and also serve as
a contributing expert to local broadcast media.

I entered the workforce at 13 delivering newspapers. I have had a
variety jobs; some I did not like but had to do in order to pay bills. I
know what it is like to be broke and live payday to payday.

I am running to serve the people, not politicians, special interests or
agenda’s. I know what it takes to create jobs, keep our communities
and schools safe and I will make veteran’s issues a priority.

I currently live in Indio with my wife and two small children.

I am asking for your vote to represent you in Sacramento.

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE “HH”

This measure was placed on the ballot by a unanimous vote of the City
Council after declaring a Fiscal Emergency.

This measure proposes to impose a tax on the cultivation of marijuana
for medical use and for casual/recreational use in the event such use
is legalized or decriminalized in California. It will be an annual tax of
$25.00 per square foot for the first 3,000 square feet and then $10.00
per square foot for the remaining space utilized in connection with the
cultivation of marijuana for the above uses.

The purpose of this tax is to raise revenue to fund general municipal
services.

The tax will not be charged to any patient or consumer. Payment of the
tax shall solely be the responsibility of the person or entity authorized
to legally cultivate marijuana within the City.

"Space utilized in connection with the cultivation of marijuana" means
any space or ground, floor or other surface area which is used during the
marijuana germination, seedling, vegetative, pre-flowering, flowering
and harvesting phases, including any space used for growing, planting,
seeding, germinating, lighting, warming, cooling, aerating, fertilizing,
watering, irrigating, topping, pinching, cropping, curing or drying
marijuana or any space used for storing related products, supplies or
equipment, no matter where such storage may take place or be located.

The tax will be adjusted annually beginning on July 1, 2015, and July
1 of each succeeding year based on the Consumer Price Index. No
adjustment shall decrease the tax, unless approved by the City Council.

The tax must be remitted to the City biennially, on or before December
31 and June 30 every year.

The City Council may repeal the tax, but it may not increase the amount
of the tax or broaden the scope of the tax, without voter approval.

Failure to pay the tax within 30 days after the due date will be subject
to a 25% penalty. Additional penalties of 10% will be added on the first
day of each calendar month thereafter if the tax remains unpaid - up to
a maximum of 100%.

Nonpayment of the tax shall also constitute a public nuisance and
infraction.

The City will be authorized to examine all necessary records to
ascertain the amount of any tax due during normal business hours, and
such records must be maintained for at least seven (7) years.

Payment of the tax shall not be construed as authorizing operation of
any illegal business or of a legal business in an illegal manner, nor
does payment of the tax imply or authorize that any activity connected
with the cultivation, possession or provision of marijuana is legal
unless otherwise authorized and allowed by the State of California and
permitted by the City.

This tax will take effect commencing upon the effective date of a City
ordinance permitting the cultivation and distribution of marijuana for
medical and/or recreational use within the City of Desert Hot Springs.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of
Measure “HH”. If you desire a copy of the measure,

to you.

Measure “HH” is an annual tax of $25.00 per square foot for the first

3,000	square feet and then $10.00 per square foot thereafter for the
cultivation of marijuana for medical use and casual/recreational use.

The tax will help fund basic City services such as street sweeping;
public parks and building maintenance; public safety; youth, adult and
senior programs; and public infrastructure.

Earlier this year, the City Council took drastic efforts to keep the City
financially solvent and provide basic City services, at the expense of
causing financial distress to many community non-profit organizations
which have traditionally provided valuable services to our seniors,
children, business owners, veterans and residents.

Even after the City Council reduced staff positions by more than
70%; reduced employee salaries by 22% to 35%; reduced employee
benefits and holidays; cut several consulting contracts and reduced
others by 20% - 30%; and, reduced support of local non-profits that
provide services to our residents, the City still had to cut an additional
$1,600,000.00 in Fiscal Year 2013-14. These cuts were necessary to
maintain a minimal “bare bones” budget to continue City operations
through the current fiscal year or risk fiscal insolvency. The City’s need
for additional revenue is immediate and will become ever more pressing
during this fiscal year and next fiscal year.

Your “YES” vote will show your support for protecting the interests,
values, quality of life, and health & wellness of the residents of the City
of Desert Hot Springs.

We ask for your support by voting “YES” on Measure “HH”.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE “HH”

RIDICULOUSLY UNWORKABLE

How will someone prove they paid tax on a particular leaf.... leaf prints?
Disabled marijuana smokers can never be the source of much revenue.
Since they didn’t cause the problem, taxing them won’t fix it (obvious).

President Obama and U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said Federal
Prosecution against medical marijuana patients would ensue if state/
local laws were violated.

Creates a maze of crushing restrictions. A single violation means the
U.S. Justice Department may prosecute. Want to ruin more DHS lives?

Criminals won’t pay, only good law abiding people. Targets people

Triple Taxation -120% + Sales Tax + This Tax

Who is subject to this law? What are its provisions? We don't know.
We’re giving them carte blanche to enact anything they wish.

Section 3.33.070 “The City Manager, or designee, and/or the City
Council by ordinance, may promulgate regulations to implement and
administer the provisions of this chapter.”

Section 3.33.080 “PENALTIES... Postmarks will not be accepted as
adequate proof of timely payment.” Why not?

This tax is not voluntary. It requires sweeping surveillance of everyone.
The costs will far outweigh any revenues. It requires intrusive
inspections of all structures at any time without a warrant. Warrants
are only needed if going to court. There is no recourse with this... none.
It implies the use of drones, and advanced imaging technologies. It
requires a new database of information on every person, unavailable
to the public.

How do they know you’re subject to the provisions until after they have
inspected your premises, “books” and personal papers? It actually
specifies books! Section 3.33.100 “Whenever it is necessary to examine
any books or records, including tax returns, of any entity subject to the
provisions this chapter... the City shall have the power and authority to
examine such necessary books and records...”

Section 3.33.090 says a violation is a “public nuisance”. Subject to a
$1,000 a day fine and possible forfeiture of the property.

They snuck in a “poison pill”, unlimited spending.

Section 3. “APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT ...the appropriations limit for the
City of Desert Hot Springs is increased to the maximum extent over the
maximum period of time allowed under law...”

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE “HH”

Don’t pay attention to the rhetoric. This is an annual tax only on the
cultivation of marijuana for medical and recreational purposes. The
revenue generated will go to the general fund to fund basic City services
such as street sweeping; public parks and building maintenance; public
safety; youth, adult and senior programs; and public infrastructure.

The City will have the authority to conduct audits to examine
bookkeeping records of persons or businesses engaged in marijuana
businesses.

Earlier this year, the City Council took drastic efforts to keep basic
City services at the expense of causing financial distress to many
community non-profit organizations which have traditionally provided
valuable services to our seniors, children, business owners, veterans
and residents.

The City Council reduced staff positions by more than 70%; reduced
employee salaries by 22% to 35%; reduced employee benefits and
holidays; cut several consulting contracts and reduced others by 20%
- 30%; and, reduced support of local non-profits that provide services
to our residents.

The City’s need for additional revenue is immediate and will become
ever more pressing during this fiscal year and next fiscal year.

Your YES vote will show your support for protecting the interests,
values, quality of life, and health & wellness of the residents of the
City of Desert Hot Springs. We ask for your support by voting YES on
Measure “HH”.

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE “II”

This measure was placed on the ballot by a unanimous vote of the City
Council after declaring a Fiscal Emergency.

This measure proposes to impose a tax on any person or entity legally
selling or providing marijuana for medical use and casual/recreational
use if such use is legalized or decriminalized in California. It will be a
monthly tax of 10% of the proceeds from such sales or provision.

The purpose of this tax is to raise revenue to fund general municipal
services.

The tax will not be charged to any patient, caregiver or consumer.
Payment of the tax shall solely be the responsibility of the person or
entity selling or providing the marijuana.

"Proceeds" means gross receipts of any kind, including without
limitation, membership dues; the value of in-kind contributions,
exchanges, bartered goods or services; the value of volunteer work;
reimbursements provided by members regardless of form; cash
payments; and anything else of value obtained by any person or entity
for legally selling or providing marijuana.

The City Council may repeal the tax, but it may not increase the amount
of the tax or broaden the scope of the tax, without voter approval.

Failure to pay the tax within 30 days after the due date will be subject
to a penalty of 25% of the total due. Additional penalties of 10% will
be added on the first day of each calendar month thereafter if the tax
remains unpaid - up to a maximum of 100%.

Nonpayment of the tax shall also constitute a public nuisance and
infraction.

The City will be authorized to examine all necessary records to
ascertain the amount of any tax due during normal business hours, and
such records must be maintained for at least seven (7) years.

Payment of the tax shall not be construed as authorizing operation of
any illegal business or of a legal business in an illegal manner, nor
does payment of the tax imply or authorize that any activity connected
with the cultivation, possession or provision of marijuana is legal
unless otherwise authorized and allowed by the State of California and
permitted by the City.

This tax will take effect commencing upon the effective date of a City
ordinance permitting the cultivation and distribution of marijuana for
medical and/or recreational use within the City of Desert Hot Springs.

Measure “II” is a monthly 10% tax on the proceeds of any person or

The tax will help fund basic City services such as street sweeping;
public parks and building maintenance; public safety; youth, adult and

Earlier this year, the City Council took drastic efforts to keep the City
financially solvent and provide basic City services, at the expense of
causing financial distress to many community non-profit organizations
which have traditionally provided valuable services to our seniors,
children, business owners, veterans and residents.

Even after the City Council reduced staff positions by more than
70%; reduced employee salaries by 22% to 35%; reduced employee
benefits and holidays; cut several consulting contracts and reduced
others by 20% - 30%; and, reduced support of local non-profits that
provide services to our residents, the City still had to cut an additional
$1,600,000.00 in Fiscal Year 2013-14. These cuts were necessary to
maintain a minimal “bare bones” budget to continue City operations
through the current fiscal year or risk fiscal insolvency. The City’s need
for additional revenue is immediate and will become ever more pressing
during this fiscal year and next fiscal year.

It’s not Marijuana vs. Alcohol. It is Medical Marijuana vs. Prescription

Prescription narcotics are highly addictive, cause numerous deaths, by

and make you feel “dopey”. Let the cancer patient decide.

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE “JJ”

This measure was placed on the ballot by a unanimous vote of the City
Council after declaring a Fiscal Emergency.

This measure proposes to increase the combine sales, transaction and
use tax rate in the City of Desert Hot Spring an additional one percent
(1%).

Currently, the combined sales, transactions and use tax rate in Desert
Hot Springs is eight percent (8%), of which the State receives six
and one-half percent (6.5%), the Riverside County Transportation
Commission receives one-half percent (.50%), and the remaining one
percent (1%) is distributed to the City for general purposes.

The sales, transactions and use tax is imposed on retailers for the
selling of tangible personal property at retail and on the storage, use or
other consumption in the City of tangible personal property purchased
from any retailer, subject to certain exclusions and exemptions.

By increasing the City’s sales, transaction and use tax by 1.00%, it
is projected to generate $1.4 million dollars annually for essential City
services.

The proceeds of the City’s share of the combined sales, transaction
and use tax are deposited in the City’s general fund and used for
general governmental purposes, such as City operations, police and
fire services, street sweeping and repair, paramedics, parks and
recreation, emergency response services, capital projects and other
essential services.

Since the revenue of the proposed one percent increase will not be
restricted to fund only certain specified City services, it may be
approved by a simple majority (50% plus one) vote of the electorate.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE “JJ”

Last year the City cut its budget by $3.5 Million and cut another $1.6
Million prior to July 1, 2014 to make ends meet. The City had to reduce
employees by 70%, employee salaries and benefits, and cut public
programs and services.

The proposed 1% sales tax increase measure (8% to 9%) will result in
an economic boost and is estimated to generate $1.4 Million in general
fund revenue. The revenue will be used for various City operations
such as street sweeping; public parks and building maintenance; public
safety; youth, adult and senior programs; and public infrastructure.

If the measure fails, more drastic cuts will be forthcoming to essential
City programs and services.

The City has a population of nearly 28,000 and it continues to grow.
Tourism is a vital industry to Desert Hot Springs as a result of our
natural hot mineral water spas bringing in an estimated $1.2 Million
during Fiscal Year 2013-14. While residents and visitors bring revenue
dollars into the city, they also increase the cost of local services, such
as transportation, parks, streets, public amenities, public safety, and
other essential municipal services. A YES vote on this measure will:

1.	CREATE a thriving, diverse and sustainable economic base.

2.	PROMOTE a balanced, managed and sustainable growth.

3.	FOSTER a strong sense of community vitality and vibrancy.

4.	PRESERVE a strong sense of place, character and heritage.

5.	MAINTAIN the health & wellness of the community.

6.	CONSERVE the quality of life.

Because of the numerous benefits associated with these
communitywide issues, your support of Measure “JJ” will ensure the
City reaches solvency to continue to provide a high level of service to
its residents. Please vote YES on Measure “JJ”.

Reject the Liars - A 1% increase in this 8% tax means you will pay
12.5% more sales taxes only in DHS... will that help?

DHS Taxpayers - Residents, Business & Visitors Didn’t Cause the
Problem. Punishing Them Won't Fix It - Who’s next?

IT WON’T FIX THE PROBLEM! WHY DO IT?

Just transfers a public debt into many private debts. A government “bail-
in’’. Private individuals are less able to get help or make adjustments.
They’re just stuck. Destroys the “safe harbor” people have struggled to
find from the economic storms. People are already in peril.

Where did your money go? “The Vortex Plan”, millions on “facades”- Truth is
stranger than fiction! The whole plan was an attempted facade of success.
But it didn’t work at all. Who knew a city that just went bankrupt,
immediately borrowing $35,835,000, plus over $32 Million interest
would cause problems... me.

Another $50 Million “is set aside” for a golfcart path to Indio. (!!!???)

Our City Council is nonstop drama, breathtaking cliffhangers,
heartpounding terror. Our opportunities disappear as they squabble
about nonsense.

Lacking Vision - Loosing Opportunities - Drifting aimless from crisis to

A Sales Tax Hike on DHS Residents, Businesses and Visitors

Remember, I was the only one who told you the truth.

Just After the Election... CBS Local 2 - Nov 12, 2013
DHS Residents Want Answers

People we spoke with in Desert Hot Springs Tuesday could not believe
the mayor and the entire council were not aware their city was projected
to run out of money by early next year.

“How wouldn’t they know? That’s what they do for a living,” 33-year DHS
resident, Sam Jones, said. “They’re supposed to run the city. You're
telling me that they just don’t know, yet they’re going to go bankrupt.”
“I'd like to know why does City Hall have to steal money from the
people?” Art Shine said. “We’re paying through the nose as is.”

The General Fund = City Council Slush Fund (Dark Pools of Money)
Nearly $300 Million for a new prison in Indio, plenty of money for prison
beds for DHS kids, but nothing else. Twisted priorities, a dead end for
DHS kids.

They claim they have made huge cuts to the budget. Are they lying
again? The fact is if you cut money you were never going to have, that
is not a cut. That is just reality crashing in on you.

One defining characteristic of an actual cut is that you have the money
left over afterward. Only in politics can you pat yourself on the back for
not spending money you were never going to have.

We don’t need to make cuts at all (or raise taxes). Just don’t allocate
spending more than your revenue.

Don’t be fooled by a fiction writer’s political rhetoric. Consider the facts
and VOTE YES ON “JJ”.

FACT: The City of Desert Hot Springs declared a Fiscal Emergency
based on the independent review and findings of an outside auditor.
Our fiscal challenges have been national news, obvious to everyone
but the sole person opposing Measure “JJ”.

FACT: Last year the City cut its budget by $3.5 Million and cut another
$1.6 Million prior to July 1,2014 to make ends meet.

FACT: If Measure “JJ” does not pass we risk losing or undermining
many programs and services including Cabot’s Museum, Chamber
of Commerce, Hoteliers Association, Aquatic Center, public safety,
street sweeping, public parks and building maintenance, youth, adult
and senior programs and public infrastructure. We must take action
to prevent this from happening and protect our residents and local
businesses.

FACT: Measure “JJ” will increase the sales tax 1% from 8% to 9% and
provide an estimated $1.4 Million in general fund revenue to be used
for various City operations. It will create a thriving economic base;
promote a balanced, managed and sustainable growth; preserve a
sense of community; maintain health & wellness of the community; and
conserve the quality of life.

FACT: If Measure “JJ” does not pass it will pose a negative impact
to reaching solvency to continue to provide the level of services that
residents deserve.
