The Top Two Candidates Open Primary Act requires that all candidates for a voter-nominated office be listed on the same ballot.
Previously known as partisan offices, voter-nominated offices are state legislative offices, U.S. congressional offices, and state
constitutional offices.

In both the open primary and general elections, you can vote for any candidate regardless of what party preference you indicated
on your voter registration form. In the primary election, the two candidates receiving the most votes—regardless of party
preference—move on to the general election. If a candidate receives a majority of the vote (50 percent + 1), a general election
still must be held.

California’s open primary system does not apply to candidates running for local offices.

Voter-Nominated Offices

Political parties are not entitled to formally nominate candidates for voter-nominated offices at the primary election. A
candidate nominated for a voter-nominated office at the primary election is the nominee of the people and not the official nominee
of any party at the general election. A candidate for nomination to a voter-nominated office shall have his or her party preference,
or lack of party preference, stated on the ballot, but the party preference designation is selected solely by the candidate and is
shown for the information of the voters only. It does not mean the candidate is nominated or endorsed by the party designated,
or that there is an affiliation between the party and candidate, and no candidate nominated by the voters shall be deemed to be
the officially nominated candidate of any political party. In the county sample ballot booklet, parties may list the candidates for
voter-nominated offices who have received the party’s official endorsement.

Any voter may vote for any candidate for a voter-nominated office, if they meet the other qualifications required to vote
for that office. The top two vote-getters at the primary election move on to the general election for the voter-nominated office even
if both candidates have specified the same party preference designation. No party is entitled to have a candidate with its party
preference designation move on to the general election, unless the candidate is one of the two highest vote-getters at the primary
election.

Nonpartisan State Offices

Political parties are not entitled to nominate candidates for nonpartisan offices at the primary election, and a candidate
at the primary election is not the official nominee of any party for the specific office at the general election. A candidate for
nomination to a nonpartisan office may not designate his or her party preference, or lack of party preference, on the ballot. The
top two vote-getters at the primary election move on to the general election for the nonpartisan office.

New electoral district boundaries are drawn every 10 years in order to equalize district populations. Boundaries for the
congressional, state legislative, and county supervisorial districts are now different. Boundary changes also apply to any city,
school district, or special district that votes by trustee areas or divisions. To see the new district maps, visit the Registrar of
Voters website at www.voteinfo.net.

CANDIDATE STATEMENT FOR
UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE,

36TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT

RAUL RUIZ, Democratic

OCCUPATION:	Congressman / Emergency Physician

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

Washington is broken. There’s too much partisan bickering and too
many career politicians who only care about their own interests.

I am not a career politician, and never will be. I'm an emergency physician
who ran for office to serve people in our communities, just like I have
for my entire adult life.

As a doctor, I'm trained to focus on what matters and to put people first:

I STOOD UP AGAINST EFFORTS TO CUT SOCIAL SECURITY AND
MEDICARE: I promised that I will never vote to cut Medicare benefits,
and I've kept my promise. And I've held workshops and town halls
throughout the area to help prevent fraud against seniors.

I STOOD UP FOR VETERANS: I introduced legislation to speed up
claims for veterans’ benefits, make it easier for veterans to find jobs,
and improve the quality of life for disabled veterans. And my office
helped deliver over $1 million in delayed benefits to local veterans.

I FOUGHT TO END GRIDLOCK: I voted for fiscal responsibility and
a bipartisan budget to protect the economy and prevent another
government shutdown.

I FOUGHT TO MAKE SURE FAMILIES HAVE ACCESS TO
AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. As a physician, I understand the
importance of health care. That’s why I voted to prevent insurance
companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing
conditions, and to help people keep their existing policies under the
new health care law.

We can’t afford more partisan gridlock in Washington. That’s why I
would be honored to have your support.

CANDIDATE STATEMENT FOR
UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE,

36TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT

RAY HAYNES, Republican	AGE:	59

OCCUPATION:	Small	Businessman

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

For fourteen years, I represented Riverside County in the State
Legislature as a member of the State Assembly and the Senate. I
served as the Republican Whip in the Senate, the Assistant Republican
Leader in the Assembly, as Chair of the Senate Constitutional
Amendments Committee, and Vice Chair of the Senate Health and
Human Services Committee. In the year 2000,1 was elected National
Chair of the American Legislative Exchange Council, a national
organization of State Legislators that prepares model legislation from a
free market, less tax, smaller government perspective. As the Senate
Republican Whip, I analyzed legislation for over 4000 bills per year,
and was re-elected to that position 3 times by my Senate Republican
colleagues.

During my service, I received the Legislator of the Year award from
the California Rifle and Pistol Association. I helped pass the “Three
Strikes and You're Out” legislation, which within a year after its passage
helped reduce California’s crime rate by nearly 50%, and I introduced,
and ultimately co-authored the legislation that cut California’ car tax by
67%, which saved the taxpayers of California over $50 billion in the 10
years after its passage.

I will continue to fight in Washington DC for an agenda of small
government and less taxes, just as I did in Sacramento. My Republican
colleagues elected me to leadership because they trusted that my
recommendations on legislation would lead to less taxes and smaller
government. You will be able to trust me as well.

CANDIDATE STATEMENT FOR
UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE,

36TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT

BRIAN NESTANDE, Republican
OCCUPATION:	State	Representative

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

I am running for Congress to help reignite the American Dream and
move our country in the direction of growth and prosperity.

My wife Gina and I have a family and we are working hard to provide
a better future for our children. But Washington is making it harder for
middle class families to get ahead.

Every year Congress keeps spending more money. Our national debt
is now over $17 trillion. And this debt will be handed down to future
generations.

That’s why I’ll sponsor a Balanced Budget Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution - to stop the reckless spending.

I will vote to replace Obamacare with needed healthcare reform
that costs less, and allows patients and doctors to make healthcare
decisions, not Washington bureaucrats.

Let’s focus on protecting and enhancing what Americans really want:

•	Policies that encourage businesses to expand and promote
so we have high quality, full time, good paving jobs.

•	Secure funding for Medicare and Social Security.

•	A strong national defense that keeps us safe, and doesn’t
interfere with individual liberties.

•	To provide teachers and parents with the necessary
resources and tools. Our children deserve the best education
in the world.

I am committed to moving America in the right direction.

I would be honored to have your vote.

STATE SENATOR,

28TH SENATORIAL DISTRICT

GLENN A. MILLER, Republican	AGE: 50

OCCUPATION:	City Councilmember / Businessman

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

As your State Senator I will bring back local control from Sacramento
and its special interests. I am not a Sacramento insider or a career
politician, but an independent leader working for you to get the
resources needed to solve issues at the local level. That is what I have
done as a Councilmember for over 6 years.

My first priority is to create more jobs and work to improve our economy.
As a small business owner, I believe in cutting government “red tape”,
reducing business fees and lessening the burden of over regulation that
impacts both employers and employees.

I will protect Proposition 13 from efforts in Sacramento to change it to
create a $6 billion tax increase and will work to improve our schools by
moving resources back to teachers in the class room.

My endorsements include Mayors and Councilmembers from:
Murrieta, Palm Desert, Palm Springs, Lake Elsinore, Indio, Rancho
Mirage, La Quinta, Cathedral City, Indian Wells, Wildomar, Blythe,
Desert Hot Springs and California Highway Patrolmen, Palm Springs
Police Officers Association, Indio Police Officers Association, CDF
Firefighters and Cathedral City Fire Management Association.

I’m a common sense, fiscally responsible, endorsed local leader that
gets things done. Please vote Glenn Miller.

Thank You.

ANNA NEVENIC, Democratic
OCCUPATION:	Registered	Nurse	/	Author

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

I’m a nurse, educator and a community activist. I value honesty, integrity
and compassion. I believe that

California’s best days are ahead of us if we change the status quo and
public policies that have failed us. As your senator I will stand up to
wealthy special interest and fight for the bold solutions that are going
to bring positive change to our state. Tax cuts for the reach have
bankrupted America. The middle class pays: more for education,
healthcare, broken schools, closed parks and courts. Talented students
cannot afford tuition, threatening our future. I’m solution oriented and I
pledge to protect my special interest; children, seniors and families in
my district. I have detailed plans for creation of well-paid jobs, cleaning
up our environment, and providing job training for displaced workers
and students. Creation of sustainable, well-paying jobs is possible.
Offer tax incentives to foster innovation, and attract investments in
local industry. There is no better place for clean-tech industries than
in our district. We must provide first-rate education and tools to drive
our economy forward. Support policies that empower teachers, not
politicians and bureaucrats. I believe in equal rights and in women
right to choose. We must educate our youth; prevent crime, drug use,
poverty and teen pregnancy. My campaign is people driven. Stand up
with me! Together we will bring change that we need. Please share our
fight with your friends.

CANDIDATE STATEMENT FOR
STATE SENATOR,

28TH SENATORIAL DISTRICT

BONNIE GARCIA, Republican
OCCUPATION:	Small	Business	Woman

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

California is broken - Taxes are high, criminals are being released early,
property owners are losing their rights and our court system continues
to allow environmental extremists to stop development that push jobs
out of state.

During my six years as your Assemblywoman, I didn’t support a single
tax increase or reckless spending and voted to adopt a rainy day fund.
My stance earned me the support of every Republican State Senator
and Four Riverside County Supervisors.

I'm from a law enforcement and Military family, value freedom and
understand personal sacrifices. The Gun Owners of California
endorsed me because I fought to protect your 2nd Amendment rights
and will never jeopardize your right to protect your family.

I’m a strong advocate of Public Safety and opposed the Governor’s
plan to allow hardened criminals to leave prison early. That's why I
earned the support of The California Police Chiefs' Association and
Crime Victims United.

The California Small Business Association support me because I
created thousands of jobs, expanded opportunities for veterans and
secured funding for small businesses. I understand a strong workforce
is more important than senseless regulations.

With your support I will continue to use my experience and degree in
Workforce Development and Education to promote a broad array of
conservative priorities - sound fiscal policies, quality schools, safer
communities and protecting the value of every life.

Experience and ethics matter.

I would be honored to have your vote.

JEFF STONE, Republican	AGE:	58

OCCUPATION:	Riverside County Supervisor / Small Business

Owner

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

As a Riverside County Supervisor and longtime small business
owner, I’m proud to be running for the Senate with the support of local
taxpayers, seniors and small business owners.

I’m also honored to be the choice of Law Enforcement leaders, including
Riverside County Sheriff Stan Sniff. District Attorney Paul Zellerbach
and the Riverside Sheriffs Association.

Over 3,200 law enforcement officers and investigators in Riverside
County endorse me because they know I will OPPOSE EARLY
RELEASE of dangerous prisoners and work to keep our neighborhoods,
schools and homes safe.

I signed the NO NEW TAXES pledge because taxpayers already pay
too much for a broken, dysfunctional state government. As a local
official, I successfully lowered taxes without cutting vital services. I’ll
work to do the same in Sacramento.

My priorities are: JOB CREATION and Improving the Business
Climate; No New Taxes, Balance the Budget, Stop Early Release of
Prison Inmates. I support the 2nd Amendment and believe in limited
government.

I’m supported by Riverside County Supervisor Kevin Jeffries, who said:
“Jeff Stone is a true citizen-politician who will bring strong conservative
values to the State Senate.”

Special interests in Sacramento are spending massive sums of money
to influence your vote. Ask yourself: do you want a Senator who will
be a voice for the special interests; or one who will be a voice for you?

I’d be honored to receive your vote and represent you in the State
Senate. Please visit www.JeffStone2014.com to read more. Thank you.

CANDIDATE STATEMENT FOR
MEMBER OF THE STATE ASSEMBLY,

56TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT

EDUARDO GARCIA, Democratic
OCCUPATION:	Mayor,	City	of Coachella

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

As a lifelong resident of the Coachella Valley, a father, and a public
servant, I want what is best for our families, residents, and local
businesses.

I’m running for State Assembly to fight for the issues that matter most
to our residents: strengthening our economy, improving neighborhood
schools, and building healthier, safer communities.

As a four-term Mayor of Coachella and policy director for State
Senator Ben Hueso, I have a track record of building coalitions that
get results, and working with elected leaders from both parties to find
positive solutions.

As Mayor, I worked with business and labor to spearhead local jobs
initiatives. Under my watch, Coachella invested over $100 million in
public works projects — infrastructure and transportation, parks &
recreation, and a revitalized downtown. As a result, our city is a better
place to live, work, and raise a family. During the recession, when
other cities around the state made drastic cuts and slashed services,
our residents and tax dollars were protected because of the fiscal
safeguards I helped establish.

I’ve built partnerships between the city and community-based
nonprofits to expand access to health care throughout the Coachella
Valley — this work was recognized by President Bill Clinton last year.

I have the experience and expertise to be a strong advocate for
the Coachella Valley in the Legislature. Please join Congressman
Raul Ruiz, Assemblymember Manuel Perez, as well as firefighters,
police, nurses, and the California Democratic Party in supporting my
campaign.

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

I am Charles Bennett Jr and I am running for the 56th assembly district
to serve you, the people, as I did for our country as a US Marine for
over 10 years.

I attended public schools until the 11th grade when I attended and
graduated from a military school. Upon graduating, I attended an
aviation college prior to enlisting in the Marine Corps where I worked
as a military police officer having worked in various aspects of law
enforcement.

Upon coming to Riverside County, I used the Gl bill to attend COD
where I studied business as well as classes in economics.

Currently, I have a small business where I consult on security and
public safety issues for public and private entities as well as contribute
to these issues on local news channels.

variety jobs; some I did not like but had to do in order to pay bills. I
know what it is like to be broke and live payday to payday.

I am running to serve the people, not politicians, special interests or
agenda’s. I know what it takes to create job, keep our communities
and schools safe and I will make veteran’s issues a priority.

LEONARD J. CRAVENS	AGE: 55

OCCUPATION:	Attorney	at	Law

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

My name is Leonard Cravens. I am running for Superior Court Judge,
Seat 3, Riverside County. I have college degrees in Computer Science
and Information Systems, as well as my Law Degree. I worked many
years as a computer programmer & systems analyst. Because of that
work, I am uniquely qualified to implement changes in procedures at
the court that respect YOU and your TIME.

Customer Service at Riverside Superior Court needs to respect YOU
and your TIME. Cases (including detailed results of hearings) such
as Criminal, Traffic, and Civil should be available to be viewed on the
court’s website without paying a fee. Papers should be able to be filed
at any courthouse, not just the courthouse where the case was filed.
You should be able to “Walk In” to any courthouse to see a judicial
officer about your traffic or misdemeanor warrant case that same
day! I propose that if you arrive at any courthouse by 3:00PM, you are
guaranteed to see a judicial officer that same day to resolve your traffic
ticket or misdemeanor warrant.

If you want the Riverside Superior Court to respect YOU and your

MARK A. COPE	AGE: 55

OCCUPATION:	Superior Court Judge

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

I’ve been honored to serve the people of Riverside County as a judge
since 1995. Riverside County deserves a judge with experience,
integrity, and a commitment to justice.

EXPERIENCE. Since leaving a career as a prosecutor over two
decades ago, I have presided over thousands of hearings in cases of
all types - criminal, family, civil, traffic, small claims, juvenile and others.
My experience even includes teaching other judges.

INTEGRITY. Judges are not elected to make law. My record shows my
firm commitment to the rule that a judge cannot allow outside influences
to affect decisions, nor let personal views overrule the will of the people.

COMMITTED TO JUSTICE. As Presiding Judge, I’ve worked hard to
ensure access to justice for all. Riverside County has not had its fair
share of judges and funding for court services. Together with others,
I have fought for change, and we are winning. Riverside County now
more fairly receives resources to open doors to courthouses that have
been closed, and let people who need services have their day in court.

Please join every current Riverside County judge, numerous Presiding
Judges from other courts, retired judges, law enforcement officials, and
your friends and neighbors. Vote to re-elect Judge Mark Cope.

Retired Highway Patrol Commander
EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

I have served our community as highway patrol commander, school
board member, legislator and county supervisor.

I am now putting that experience to work, leading efforts to grow our

I brought the Coachella Valley nearly a half-billion dollars in upcoming
public safety and infrastructure investments which will make us safer,
create hundreds of construction jobs and generate 400 new, permanent
positions.

By promoting tourism, fast-tracking permits and providing tax credits to
job creating employers, I helped add even more jobs.

I ensured that all $50 million from the Sentinel Power Plant was returned
to the valley, further benefiting our local economy.

Health care access will improve locally as a result of the new medical
school, physician training programs and new medical clinics which I
helped bring to the valley.

My 31 years in law enforcement taught me how to keep people safe.
That’s why I helped enact a law to protect students from sex offenders,
took action to stop the early release of dangerous prisoners and
supported construction of two new sheriff’s stations.

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE “B”

In response to the fiscal emergency declared and reaffirmed by the
City Council of Cathedral City on February 24, 2010 and May 22, 2013
respectively, the City’s voters are being asked to vote on Measure “B”,
which, if approved, would amend an ordinance so that the City could
continue imposing a one-percent (1%) transactions and use tax on all
retailers doing business in the City. Pursuant to Assembly Bill 354, this
Measure is being placed on the ballot by the City of Cathedral City’s
governing body, the City Council.

The proposed continuation is a general tax, the proceeds of which
would be deposited in the City’s general fund to be used for general
governmental purposes, such as City operations, police and fire
services, street sweeping and repair, paramedics, parks and recreation,
emergency response services, capital projects and other essential
services.

If approved, the City estimates Measure “B” will generate $4 million
dollars annually for essential City services. The proposed continuation
of this tax would be imposed on retailers for the selling of tangible
personal property at retail and on the storage, use or other consumption
in the City of tangible personal property purchased from any retailer,
subject to certain exclusions and exemptions which are detailed in the
proposed ordinance implementing the tax.

Currently, the combined sales and transactions and use tax rate is
9.00%. Of this 9.00%, the State receives 6.50%, the Riverside County
Transportation Commission receives .50%, and the remaining 2.00%
is distributed to the City for general purposes. If the voters approve
the proposed measure, the continued total tax rate for most purchases
in the City would remain at 9.00%. The proposed measure is a
continuation of an existing tax not a new tax and would be collected in
the same manner and at the same time as such taxes are paid.

The proposed measure provides for independent review of the revenues
generated by the tax by the Citizens' Financial Advisory Committee, and
requires annual financial audits performed by a qualified, independent
third party, the results of which would be available for public review.

The proposed measure is a continuation of an existing general tax,
requiring a majority vote (approval by more than fifty percent (50%) of
City voters voting in the election) for passage.

A “Yes” vote means the voter is in favor of Measure “B” authorizing the
City to continue to collect a 1% transactions and use tax.

A “No” vote means the voter is not in favor of Measure “B” and means
the current 1% Transactions and Use Tax will expire September 30,2015.

City Attorney

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure“B”.
If you desire a copy of the ordinance implementing Measure
“B”, please call the Cathedral City City Clerk’s Office at
760-770-0322 and a copy will be mailed at no cost to you.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE “B”

Vote YES on “B" - Protect Cathedral City’s essential community and
public safety services, without raising taxes!

YES on "B” does not create a new tax. It simply continues existing
funding previously passed by Cathedral City voters-with NO increase
in taxes—to maintain vital city services we rely on.

Cathedral City is one of the few cities in the region with its own local
police and fire departments. YES on “B” maintains our locally-controlled
Cathedral City police and fire departments and other vital programs so
the needs of residents and local businesses are addressed effectively
by people who actually live and work in our community.

YES on “B” maintains effective 9-1-1 response

YES on "B" ensures police officers and firefighters have essential

equipment

YES on “B” retains 9-1-1 dispatch operators, police officers and
firefighters

YES on “B” maintains 9-1-1 communications equipment
YES on “B” legally requires that all funds be spent on OUR
services -Sacramento can’t touch it!

Over the past five years, Sacramento politicians have taken about $20
million from Cathedral City, and will continue to do so every year for
the foreseeable future. YES on “B” ensures Cathedral City continues
to have a guaranteed source of local funding that cannot be taken
by Sacramento and requires that our tax dollars be spent locally for
Cathedral City residents without raising taxes.

YES on “B” includes tough fiscal accountability provisions to continue to
preventwaste, fraud and abuse of public funds. An Independent Citizens
Finance Advisory Committee will review all spending. Residents will
have access to public expenditure reports, and annual independent
audits assure City officials use voter-approved tax dollars as promised.

Join police officers, firefighters, local business owners, and community
leaders in voting YES on “B”to protect and maintain Cathedral City’s vital
services without raising taxes. For offical information about Measure “B”,

RV 038-024

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE “D”

Water Code section 30730 allows a water district to submit to the voters
the question of how the water district’s board of directors is elected.
CVWD’s Board of Directors placed Measure "D" on this year’s ballot.

Currently the Coachella Valley Water District (CVWD) is divided into five
directorial divisions, and though each director must live in a different
directorial division, each director is elected by all CVWD voters.

A “Yes” vote on Measure “D” will mean that only the voters of the
directorial division where the candidate lives will be able to vote for that
candidate. Candidates will not be able to receive votes from people in
directorial divisions that they do not directly represent.

A “No” vote on Measure “D” will mean that any voter may vote for
any candidate to CVWD’s board of directors. Candidates will be able
to receive votes from people in directorial divisions that they do not
directly represent.

Measure “D” will be approved if a majority of the voters vote “Yes.”

If Measure “D” passes in the June Statewide Primary Election it will
become effective starting in the November 2014 General Election.
