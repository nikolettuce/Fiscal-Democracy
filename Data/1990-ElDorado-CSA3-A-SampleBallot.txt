IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL
COUNTY SERVICE AREA NO, 3
ADVISORY MEASURE A

Elections Code Section 5353 allows the holding of an advisory election for the
purpose of allowing voters to voice their opinion on a ballot proposal. The
results of the election are not binding upon the legislative body holding the
election.

The Board of Supervisors, acting as the governing board of County Service
Area Number 3, has submitted to the voters of CSA #3 a ballot proposal on
an advisory basis on the issue of whether the per parcel fee imposed for
ambulance services should be increased from $4.60 per parcel to $9.96 per
parcel to fund enhanced ambulance services in the South Lake Tahoe Basin.

A “YES" vote indicates approval of the proposal to increase the per parcel fee
for ambulance services by $5.36.

A “NO” vote indicates disapproval of the proposal to increase the per parcel
fee for ambulance services by $5.36.

Neither a “YES” nor a “NO” vote will result in an increase in the per parcel
fee for ambulance services. The results of this advisory election are not
controlling in any way upon the Board of Supervisors, acting as the governing
body of CSA #3.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE A

Currently, the South Lake Tahoe area has one full-time advanced life support
ambulance available to respond to medical emergencies. The service area
extends from Stateline to Twin Bridges and from beyond Luther Pass, at the
Alpine County line, to D. L. Bliss State Park beyond Emerald Bay. In
emergency situations, a rapid response is critical in order to reduce disability
and save lives. By increasing the availability of medical personnel and
transportation, medical experts believe that health can be better protected and
additional lives can be saved. The addition of a strategically placed part-time
ambulance will serve to augment the area's emergency medical services. A
“yes” vote on this advisory measure will indicate your support for increasing
the available resources for pre-hospital medical services in the South Lake
Tahoe area.
