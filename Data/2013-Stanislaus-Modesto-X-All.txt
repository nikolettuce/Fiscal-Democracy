CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE

The City Council has placed before the voters the question whether to approve an
ordinance enacting a temporary transactions and use tax within the City of Modesto.
The tax rate would be one percent (1.0%) of the retail sales price, or one cent for an
item that costs one dollar. The tax would remain in effect for six years. A full copy of
the ordinance text is printed in these ballot materials.

Currently, the tax on retail sales in Modesto is 7.625% of the purchase price. The City
receives 0.75% of that total amount. The remainder goes to the State (6.5%),
Stanislaus County Local Transportation Fund (0.25%), and Stanislaus County Libraries
(0.125%). Retailers collect the tax at the time of sale and remit the funds to the State
Board of Equalization, which administers the tax and sends the City its share.

This measure would authorize a 1.0% transactions and use tax, which would increase
the total sales tax rate to 8.625%. Of that total amount, 1.75% would be deposited in
the City’s general fund and be available to support the full range of municipal services.
Because this measure does not legally restrict the use of tax revenue to any specific
purposes, it is classified as a “general tax,” not a “special tax.”

The tax would automatically terminate six years after it becomes operative, unless
extended by the voters. In addition, the tax would be reduced to one-half percent
(0.50%) in the event that a countywide transactions and use tax to fund roads were
enacted.

This measure requires the City Council to appoint an eleven-person citizen oversight
committee to review and oversee expenditures of the revenue, to review the portion of
the audit prepared by the City’s independent auditor that relates to the tax, and to
prepare a public report on the expenditure of funds from the tax.

A “Yes” vote is a vote in favor of the tax. A “No” vote is a vote against the tax. This
measure would be approved if it receives a simple majority of “Yes” votes.

§§ 15000 et seq., “CEQA Guidelines”). The transactions and use tax to be submitted to
the voters is a general tax that can be used for any legitimate governmental purpose; it is
not a commitment to any particular action. As such, under CEQA Guidelines section
15378(b)(4), the tax is not a project within the meaning of CEQA because it creates a
government funding mechanism that does not involve any commitment to any specific
project that may result in a potentially significant physical impact on the environment. If
revenue from the tax were used for a purpose that would have either such effect, the city
would undertake the required CEQA review for that particular project. Therefore, under
CEQA Guidelines section 15060 review under CEQA is not required
