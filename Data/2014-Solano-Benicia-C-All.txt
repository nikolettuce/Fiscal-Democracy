ADOPTION OF RESOLUTION APPROVING A TWO-YEAR
EXPENDITURE PLAN FROM PROCEEDS OF MEASURE C

RECOMMENDATION:

Adopt the resolution establishing a two-year expenditure plan from proceeds of
Measure C.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:

On July 28th the City Council adopted a resolution to place on the November
ballot a revenue measure to raise the local transaction and use sales tax by one
cent. If the measure is successful it would go into effect on April 1, 2015 and is
projected to generate approximately $3.7 million annually. As a general
purpose tax, the City Council would allocate the proceeds of the tax during the
City's bi-annual budget adoption process. The purpose of the proposed
resolution is to establish an expenditure plan for the City Council to consider
during the FY 2015-17 budget adoption. The purpose of approving an
expenditure plan for Measure C is to articulate the City Council’s commitment
to address the citizen’s priority service areas as identified in the community
survey that include maintaining existing services and investing in projects that
improve public safety, parks and roads.

BUDGET INFORMATION:

The proposed, locally-enacted sales tax measure of one cent is projected to
generate approximately $3.7 million in revenue to support local needs that
cannot be taken away by the State.

STRATEGIC PLAN:

Relevant Strategic Plan Goals and Strategies:

• Strategy Issue #3: Strengthening Economic and Fiscal Conditions
o Strategy #4: Manage City finances prudently

BACKGROUND:

Over the past few months City staff has presented information on the City’s 10-
year general fund forecast and most recently a community survey where

residents noted their high satisfaction with the City and a strong willingness to
support a one-cent sales tax increase. The overarching message in those studies
was that despite all the actions the City has already taken (employee
reductions and maximizing City revenue from City owned property), the City’s
future revenue will be outpaced by expenditures.

In order to address these challenges, following adoption of the 2013-15 budget,
the Council directed staff to develop a budget stabilization plan. In the
subsequent months, staff has been working on initiating a Sustainable
Community Services Strategy (SCSS), which will help prepare the organization to
take the necessary steps to create a more fiscally sustainable City with the
necessary resources to provide services most valued by the community.

In June of this year, as part of the SCSS process, the City commissioned a
customer satisfaction survey that asked residents what their priorities were. A
random sample of 400 respondents gave the City very high job and customer
satisfaction ratings for the quality of life services it provides, and more than two-
thirds of respondents indicated their strong feelings about protecting Benicia's
status as a full-service city, including the small town quality of life services the
community expects, such as improving public safety and city streets,
maintaining parks, trimming trees, supporting the historic downtown and
community events, attracting new businesses, and creating jobs.

Furthermore, constituents expressed concern about the fact that many of our
streets have cracked or buckled sidewalks, or no sidewalks at all, potholes and
other challenging driving conditions. Additional funding is needed to fix these
road conditions and maintain 94 miles of city streets and roads so motorists,
pedestrians, buses, cyclists and police and fire safety vehicles are sound.
Providing funding to maintain the City’s 31 local parks was also identified as a
priority by 70% of respondents.

Based on the results of the survey, staff recommended and the City Council
approved the consideration of a one-cent sales tax measure on the November
ballot. If approved, the proceeds would be used to maintain those services that
help to shape and create Benicia's quality of life. Specifically the ballot
measure. Measure C, reads as follows:

To maintain Benicia’s status as a full-service city, improve /maintain
Police patrols, fire/9-i-l response times; road conditions; pothole
repair; clean water; storm drains to protect the Carquinez Strait;
business attraction/job creation; park maintenance; other city
services, shall the City of Benicia enact a one cent sales tax with
authority to incur bonded indebtedness to accelerate infrastructure
projects, requiring independent audits. Citizens' Oversight, all

revenue for Benicia, none for Sacramento?

To demonstrate the City Council's commitment to address the communities
priorities set forth in the ballot language, staff recommends establishing an initial
two-year expenditure plan for the proceeds of Measure C. Based on the findings
of the 10-year Fiscal Projection, staff projects that of the estimated $3.7 million to
be generated by the sales tax each year a minimum of $1.7 is needed for the
City to be able to maintain existing service levels. In order to address the other
priorities identified by the citizens in the Community Survey, staff is
recommending the remaining $2 million be invested in unmet capital projects
and infrastructure needs.

The following recommended project list is a result of taking top priorities
identified in the Community Survey, (Public Safety, Parks and Roads), and
juxtaposing them with the City’s existing capital improvement projects lists from
fhe various City departments. Utilizing an estimated $2 million annual allocation
from Measure C, 12 projects/needs were identified as listed below. The following
are the project item, its estimated cost and recommend year of initiation:

Year 1: FY 2015/2016

Industrial Park Road Project: Patch and asphalt overlay on Industrial Way from Teal to Lake Herman Road	$1,000,000

While the intent of the proposed resolution is to provide voters a measure of
assurance as to the appropriation of the proceeds from the first two years of the
sales tax, the actual adoption and allocation of said funds would officially occur
when the City Council adopts the next two-year budget in June of 2015. If the
City Council approves the proposed resolution, the recommended items could
be delineated and described in information material sent to the public prior to
the November election.

It is also important to acknowledge that if the sales tax measure is not successful
the recommend projects would be delayed, possibly indefinitely. Additionally,
the City Council would need to.address the pending $1.5 - $1.7 million deficit,
likely resulting in service cuts.

CITY ATTORNEY'S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE C

Measure C asks the voters to approve a one cent sales tax. The City
Council unanimously voted to place this measure before the voters.
Measure C is a general tax that requires a majority of the voters to
approve it.

State law authorizes the City to levy a local transactions and use tax,
more commonly known as a sales tax on retail sales. Currently, the tax
on retail sales in Benicia is 7.625% of the purchase price. 6.5% goes to
the State and the County and City share the remaining 1.125%. Retailers
collect the tax at the time of sale and remit the funds to the State Board
of Equalization, which administers the tax and sends the City its full
measure. This measure would authorize a 1.0% increase which would
bring the rate to 8.625% which is the same as Vallejo and Fairfield’s. The
1.0% would go only to the City and not to the State or County.

As a general tax, the funds would go to the City’s general fund and are
protected from the State. Funds could be used for legal governmental
purposes. As a full service City, these services could include maintaining
or improving police and fire service and response times, roads and storm
drains, business attraction and job creation, library, recreation and parks
services.

The measure appoints the Finance Committee to provide the citizens’
oversight of the tax. The Committee would make annual reports to the
City Council about how the funds from the tax are being used to address
the Council’s stated priorities. An annual audit by an independent auditor
is also required.

This tax only applies to retail sales. Consistent with state law, the tax
would not apply to prescription medications and food purchased as
groceries. If approved, it would increase the sales tax by a penny per
dollar of sales subject to the tax.

Measure C allows for a majority of the voters or for City Council by a 4/5
vote to repeal the tax.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE C

Concerned about Benicia’s Streets, Parks and Public Safety? Vote
YES on C!

Benicia’s quality of life is something to be proud of but is at risk. State
takeaways of taxes do not allow our quality of life to be sustained without
further action. YES on C provides locally controlled resources to fix
neighborhood streets/roads and maintain other services you rely on -
and Sacramento can’t touch it!

The City Council has already reduced spending and ongoing employee
costs to maintain Benicia’s status as a full-service city with its own
city-run police, fire, park and water services. This one cent sales tax
will stay in Benicia and allow us to keep providing services and make
improvements where needed.

YES on C maintains Benicia's financial viability as a full-service city and
protects our small-town quality of life.

YES on C maintains and improves our public safety and city streets,
parks, historic downtown, community events, business attraction and job
creation.

Benicia maintains 94 miles of streets and roads! YES on C will fix
cracked, buckled sidewalks, potholes and other unsafe driving conditions
so motorists, pedestrians, buses, cyclists and police/fire safety vehicles
are safe—before repairs become even more expensive.

YES on C protects priorities the community has identified:

•	911 emergency response times, neighborhood police patrols, crime
prevention services

•	Programs for local youth

•	Proper maintenance of Benicia’s 31 local parks as safe places for
children and families

YES on C is transparent and fiscally accountable! Measure C requires
a Citizens Oversight Committee and annual independent audits. Out-of-
town shoppers pay their fair share. Measure C is not applied to food
purchased as groceries or prescription medications. We’ll know where
the money goes- not a dime can be taken for Sacramento’s agenda.

Please join us and other Benicia leaders in voting YES on C.
