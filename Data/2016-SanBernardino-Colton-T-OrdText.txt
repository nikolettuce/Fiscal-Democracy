exercises or is entitled to occupancy for a period of thirty consecutive calendar
days or less shall be deemed to be a transient, regardless of whether the
reservation and payment or payment for occupancy is made directly by the
individual exercising or entitled to occupancy or another person or entity. The
intent is to tax the individual occupying or having the entitlement to occupy
the hotel room.

and uninterrupted period of longer than 30 calendar days, he or she shall be
deemed a transient and subject to the tax for only the first 30 calendar days
of occupancy and shall cease being a transient and the tax shall not apply on
the 31st calendar day of occupancy and following. However, any break or
interruption in occupancy shall start a new 30 day period subject to the tax.

D.	In the case of a block reservation, a person’s employee or agent shall be
deemed a transient if that employee or agent exercises or is entitled to
occupancy of a room for a period of 30 consecutive calendar days or less,
regardless of the duration of any block reservation agreement By way of
example, if a corporation enters into a one-year block reservation agreement
with an operator and one of the corporation’s employees occupies a room for
30 calendar days, the employee shall be deemed a transient whose occupancy
is subject to the tax, notwithstanding the fact that the block reservation
agreement has a duration longer than 30 calendar days. ”
