<impartial> IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE U

PREPARED BY COUNTY COUNSEL

By ordinance, the County of Sacramento imposes a tax on temporary lodging within the
unincorporated area. Operators of hotels, motels and similar establishments within the
unincorporated area collect the tax from patrons of lodging accommodations, and remit
the collections to the County. The tax receipts are deposited in the Countyâ€™s general fund
and may be expended by the Board of Supervisors for any lawful purpose. The current
amount of the tax is ten percent of the rent charged.

This measure is an ordinance enacted by the Board of Supervisors which would Increase
the tax by one percent, from ten to eleven percent of the rent charged. The one percent
increase would also be subject to expenditure for any lawful purpose. By statute, such a tax increase cannot become effective unless approved by the electorate.

This measure will pass if it is approved by a majority of the voters in the entire County. <impartialend>
