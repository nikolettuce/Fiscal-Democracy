IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
CITY OF STANTON

The City Attorney has prepared the following title and summary of the chief purpose and points of the proposed measure:

The proposed Measure, if passed by the voters, would do the following:

•	Repeal the existing Utility Users Tax;

•	Repeal the existing Protective Services Tax;

•	Obligate the City Council to dissolve the existing Landscaping and Lighting District, thereby terminating the property assessment;

•	Obligate the City Council to abandon the existing Street Lighting District, thereby terminating the property assessment; and

•	Enact a Public Safety Services Fee to be levied and assessed on each parcel of property in the City of Stanton.

The Fee would be charged on a per parcel basis at the rate of $16.88 per month for each residential unit {single family dwelling, apartment,
second unit, condominium or mobile home site). For each improved commercial or industrial parcel the rate would be $211.00 per month per acre.
For each vacant parcel the fee would be $52.75 per month per acre.

The revenues raised by the Public Safety Services Fee would be placed in a special fund and used only for the puiposes of obtaining, furnishing,
operating, and maintaining police service and protection, fire service and protection, emergency medical service, and for paying the salaries and
benefits to police, fire and emergency medical service personnel.

The Measure would provide that the rate of the fee be automatically adjusted each year by the percentage increase or decrease of the Consumer
Price Index.

The Measure would prohibit the City Council from raising the fee above the maximum rate approved by the voters; however, it allows the City
Council to reduce the rate of the fee in any fiscal year.

If the Measure is adopted and then all or any part of it is held to be unconstitutional, and such holding materially affects the legal enforceability
and levy of the Public Safety Services Fee, the Utility Users Tax will automatically be reinstated.

If the Measure is not passed by the voters, the City's Utility Users Tax, Protective Services Tax, Landscaping and Lighting Assessment, and
Street Lighting Assessment would continue to be levied and collected for the benefit of the City of Stanton to the extent permitted by law.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Ordinance or Measure B. If you desire a copy of the ordinance or measure, please call the City
Clerk's office at (714) 379-9222, extension 240, and a copy will be mailed at no cost to you.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE B

A YES vote on Measure B eliminates Stanton’s Utility Tax of 1.3 million
dollars, the 1986 Protective Service Tax of 328,500 dollars, and Lighting
Districts Assessment Taxes of 589,000 dollars. This brings the total tax
reduction to over 2.2 million dollars.

A YES vote on Measure B insures that every dollar raised by Measure
B can only be used for police service and protection, and fire service
and protection, this includes emergency medical services.

A YES vote on Measure B creates an equity citywide in paying
Stanton's protective service costs. Each residential unit will pay the
same $16.88 a month (.55 cents per day). Presently residents are
paying unequal dollar amounts for the same police and fire services.

A YES vote on Measure B funds 2.9 million dollars of the 7 million
dollars annually needed for the high level of police and fire services in
Stanton, which have reduced crime over 30% in the last two years and
have provided excellent emergency service by the Orange County Fire
Authority.

A YES vote on Measure B provides funding to pay for annual increased
costs in police and fire services, which includes police and firefighter’s
salaries.

A YES vote on Measure B helps the Stanton business community by
eliminating the burden of the Utility Users Tax as a cost of doing
business.

A Yes vote on Measure B follows the mandates of Proposition 62 and
Proposition 218 by giving you, the Stanton voter, the ability to control
how your tax dollars are being spent.

ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE B	REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE B
Don’t give our Politicians a loophole. The voters of Stanton overwhelm- ingly approved the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association sponsored Proposition 218 just over six months ago, and it is already under attack. If Measure B passes, every homeowner, mobile home resident, and property owner would be taxed a minimum of $202,56 every year. And if that isn’t enough, they have also built-in a provision which would allow for a yearly increase in the tax. We must Vote No on Measure B.  Don't be fooled by our Politicians, Vote NO on Measure B! Measure B will raise our Protective Services Tax from $24 a year for every Apart- ment unit, Single-Family Homeowner, and Mobile Home resident to $202.56 every year.  Vote NO on Measure B! Measure B will eliminate our utility tax and some small fees for lighting and landscaping, but what for — an increase of $178.56 per year. At that rate our utility bills would need to be in the range of $3,000.00 to $3,500.00 per year.  That facts on this tax are clear. Don’t be scared into believing the Politicians that our Police protection will be taken away. They won’t! Support the intention of Proposition 13 and Proposition 218. Vote NO on Measure B.	A YES vote on Measure B supports the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association belief that the voters of Stanton should control how their tax dollars are being spent. This is why our elected officials closed all loopholes by putting Measure B on the ballot.  What the opponents of Measure B don’t bother to tell you MTHE WHOLE TRUTH”  The present $24 a year protective service tax raises only $328,500 a year.  Measure B will raise 2.9 million dollars a year and will cost each residential unit $202.56 per year.  A majority of property owners in Stanton pay more than the proposed $202.56 per year in taxes and fees to pay for police and fire services.  It cost the City of Stanton 7 million dollars a year for police and fire services, while the total tax revenue is only 6.9 million dollars a year.  The utility tax, lighting and landscaping fees, and the 1986 protective seivice tax are not small. They actually raise 2.2 million tax dollars a year which will be repealed by A YES vote on Measure B.  The consumer price index provision of Measure B controls the
s/Rocio Dominguez, Resident	increased costs of the protective service fees annually by setting a limit on fees charged.  Police and Fire Services will be cut if Measure B fails on the ballot, because 75% of Stanton's general fund budget is spent on protective services.  PROTECT YOUR LIFE AND PROPERTY VOTE "YES" ON MEASURE B
