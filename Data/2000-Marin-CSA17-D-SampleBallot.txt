IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL
MEASURE D

If this Measure is approved by a two-thirds vote, the special tax
levied annually upon living units within County Service Area No. 17
will be increased from $195 per year to an amount not to exceed
$260 per year commencing with fiscal year 2001-2002.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE D

In November 1985,1990 and 1993, the voters of Kent Woodlands
overwhelming approved a special assessment for extra Sheriff’s
patrol services in Kent Woodlands. A “YES” vote on Measure D will
ensure that all Kent Woodlands households continue to receive the
protection and benefits of this special Sheriff's patrol. The approval of
two-thirds of those voting is required to pass this measure.

Measure D both authorizes the continuation of the special Sheriff
patrol assessment and increases the maximum assessment amount
that can be charged from $195 to up to $260. The annual household
assessment is calculated by dividing the costs of the special Sheriffs
patrol by the number of households. In Fiscal Year 2001-2002, this
tax will be $206.

In order to account for future cost increases, we are
recommending that the maximum assessment amount be increased
from $195 to up to $260 per household. Remember that this is only a
maximum amount to account for any possible increase in costs over
the next four years. Under the rules of Proposition 4, the community
must vote on this tax every four years.

Measure D will fund continuation of the current service in Kent
Woodlands up to and including fiscal year 2005-2006. If this measure
does not pass, the Sheriff would no longer be able to continue to
provide this special patrol service at the current level.

We very strongly urge a “YES” vote.
