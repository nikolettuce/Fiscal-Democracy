Impartial Analysis of Measure “T”
Christian Bettenhausen, City Attorney

If approved by a majority of voters, this measure would allow a four percent (4%) increase in
California City’s Transient Occupancy Tax. Currently the City’s Transient Occupancy Tax is six
percent (6%) of the rate charged by the hotel or motel. The measure, which was placed on the
ballot by the City Council, proposes a 4% increase in the City’s existing Transient Occupancy
Tax. If approved by the voters, the tax rate would increase to ten percent (10%). This tax applies
only to guests who stay at hotels and motels within the City for less than 30 days.

This measure would result in an estimated additional $40,000 annually in the City’s general fund
to pay for general municipal services including public safety and infrastructure. Additionally,
the tax would be paid only by those staying in hotels or motels within the City for less than 30
days.

A “yes” vote is a vote in favor of authorizing the increase in the existing Transient Occupancy
Tax. A “no” vote is a vote against authorizing the increase.
