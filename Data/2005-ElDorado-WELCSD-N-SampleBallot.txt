ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF

The West EL Largo Community Services District (WELCSD) uses the
special tax assessment to maintain the roadways of West El Largo Drive,
Stags Leap Road and Sierra East Court. It is estimated that the repair of
the paved road surfaces on West El Largo Drive and Sierra East Court and
removal of the speed bump/water diversion on West El Largo will cost
$5000. The quality of the paved access to our property adds to its value,
and cost of road repair is increased if the roadways are allowed to
deteriorate rather than provide preventative maintenance. The road
surfaces on West El Largo Drive and Sierra East Court will require repaving
in the next five years, and the costs are considerably less if the project can
be accomplished during one time period rather than doing it in increments.
Also, since the homeowners of the WELCSD are liable for any lawsuits or
claims made against the District, it is in the best interest of the homeowners
to protect their home and property against litigation that could result from
incidents occurring on WELCSD roadways. Liability Insurance to cover up
to $1 million per occurrence will cost about $1,100 per year. The current
special tax assessment of $50 per unimproved parcel and from $100 per
improved parcel will not provide funds for road maintenance and repaving,
and liability insurance.

At the Board meeting on March 22, 2005, members of the District provided
input and support regarding an increase in the special tax assessment and
the amount proposed in this ballot measure.
