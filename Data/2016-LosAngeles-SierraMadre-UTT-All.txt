JOHN HARABEDIAN

Age: 34

Occupation: Criminal Prosecutor

I am running for reelection because
there is important work to be done
that requires experienced leadership.

As your councilmember, I have worked the past four
years protecting Sierra Madre in the face of challenges
relating to the City’s budget, water supply, and aging
infrastructure. The next four years will require continued
diligence on all of these fronts. Sierra Madre will remain a
safe, cost-effective, and full-service city as long as we, as
a community, continue to demand quality public services,
while providing the necessary resources to provide such
services.

As your councilmember, I will continue to maintain the
City’s high level of public safety, restore the City’s aged
infrastructure, and protect the City’s independent water
supply.

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact
me at jharabedian@cityofsierramadre.com. Thank you
for your support.

/s/ John Harabedian

During the past four years, I’ve provided strong leadership,
have demonstrated sound analytical skills and have
collaborated effectively with my fellow council members to:

• Fight over-development by completing the General
Plan update and implementing sensible measures
to preserve our small-town character

•	Halt the degradation of our water supply, and
implement steps to secure its long-term viability

•	Ensure that Sierra Madre’s citizens get the most
for their hard-earned tax dollars

•	Ensure that our city government is transparent
and open, where citizens work with their elected
officials and city staff to manage the present and
chart our future

this wonderful town, I want to ensure
that Sierra Madre retains its distinctive character and
charm. Having raised three children here with my wife
Marta, I deeply appreciate the many attributes that make
our town special.

Much remains to be done, especially to stabilize our

overcome our challenges. I am honored to serve you on
Sierra Madre’s City Council, and I thank you in advance
for your support.

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE UUT
PREPARED BY THE CITY ATTORNEY

Measure UUT is submitted to the voters by the Sierra Madre City Council to increase the current rate of the
City’s Utility Users Tax and eliminate the existing “sunset” clause in order to generate and stabilize additional municipal
revenues.

Background.

A utility users’ tax (UUT) is a tax levied on each user of a utility (e.g. telephone, electricity, gas, water, wastewater,
solid waste disposal, cable or video services) within the City’s boundaries. UUT revenues are paid into the City’s
general fund and used to fund city services and programs, including library and public safety services.

The City’s Utility Users’ Tax has been in force since at least 1993. In 2008, the voters approved an incremental
increase in the UUT from 6% to 12%; however pursuant to City Council action, the UUT collection rate never exceeded
10%. The 2008 UUT legislation also included a “sunset clause” to reduce the rate from 12% to 6% over time,
decreasing the rate to 8% on July 1,2015, and again decreasing it to 6% on July 1,2016.

The difference between a 10% UUT and a 6% UUT is approximately $1,000,000 which means that at 6%, there
will be approximately $1,000,000 less revenues for general fund purposes, such as library and public safety.

Eliminating the “sunset” clause is proposed to stabilize general fund revenues.

A UUT Oversight Committee was formed pursuant to the 2008 voter approved UUT measure. The Committee
has tasked with verifying that the additional UUT revenues generated from the 2008 UUT measure would be used to
fund public safety services. The Citizen’s Oversight Committee has determined that the cost of providing public safety
services exceeds the amount of UUT collected at 10%, thereby showing that the City uses the UTT to fund public
safety services and that the service of the Citizen’s Oversight Committee has been fulfilled.

The Measure.

Measure UUT WILL:

•	Increase the existing 8% UUT tax to a maximum of 10% on July 1, 2015.

•	Eliminate the “sunset clause” so that the UUT tax rate will be stabilized at 10%, subject to the City Council’s

discretion to collect less than 10%.

•	Modify the existing exemption to apply to very low-income households.

•	Eliminate the citizen oversight committee as its role has been fulfilled.

Measure UUT WILL NOT:

•	Tax access to the internet;

•	Tax internet purchases and downloads, such as books, music, ringtones, games or similar digital products.

Measure UUT requires approval of a majority of voters. A “yes” vote for Measure UUT will approve the rate
increase described above; a “no” vote will leave in place the City’s existing 6% Utility Users Tax Ordinance.

/s/ Teresa L. Highsmith

Sierra Madre City Attorney

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Ordinance or Measure UUT. If you desire a copy of the
ordinance or measure, please call the elections official’s office at (626) 355-7135 and a copy will be mailed at
no cost to you.

Sierra Madre/ 6

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE UUT

We respectfully ask that Sierra Madre’s citizens approve Measure UUT, which will set the Utility Users Tax (UUT) at 10%
to maintain services that our citizens value and expect, and to keep Sierra Madre a full-service city with its own Police,
Fire, Paramedics, and Library. Measure UUT merely provides a sufficient and stable revenue source to maintain the
current level of services.

The city is now running a deficit of $529,000, which is 6% of expenditures. If Measure UUT is not approved, the deficit
will increase to approximately $1,000,000 next fiscal year. The deficit is caused by the sunset of the 10% UUT which
was the tax rate from fiscal years 2009/2010 through 2013/2014. The lost revenue cannot be made up by increases
in property tax, sales tax, or other revenue sources. Sierra Madre is now spending reserves that were built through
prudent fiscal management and will soon be forced to make severe reductions that will devastate recreational and
community service programs, dramatically reduce library hours, compromise maintenance of facilities, and could
result in outsourcing of one or more departments such as Police, Paramedic or Library.

The City Council recognizes that our citizens demand the most value for their tax dollars and have successfully
implemented cost-cutting initiatives since 2010 that have saved approximately $2,000,000.

The choice is to set the UUT at a 10% rate to preserve our city as we know it, or face devastating cuts where one or
more major departments could be outsourced, or public works, public safety and community services are significantly
curtailed. If Measure UUT fails, the nature and character of this safe, self-sustaining village will change for the worse.

Only you can keep Sierra Madre the very special community that it is. PLEASE VOTE YES on Measure UUT.

/s/ Rachelle Arizmendi, Councilmember

REBUTTAL TO THE ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE UUT

The Sponsors of Measure UUT have not justified an increase in the UUT tax rate from 6% to 10%. This 66% UUT tax
increase would annually impose $1,000,000 in new taxes on our City’s 11,000 citizens.

Instead of addressing spending in a serious way, the sponsors of Measure UUT are trying to persuade us to vote for
more taxes through fear. They want us to believe that without more revenue, our City will be devastated. None of that
is true. We will continue to have law enforcement, a library, and other City services. For example, the City currently
has before it a proposal that will reduce police service costs by over $700,000 annually while increasing actual patrol
hours by 20%. The City has chosen to study that proposal rather than act on it.

The sponsors of the 66% tax increase suggest that since 2010, the City has implemented “cost-cutting initiatives” that
have saved the City $ 2,000,000. That suggestion is false. Any “cost cutting initiatives” have been more than offset by
salary increases, the unnecessary retention of consultants to assist City employees in the performance of their duties,
and other forms of increased spending.

The end result is that since fiscal year 2012/2013 the City’s general fund expenditures have increased from $7,051,508
to $8,286,216. The City’s request for an additional $1,000,000 in annual taxes would have been entirely unnecessary
if it had not chosen to increase annual spending by over $1,200,000. On top of all this, the sponsors of Measure UUT
have chosen to hide the fact that the City is anticipating an increase in property tax revenue of $200,000 per year.

City residents have repeatedly voted against UUT tax increases. The City has chosen to ignore those votes. It is now
time for the City to listen. Prudent fiscal management is needed. Not new taxes.

Please VOTE NO ON MEASURE UUT.

ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE UUT

The City Council is attempting to increase the future UUT tax rate by 66 %. The rate is scheduled to be 6% effective
July, 2016, and the City would like to raise the rate to 10%. The 66% increase equates to increased taxes of
$1,000,000 on a City which has a population of approximately 11,000 citizens. We agree that our City needs to improve
financially. The way to make change is not through additional taxes, but through prudent spending. Government cannot
continue to increase taxes through fear.

The City needs to look at the parts of the budget where change will make a difference. For example, 47% of the City’s
general fund budget is allocated to public safety. A proposal has been brought to the City by the Los Angeles County
Sheriff’s Department which will provide projected annual savings in excess of $700,000. The proposal will not only
save the City money, but will provide increased security and patrol hours. The City is attempting to raise taxes before
consideration of savings in the public safety budget. Savings are available in other departments, but the City has not
pursued.

Future tax increases needs to be restricted for a period of time with a defined purpose, or used for improvements to
our infrastructure. Our first option should not be a permanent increase in taxes, with the revenue used for general
operating expenses.

Change is difficult, we all do it in our personal lives, and our City needs to do the same. We do not need more taxes,
our City needs to be fiscally responsible, and spend our money strategically.

Please VOTE NO ON MEASURE UUT. Let’s take a step back, and review our City budget, make the changes necessary,
and retain Sierra Madre’s status as the crown jewel of the San Gabriel Valley.

/s/ Michael Amerio
/s/ Dave Mysza
/s/ Rick De La Mora

REBUTTAL TO THE ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE UUT

The authors of the Argument Against Measure UUT are attempting to mislead you. Sierra Madre’s budget was balanced
in 2014 with the 10% UUT rate that was in effect at that time. The cause of the projected $1M deficit is the reduction
of the UUT. One of the authors argued in 2014 that natural revenue growth would be sufficient to offset the reduction
of the UUT to 6%. Predictably, he was dead wrong!

Now, the authors want to force the disbanding of the Sierra Madre Police Department. Your City Council has performed
due diligence by commissioning two citizen’s committees - to analyze a preliminary proposal from the Sheriff and
to advise the city on revenue. The Sheriff proposal committee recommendation was to keep and fund our own
police department, which was overwhelmingly supported by public comment. The recommendation of the revenue
committee was to implement a 12% UUT to maintain the current level of services. The City Council is merely proposing
to stabilize the budget and sustain existing services with the 10% rate that was recently in effect.

Through tough fiscal discipline your City Council has made $2,000,000 in cuts over the last six years. Essential
services are all that is left. If Measure UUT fails, dramatic cuts will be made, which may include outsourcing of police
and/or other departments, including the library.

Sierra Madre expects and deserves better! Please join your UNANIMOUS City Council in preserving our beloved Sierra
Madre - Vote YES on Measure UUT!

ORDINANCE NO. 1369

AN ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF SIERRA MADRE, CALIFORNIA, AMENDING
SECTION 3.36.180 (“UTILITY USERS TAX RATE”) OF CHAPTER 3.36 OF THE
SIERRA MADRE MUNICIPAL CODE REGARDING THE UTILITY USERS’ TAX
TO INCREASE AND EXTEND THE RATE STRUCTURETO PRESERVE AND
FUND IMPORTANT CITY SERVICES AND REPEALING SECTION 3.36.230
(“OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE”).

WHEREAS, the City of Sierra Madre has collected a Utility Users Tax (UUT) since 1993; and

WHEREAS, in 2008, the voters approved a maximum rate of 12%, reducing to 10% on July 1, 2014, to 8%
on July 1,2015 and to 6% on July 1,2016;

WHEREAS, the City Council determined in 2010 to collect only 10% UUT until the scheduled reduction to
8% occurred on July 1,2014; and

WHEREAS, the only major sources of general fund revenues, which pay for police, fire and paramedics,
library, and community services are property taxes and the UUT; and

WHEREAS, between fiscal year 2011/12 and 2014/15, more than $1.5 million in general fund reductions have
occurred resulting in corresponding service level reductions and alternative service delivery; and

WHEREAS, each 1% of UUT revenues collected equals approximately $250,000 of the City’s general fund
budget and the reduction in the UUT from 10% to 8% represents a loss of approximately $500,000 annually, resulting
in a projected deficit of $529,000 in fiscal year 2015/16; and

WHEREAS, a reduction in UUT to 6% on July 1,2016 will result in a total reduction of revenues of approximately
$900,000 for fiscal year 2016/17, resulting in a projected permanent deficit of $994,000 annually, as measured against
the fiscal year 2014/15 budget; and

WHEREAS, since May 2014, the City has convened several budget meetings, community input meetings and
town hall study sessions and created a citizen based Revenue Committee to review the current and continuing loss of
revenues and impact on essential City services and evaluate options and alternatives; and

WHEREAS, the Revenue Committee has recommended that the City consider a permanent maximum
12% UUT to help stabilize the general fund revenues which pay for essential City services, including police, fire and
paramedic services, street maintenance, library services and community services; and

WHEREAS, essential safety services within the City are understaffed, the City’s revenue has not kept pace
with its expenses, so that police, fire, paramedics and other employees are paid substantially below their counterparts
in comparable jurisdictions, and infrastructure is deteriorating without the funds to make necessary improvements and
repairs; and

WHEREAS, the UUT Oversight Committee, which was formed in 2008 to review whether the increased
UUT revenue was spent on police, fire and paramedic services, has found that the costs of police, fire and paramedic
services exceed the amount of increased revenue collected by UUT at 10% or less, thereby showing that the City does
use the UUT to fund public safety services; and

WHEREAS, after much consideration, the City Council reached consensus to support a 10% UUT without a
sunset clause as it continues to work on ways to increase the financial stability of the general fund; and

WHEREAS, although some amount of the revenue generated by even a 10% UUT is likely to be lost over time
due to market erosion, changing technology and other factors, setting the UUT at 10% will substantially help stabilize
the current budget and current level of essential services; and

WHEREAS, given that the UUT collected will continue to be less than the cost of City police, fire and
paramedic services, review by an Oversight Committee to determine that the City has directed UUT revenue to pay for
public safety services is an unnecessarily use of valuable citizen volunteer time which can be put to better use in the
City; and

Sierra Madre/9

WHEREAS, the City desires to continue the existing exemption for low income citizens and preserve all other
provisions of the (JUT Ordinance set forth in Chapter 3.36, unless otherwise amended herein.

NOW, THEREFORE, the People of the City of Sierra Madre do ordain, as follows:

lesser rate is established by the city council on or before August 1st of any year.”

Section 2. Section 3.36.200 (“Exemptions”!. Subsection A is amended to read as follows:

3.36.200 Exemptions.

A. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed as imposing a tax upon:

(2)	The City;

(3)	Any individual who uses any utility subject to tax under this Ordinance in or upon any premises
occupied by a household of which that individual is a member and that qualifies as “very low income” as

Public Housing and Section 8 Programs.

Section 3. Section 3.36.230 (“Oversight Committee”) is repealed.

reason held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining sections, sentences,
clauses, phrases, or portions of this Ordinance shall nonetheless remain in full force and effect. The people of the City
of Sierra Madre hereby declare that they would have adopted each section, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of
this Ordinance, irrespective of the fact that any one or more sections, sentences, clauses, phrases, or portions of this
Chapter be declared invalid or unenforceable and, to that end, the provisions of this Ordinance are severable.

Section 6. Execution. The Mayor is hereby authorized to attest to the adoption of this Ordinance by
