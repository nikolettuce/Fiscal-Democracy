IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE F
CITY OF PISMO BEACH
INCREASE IN TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX

State law authorizes general law cities to “levy a tax on the privilege of
occupying a room in a hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, or other
lodging” (including RV parks). The tax is known generally as a "transient
occupancy tax" (also, "bed tax”). The person renting the lodging pays the
tax at the time payment is made for the lodging. The tax is calculated on the
basis of a percentage rate charged against the total cost of the room or
lodging.

Ordinance No. 0-90-11 proposes to increase the City's transient occupancy
tax from the current percentage rate charge of 7% to an increased percentage
rate of 9%, effective January 1,1991.

The increased tax revenue is estimated to be approximately $550,000.00
annually.

As a tax increase to be included in the City’s general fund, the ordinance
must be approved by a majority of the voters voting on the proposition to
approve or deny the tax increase.

A YES vote is a vote for the proposition to increase the transient occupancy
tax.

A NO vote is a vote against the proposition to increase the transient
occupancy tax.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE F

Approval of Measure F will provide new revenues from our tourist economy in
the form of Transient Occupancy Taxes (T.O.T.) for local improvements and
expanded services. THIS IS NOT A TAX INCREASE FOR THE RESIDENTS OF
PISMO BEACH.

The Citizens of Pismo Beach are fortunate to have a clean industry such as
tourism. Approval of Measure F will provide the Community approximately
$550,000 per year additional revenue to aid the City in protecting and
enhancing the quality of life in Pismo Beach.

The City provides general services, such as police, fire, streets, parks, and
recreation to visitors as well as residents. A "YES” vote will ensure balance
between the permanent residents and visitors to protect the level of municipal
services for all who live, work and play in Pismo Beach. THIS NEW REVENUE
WILL BENEFIT ALL THE CITIZENS AND VISITORS IN THE CITY.

YOUR APPROVAL WILL NOT RESULT IN ANY NEW TAX INCREASES FOR
RESIDENTS. Approval will provide needed tourist related revenue to maintain
the quality of life and provide for improvements and maintain essential City
Services. The T.O.T. increase from 7% to 9% will allow the visitor to continue
to pay their fair share for City services and fund new capital improvements.

A "YES" VOTE WILL PROVIDE FUNDING FOR NEW IMPROVEMENTS AND A
CONTINUED HIGH QUALITY OF LIFE FOR ALL OF US.

IMPROVE PISMO BEACH BY VOTING YES ON MEASURE F.
