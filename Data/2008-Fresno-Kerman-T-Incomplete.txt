Section 5.50.010 Definitions. Except where the context otherwise requires, the
Definitions given in this Section govern the construction of this chapter:

A.	Person. “Person” means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture,
association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation,
estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate or any other group or
combination acting as a unit.

B.	Hotel. “Hotel” means:

(a) Any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or
intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling,
lodging, or sleeping purposes and includes any hotel, inn, tourist

home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house,
rooming house, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club,
mobile home or house trailer at a fixed location or other similar
structure or portion thereof; and

(b) Any portion of any real property occupied, intended to be occupied,
or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or
sleeping purposes in any recreational vehicle, trailer, trailer coach,
house car or motor home, and includes campgrounds and recreation
vehicle parks.

C.	Occupancy. “Occupancy” means: The use or of, possession, of the right
to use or possess any space, area, or room(s) or portion thereof in any
hotel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes.

D.	Transient. “Transient” means any person who exercises occupancy or is
entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access,
license or other agreement for a period of thirty (30) consecutive calendar
days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such
person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient
until the period of thirty (30) days has expired unless there is an
agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for
a longer period of occupancy.

E.	Rent. “Rent” means the consideration charged, whether or not received,
for the occupancy of space in a hotel, valued in money, whether to be
received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash,
credits and property and services of any kind or nature, without any
deduction therefrom whatsoever.

F.	Operator. “Operator” means the person who is proprietor of the hotel,
whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, subleasee, mortgagee in
possession, licensee or any other capacity. Where the operator performs
his functions through a managing agent of any type or character other
than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator
for the purposes of this Chapter and shall have the same duties and
liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this Chapter
by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be
considered to be compliant by both.

5.50.020. Tax Imposed. For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each
transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of eight percent (8%) of the
rent charged by the operator. Said tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the
city which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city. The transient
shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is
paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each
installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient ceasing to occupy space in
the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the City
Clerk may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the City Finance Department.

5.50.030. Exemptions. No tax shall be imposed upon: a) Any person as to
whom, when in the performance of that person’s official duties, or any occupancy as to
which, it is beyond the power of the City to impose the tax herein provided; or b) Any
officer or employee of a foreign government who is exempt by reason of express
provision of federal law or international treaty.

No exemption shall be granted except upon a claim therefore made at the time rent is
collected and under penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by the City Clerk. The
transient shall be required to provide the necessary proof of exemption. Governments
and governmental agencies are generally not exempt from taxation. A copy of eligible
