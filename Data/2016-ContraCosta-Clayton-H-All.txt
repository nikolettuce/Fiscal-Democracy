CITY OF CLAYTON - MEASURE: h		
CITYWIDE TRAILS AND LANDSCAPE MAINTENANCE DISTRICT CONTINUATION OF EXISTING SERVICES AND SPECIAL PARCEL TAX  Shall the existing Community Facility District 2007-1 (Trails and Landscape Maintenance District) be continued, with a Citizens Oversight Committee, for ten years to fund on-going operations and maintenance of the trails system, roadway landscape, open space weed abatement, and related expenses at the current annual special tax’s rate and methodology (presently $234.84/year per residential and non-residential parcel or fraction thereof),for FYs 2017=2027?	YES	
	NO	

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

Measure H would extend the special tax levied for the maintenance and operation of the City of Clayton’s
Citywide Trails and Landscape Maintenance District, known officially as Community Facilities District 2007-1
(“CFD”) through Fiscal Year 2026/2027. This measure would not change the services provided by the CFD,
the rate of adjustment or the method of apportioning the special parcel tax and requires the continuation of the
Citizens Oversight Committee. The CFD’s boundaries encompass the entire City of Clayton.

The tax revenue pays for costs related to the on-going operations and maintenance of the CFD’s trails system,
roadway landscape, open space weed abatement and fire breaks, including landscaping, irrigation, hardscape,
lights, and electricity. The tax revenues are placed into a restricted fund through which all eligible expenses are
tracked, paid and audited. The funds cannot be spent for any other purpose by the City or other agencies.

Following the advertised public hearing on March 1, 2016, the City Council adopted Resolution No. 12-2016
proposing to continue the special parcel tax in the CFD for ten years and placing Measure H on the ballot. In
2007, voters approved a special tax to fund the CFD through Fiscal Year 2016/2017. The current annual
special tax amounts are:

Residential Parcels: $ 234.84 per parcel per year.

Non-Residential Parcels: $234.84 per parcel or fraction thereof per year.

The ballot measure continues the same tax rate methodology and same annual adjustment, including limiting
any increases to the annual CPI, with no annual rate increase higher than 3% over the previous year. The
proposed ballot measure would continue this same formula for an additional 10 years, until June 30,2027.

Measure H requires approval from two-thirds of voters. If Measure H is not approved, the special tax will
sunset and expire in June 2017. If Measure H is approved, the special tax will sunset and expire June 30,
2027.

Copies of all relevant reports, a boundary map of the CFD, and Council resolutions concerning the formation
of the CFD are available for review in the office of the City Clerk (925-673-7300).

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure H. If you desire a copy of the measure, please call
the City Clerk's office at (925-673-7300) and a copy will be mailed at no cost to you.

This analysis is prepared as an impartial analysis of the measure as required by California Government Code
Section 53327 and Elections Code Section 9280.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE H

In 1997, Clayton, recognizing the importance of^ublic landscaping and how it defines our
community, established a Community Facility District, knowflas the Trails and Landscape
Maintenance District (District) to provide for maintenance costs for trails, open space, weed
abatement, fire breaks and roadside landscaping. A 10-year parcel tax was adopted insuring
funding for Clayton's landscaping.

In 2007, $$ the parcel tax neared its end, Clayton residents, led by a citizen Blue Ribbon
Committee, reviewed the District's successes and challenges during the initial 10-year period.
The importance of Clayton's "Front Yard" was reaffirmed, and a new plan built upon lessons
learned was recommended. It included establishing a Trails and Landscape Committee (TLC),
comprised of Clayton volunteers appointed by the City Council to insure continued community
input. The 10-year parcel tax was overwhelming extended. Today, though we have
experienced significant economic uncertainty these past 10 years, Clayton continues to enjoy
safe, efficient and tasteful public landscaping that enhances our community, thanks to the
efforts of its citizens and the dedicated resources provided through the District.

Now, the time has come again to continue the District. Measure H extends the current tax's
rate and methodology (presently $234.84/year per parcel) for an additional 10 years, through
2027, and provides the necessary funding for the District, with the TLC continuing to provide
District oversight and management.

Currently, this tax generates approximately $lM/yr and is used exclusively for the District. As
it was in 1997, and again in 2007, the Clayton's modest General Fund budget is unable to
adequately provide for our public landscaping. Without this funding, Clayton's landscaping
would rapidly decline and the beauty and character of Clayton would be forever changed.
Please join us in supporting Measure H for the continued beautification of Clayton.

tax supporting and funding the Citywide Landscape Maintenance District
____________by	a	local	ballot measure on the June 2016 Election.___________

RECOMMENDATION

Following the staff report and public comment, City Council to determine policy direction
to staff regarding the proposed 10-year time extension to the existing special parcel tax
for the Citywide Landscape District (CFD 2007-1), retaining the current tax rate
methodology: and adopt the attached Resolution of Consideration, setting the public
hearing for March 1,2016.

BACKGROUND

Generally citywide public landscaping services on roadways, trails and open space have
always been funded by a special revenue levied on private properties throughout the
City. Prior to 1997, the City of Clayton had two (2) special tax districts for the care and
maintenance of public roadway landscaping, trails and open space. The ‘‘Clayton
Landscape Maintenance District” covered neighborhoods in the original sections of town
and had an annual tax rate of $112.20. A newer second District known as the “Oakhurst
Landscape Maintenance District” was created with the residential Oakhurst Development
and had an annual tax rate of $205.00 In addition there were other sections of the City
that were not included in any landscape maintenance district (e.g. Dana Hills), although
they received similar general benefits for the care and maintenance of citywide roadway
landscaping, trails and open space.

To correct this inconsistency and establish one (1) uniform special tax rate for the
maintenance of the general benefit areas, voters in November 1997 passes Measure E
that created a Citywide Landscape Maintenance District (CFD 1997-1) for a ten (10)
year period. The special tax was replaced by CFD 2007-1 in June 2007.

In 2007 a new Community, Facilities District (CFD) was established to replace the old
1997 Landscape Maintenance District. The City Council and Clayton voters established
(CFD) 2007-1, to receive dedicated maintenance and operation funds if the public voted

Subject: Consider a proposed 10-year time extension to an existing special real property parcel tax supporting
and funding the Citywide Landscape Maintenance District by a local ballot measure on the June 2016
Election.

for a special parcel tax. The tax revenue pays for costs related to the operation,
maintenance, repair and replacement landscaping, irrigation, roadway landscaping, trails and
open space including fire breaks. City parks are not maintained by this special tax (but
through the General Fund). In June 2007 a ballot measure for such dedicated funds was
placed before the voters for the special tax known as Measure “B” for a 10 year period
through FY 16/17. It received 82.94% voter approval (more than the minimum 66,66%
required for a special tax). The special tax has been levied on the real property tax bills
since FY 07/08. The City Council also set forth a Citizens Oversight Committee for the
Landscape Maintenance District

DISCUSSION

The Trails and Landscape Committee (TLC) reviewed and considered this matter at three
meetings: March 16, 2015, June 6, 2015 and January 11, 2016. The TLC unanimously
recommended:

•	The CFD 2007-1 Landscape Maintenance District extension be placed before the
voters in the June 2016 election.

•	The time period be for 10 years

•	The tax rate methodology as currently exists.

•	Retain the citizens oversight committee

This special tax serves as the sole funding source for the Landscape Maintenance District
Downtown Park Operation and Maintenance - known officially as Community Facilities
District (CFD) 2007-1. To levy the tax the City placed a ballot measure on the November
2007 consolidated election and received more than the minimum vote threshold (66.66%) to
enact the tax.

The tax revenue pays for costs related to the operation, maintenance, repair and
replacement landscaping, irrigation, roadway landscaping, trails and open space including
fire breaks. City parks are not maintained by this special tax (but through the General Fund).

The actual collection of the tax is done by the County. Established in the current voter-
approved tax is the authorization after the initial year, to increase the assessment by the CPI
with a maximum of 3% annually. It is recommended the City Council direct staff to prepare
the public notice for a hearing on March 1, 2016 for consideration of the ballot information for
the June 2016 election which would extend the time period of the tax by 10 years beyond its
expiration in 2017 with the same tax rate methodology.

In order to extend the current special tax to a longer period, the process requires technically
the levying a new special tax in the CFD to extend the current tax; and consists of three
major steps: (1) adopting a Resolution of Consideration to start the process, (2) conducting a
public hearing on the Resolution and (3) submitting the tax extension to the voters. The
enclosed Resolution of Consideration is the first step. It would schedule a public hearing for
March 1st for affected parties to provide comments regarding the proposal. As long as less
than half of all affected property owners do not submit written protests regarding the proposal
at the hearing, the City Council can submit the measure to the voters at the June election.
The measure requires two-thirds (66.66%) voter support to be approved.

Subject: Consider a proposed 10-year time extension to an existing special real property parcel tax supporting
and funding the Citywide Landscape Maintenance District by a local ballot measure on the June 2016
Election.

Council’s consideration.

FISCAL IMPACT

For fiscal year 2015-16 fiscal year the total annual levy amount was $234.34 per residential
parcel, or per acre or fraction thereof for non-residential parcels.

Currently there are approximately 4,103 parcels subject to the special tax; of these 4,043 are
residential and approximately 60 are non-residential. The total amount of revenue received
from this tax for FY 2015-16 is $1,029,751. These tax revenues are placed into a Special
Revenue (restricted use) Fund (No. 210) through which all eligible expenses are tracked,
paid and audited. Allowable expenses include only that for the purposes of the Landscape
District Operation and Maintenance District such as materials, supplies, equipment, utilities,
labor, and administration 9currently $33863/year; 3.3%).

If the special tax is not placed before the voters the last tax levy will occurs in FY 16/17 and
thereafter there is no funding to continue its operations and maintenance. It is improbable to
imagine the City’s $4 million General Fund budget could absorb this annual $1 million service
considering Police operations use 51.7% of the General Fund Budget.

No general fund monies will be expended in connection with this ballot measure; cost for
the ballot portion related to the Landscape Maintenance Tax would be paid for out of the
CFD Funds. The cost for an election are less expensive when combined with a
consolidated election cycle rather off year (ie: 2015) election cycle. If the election is held
in the next election cycle (June 2016) and is unsuccessful there remains an opportunity
to place it on the November 2016 election without a gap in the funding stream.

CONCLUSION

It is recommended the City Council direct staff to prepare necessary documents to set a
public hearing on March 1, 2016 and authorize other matters relating thereto, for
proceeding with the process for placement of a time extension of 10 years with the same
tax rate methodology of Community Facilities District (CFD 2007-1) special tax for the
Landscape Maintenance District on the June 2016 election ballot.

Re:	Landscape Maintenance District Renewal of CFD 2007

The Trails and Landscape Committee considered and reviewed at its March 16, 2015
meeting and June 2015 making a recommendation to the City Council of placing on the
June 7, 2016 ballot a measure for the voters to consider extending the Landscape
Maintenance District special tax called Community Facilities District 2007-1. This special
tax was established by the voters in June 2007. The tax had a 10 year time limit, unless
revote by the electorate. The tax is a special tax which requires 66.66% of the votes cast to
be in favor to pass, in June 2007 It received 82.94% support. This is the final meeting for
the TLC to discuss and finalize its recommendation to the City Council. The City Council
will be discussing this matter at its January 19, 2016 meeting.

At the March and June meeting the TLC considered alternative time frames of 15 and 20
years in addition to the 10 years. The TLC also discussed if different funding methodology
should be used. After discussion at the June meeting, the TLC felt the 10 year time frame
was better as it was consistent with what the voters previously approved. Also identified
was a longer period might lock down a rate where change might be needed after 10 years.

The TLC also expressed a preference for keeping the same methodology, as a different
methodology (establishing a higher base rate to start with or higher annual adjustment)
require additional time to prepare the needed information, and potentially more uncertainty
with the voters as to the change. TLC indicated by keeping the same methodology etc.
there would be less uncertainty with voters and a potential higher potential of passage.
Staff has provided the above summary so that the TLC can confirm their preference as this
is the last time to consider prior to moving forward to the City Council. TLC also asked for
staff to bring back the annual levy rate history and rate increases under the current
methodology for final confirmation of their preference/direction. Staff has also prepared
three options for discussion of potential ballot wording should the TLC also like to provide
input to the City Council.

Attached is a draft schedule of the time frame that would be involved for placing a ballot
measure before the voters, the history of the annual tax levy amount and increases. [Note
the current methodology specifies that the annual rate may increase by the CPI not to
exceed 3% annually. The history shows that over the last 9 years the CP! rate did not
exceed 3% the amount varied from a low of 0.8% to a high of 2.88%.

Staff has also attached the prior (June 2007) ballot information including election results,
ballot wording, methodology, attorney impartial analysis, and map as background.

The Trails and Landscape Committee, acting as the Measure B Citizens Oversight
Committee, will need to provide a final recommendation to the City Council regarding the
expiration of the current tax and placing a measure before the voters in 2016 for a new tax,

i.e.: continuation of the current tax, the rate and methodology.

The recommendation of the TLC should include:

• Should there be a measure be placed before the voters in June 2016?

[Alternatively if done in November 2016 and fails there would not be another
opportunity without another source of funds available to maintain the current
roadway landscaping and trails maintenance]

If a measure is placed before the voters in June 2016:

• What should the duration be? (The current time frame was for 10 years, options include
5,10,15 years or 20 years).

The TLC previously indicated a preference for 10 years same as the current
measure.

• What should be the amount (continue with same rate and same formula or different
base amount and formula).

The TLC previously indicated a preference for keeping the same rate and
methodology formula - ie: residential at same rate; non-residential at the base rate
for each acre or fraction thereof, with an annual increase the CPI but not to exceed
3% annually.

• Does the TLC want to recommend a preference on ballot wording
[Note: The City Council will make the final ballot wording].

Staff has prepared three ballot wording options for review and discussion.

• Does the TLC want to establish an Ad Hoc committee to work on ballot measure
education information (education and outreach not advocacy).

This could include articles in the paper, attending community events and community
meetings such as Clayton Cleans Up, Art and Wine, CBCA, Rotary etc., with
informational handout materials and informational photo display showing actions
taken by the LMD over since 2007.

Re:	Landscape Maintenance District Renewal of CFD 2007

As was reviewed at your March 16, 2015 meeting, the Clayton Landscape Maintenance District
has a special tax called Community Facilities District 2006, which will be expiring in November
2017. This special tax was established by the voters in June 2007. The tax had a 10 year time
limit, unless revote by the electorate.

At your March meeting staff recommended and the TLC concurred that a renewal or extended
measure should be placed before the voters on the June 2016 ballot. The tax is a special tax
which requires 66.66% of the votes cast to be in favor to pass. By placing it on the June 2016
ballot it would allow for another consideration in November 2016 should it not be successful.
However the November 2016 consideration (only if June was not to get the required minimum
votes) would need to be different - different can be a different time frame and/or a different
amount; however it cannot be the exact same as was previously considered in the most recent
election.

The Trails and Landscape Committee, acting as the Measure B Citizens Oversight Committee,
will need to provide a recommendation to the City Council at their September or October
meeting regarding the expiration of the current tax and placing a measure before the voters in
2016 for a new tax, i.e.: continuation of the current tax, the rate and methodology.

In order to meet the schedule the TLC will need to finalize its recommendation in
August/September. The TLC can establish an Ad-Hoc committee of up to four members to work
on this aspect with staff over the next few months in order to have options prepared timely for the
entire TLC to review and consider at a public meeting in August/September. Attached is an
updated draft schedule of the time frame that would be involved for placing a ballot measure
before the voters.

Some of the considerations will be:

What should the duration be (how long-the current time frame was for 10 years; should it be
longer such as 15 or 20 years.

What should be the amount [continue with same rate and same formula or different base amount
and formula (If there is a different methodology desired, additional analysis will be required and
new legal reports prepared, and possibly additional public meetings could be required)].

MEETING DATE:	February	16,2016

SUBJECT:	Consider proposed Ballot Measure ianguage regarding extension of

Citywide Landscape Maintenance District (CFD 2007-1) special annual tax
____________for voter consideration at the June 2016 Election.____________

RECOMMENDATION

Following the staff report and public comment, City Council to provide direction to staff
on their preference of potential ballot wording, related to the Landscape District funding
measure for the June 2016 election. The final wording will be brought back at the March
1,2016 City Council public hearing for final action.

BACKGROUND

In 2007 a new Community Facilities District (CFD) was established to replace the old
1997 Landscape Maintenance District. The City Council and Clayton voters established
(CFD) 2007-1, to receive dedicated maintenance and operation funds if the public voted
for a special parcel tax. The tax revenue is the only funding source to pay for costs related
to the operation, maintenance, repair and replacement landscaping, irrigation, roadway
landscaping, trails and open space including fire breaks. City parks are not maintained by
this special tax (but through the General Fund). In June 2007 a ballot measure for such
dedicated funds was placed before the voters for the special tax known as Measure “B”
for a 10 year period through FY 16/17. It received 82.94% voter approval (more than the
minimum 66.66% required for a special tax). The special tax has been levied on the real
property tax bills since FY 07/08. The City Council also set forth a Citizens Oversight
Committee for the Landscape Maintenance District.

DISCUSSION

The TLC recommended and the City Council approved at its January 19th meeting, to set the
public hearing on March 1, 2016 to authorize submittal to the voters in the June election
continuing by 10 years the existing special parcel tax for the Citywide Landscape District
(CFD 2007-1), and retaining the current tax rate methodology.

At the January TLC meeting staff provided three potential options for ballot wording for their
review and recommendation to the City Council. The TLC did not indicate a specific
preference between the options, noting that they were not familiar with the nuisances of
specific ballot wording. However, the TLC provide suggested wording modifications to
emphasize the trails system (listing first in the sentence of what the funds pay for) and

preferred the word of continue over extend, and the word current over existing where
possible; and to include the duration as 10 years. They also suggested that oversight by the
Citizens Committee be included in the ballot language if possible, noting that word limits may
not allow. The TLC ultimately stated they would defer to the City Council who has had more
experience in such matter as to the ballot measure wording.

The election regulations set the ballot measure wording to a maximum of 75 words. Staff has
prepared three potential options, with the TLC input noted, for discussion of potential ballot
Warding for the City Council. The Staff has also attached the prior (June 2007) ballot
language and the recent Grove Park ballot language as additional information

FISCAL IMPACT

For fiscal year 2015-16 fiscal year the total annual levy amount was $234.84 per residential
parcel, or per acre or fraction thereof for non-residential parcels.

Currently there are approximately 4,103 parcels subject to the special tax; of these 4,043 are
residential and approximately 60 are non-residential. The total amount of revenue received
from this tax for FY 2015-16 is $1,029,751. These are these are the sole source of funds for
maintenance and operation of the Landscape Maintenance District. These tax revenues are
placed into a Special Revenue (restricted use) Fund (No. 210) through which all eligible
expenses are tracked, paid and audited. Allowable expenses include only that for the
purposes of the Landscape District Operation and Maintenance District such as materials,
supplies, equipment, utilities, labor, and administration (currently $33,863/year; 3.3%).

CONCLUSION

It is recommended the City Council direct staff to prepare ballot wording (up to 75 words)
for City Council consideration and action at the public hearing on March 1, 2016. The
City Council may also select up to two members to work with staff on refining ballot
wording for final consideration by the City Council at its March 1,2016 public hearing,

TO:	HONORABLE MAYOR AND COUNCIL MEMBERS

FROM:	Laura Hoffmeister, Assistant to the City Manager

MEETING DATE:	March	1,2016

SUBJECT:	Public Hearing to consider a proposed 10-year continuance to the existing

Community Facilities District’s (CFD’s) annual real property special parcel tax
that funds the Citywide Trails and Landscape District annual operation and
maintenance by placement of a local ballot measure on the June 2016 General
___________Primary	Election.__________________________________________________

RECOMMENDATION

Upon conclusion of the staff report, and any public comments received from the public
hearing, it is recommended the City Council:

1.	Adopt the attached Resolution associated with placing a ballot measure for a 10 year
continuance of the operation and maintenance of the existing Citywide Trails and
Landscape District’s [Community Facilitates District (CFD) 2007-1], special parcel tax for
voter consideration at the voters on the June 7,2016 election.

2.	By motion establish an ad-hoc committee of the City Council to prepare and submit the
ballot argument in support of the measure, and any rebuttal argument.

BACKGROUND

Generally citywide public landscaping services on roadways, trails and open space have
always been funded by a special revenue levied on private properties throughout the City.
Prior to 1997, the City of Clayton had two (2) special tax districts for the care and
maintenance of public roadway landscaping, trails and open space. The “Clayton Landscape
Maintenance District” covered neighborhoods in the original sections of town and had an
annual tax rate of $112.20. A newer second District known as the “Oakhurst Landscape
Maintenance District” was created with the residential Oakhurst Development and had an
initial annual special parcel tax rate of $205.00. In addition there were other sections of the
City that were not included in any landscape maintenance district (e.g. Dana Hills), although
they received similar general benefits for the common care and maintenance of citywide
roadway landscaping, trails and open space.

To correct this inconsistency and establish one (1) uniform special tax rate for the
maintenance of the general benefit areas, voters in November 1997 passed Measure E that
created a Citywide Landscape Maintenance District (CFD 1997-1) for a ten (10) year period.
That special parcel tax was replaced by CFD 2007-1 in June 2007.

Subject: Consider a proposed 10-year continuance to an existing special real property special parcel tax supporting
and funding the Citywide Trails and Landscape operation and maintenance by a local ballot measure on the
June 2016 Primary Election.

Meeting Date: March 1,2016

Paoe2 of 5____________________________________________________________________________________

In 2007 a new Community Facilities District (CFD) was established to replace the old 1997
Landscape Maintenance District. The City Council and Clayton voters established (CFD)
2007-1, to receive dedicated maintenance and operation funds if the public voted fora special
parcel tax. The tax revenue pays for costs related to the operation, maintenance, repair and
replacement landscaping, irrigation, roadway landscaping, trails and open space including fire
breaks. City parks are not maintained by this special tax (but through the General Fund). In June
2007 a ballot measure for such dedicated funds was placed before the voters for the special
tax known as Measure “B" for a 10 year period through FY 16/17. It received 82.94% voter
approval (more than the minimum 66.66% required for a special tax). The special tax has
been levied on the real property tax bills since FY 07/08. The City Council also set forth a
Citizens Oversight Committee for the Landscape Maintenance District. The Citizens Advisory
Committee has met frequently and has guided the use of the funds over the last 10 years; and
produces an independent Annual Public Report on the funds received and the use of the
funds.

The Trails and Landscape Committee (TLC) reviewed and considered this funding continuance
matter at three public meetings: March 16,2015, June 6, 2015 and January 11, 2016. The TLC
unanimously recommended:

•	The CFD 2007-1 Landscape Maintenance District’s extension be placed before the voters
in the June 2016 election.

•	The time period be for 10 years

•	The tax rate methodology remain as it currently exists.

•	Retain the citizens oversight committee

At its January 19, 2016 public meeting the City Council directed staff to move forward on the
June 2016 election, the consideration of a continuance of the Citywide Trails and Landscape
District [Community Facilitates District (CFD) 2007-1], special parcel tax with the same tax
rate and methodology, and formally adopted a Resolution [No. 06-2016] to schedule the
required ballot measure public hearing for March 1,2016.

DISCUSSION

At the January 19, 2016 meeting the City Council did authorize an ad-hoc group of the legislative
body (Councilmembers Pierce and Haydon) to work with staff on the ballot measure wording. The
March 1,2016 public hearing is the last step in the process to place the ballot measure before the
voters on the upcoming election. The City Council will be taking final action on directing the
placement of the ballot on the June 7, 2016 election, the final ballot wording (included in the
Resolution), directing the City Attorney to prepare the required impartial analysis; and authorize an
ad hoc committee of the legislative body to prepare the ballot argument in support of the measure.
As long as less than half of all affected property owners do not submit written protests regarding
the proposal at this hearing, the City Council can at this meeting submit the measure to the voters
at the June primary election. The measure requires two-thirds (66.66%) voter support to be
approved as a special purpose tax.

Subject: Consider a proposed 10-year continuance to an existing special real property special parcel tax supporting
and funding the Citywide Trails and Landscape operation and maintenance by a local ballot measure pn the
June 2016 Primary Election.

Meeting Date: March 1,2016

Page 3 of 5___________________________________________________________________________

The ballot measure continues the same tax rate methodology and the same annual
adjustment in the Consumer Price Index but in no event can the annual rate increase be
higher than 3% over the previous year.

This special tax serves as the sole funding source for the Citywide Trails and Landscape
Operations and Maintenance - known officially as Community Facilities District (CFD) 2007-1.
There are not sufficient funds elsewhere in the General Fund budget to undertake the ongoing
$1,029,751 operational and maintenance costs of the trails, public roadway open space weed
abatement. The tax revenue pays for costs related to the operation, maintenance, repair and
replacement landscaping, irrigation, handscape, lights, water, electricity, weed abatement, etc. City
parks are not maintained by this special tax (but through the General Fund, except for The Grove
Park which has its own separate voter approved funding special tax).

The rate for FY 15/16 is $234.84 per year for single-family residential parcels and per non-
residential parcel or fraction thereof. The non-residential parcels the current rate is $234.84 per
parcel or fraction thereof. The amounts may be increased by vote of the City Council in accord
with the annual increase of the CPI annually with a maximum cap of 3% annual increase.

Currently there are approximately 4,103 parcels subject to the special tax; of these 4,043 are
residential and approximately 60 are non-residential. The total amount of revenue received from
this tax for FY 2015-16 is $1,029,751. These tax revenues are placed into a Special Revenue
(restricted use) Fund (No. 210) through which all eligible expenses are tracked, paid and audited.
Allowable expenses include only that for the purposes of the Landscape District Operation and
Maintenance District such as materials, supplies, equipment, utilities, labor, and administration
(currently $33,863/yean 3.3%).

If the special tax is not placed before the voters the last tax levy will occurs in FY 16/17 and
thereafter there is no funding to continue its operations and maintenance. It is improbable to
imagine the City’s $4 million General Fund budget could absorb this annual $1 million service
considering Police operations use 51.7% of the General Fund Budget.

No general fund monies will be expended in connection with this ballot measure; cost for the
ballot portion related to the Landscape Maintenance Tax would be paid for out of the CFD
Funds.

All revenues generated by the CFD's annual special tax have been and would continue to be
used solely for the operation and maintenance of the Citywide Trails and Landscape District
annual operation and maintenance. The CFD's funds cannot be spent for any other purpose
by the City and cannot be “stolen” by state budget schemes. All tax revenues remain local
with the exception of an annual fee that must be paid by the CFD for the County's collection of
this special tax with the property tax bills. With voter approval, the CFD's special tax would
commence in tax year 2017-2018 and would expire at the end of tax year 2026-2027 (June
30,2027).

and funding the Citywide Trails and Landscape operation and maintenance by a local ballot measure on the
June 2016 Primary Election.

BALLOT MEASURE AND ELECTION PROCEDURES

The City Council, by virtue of calling the election and the author of the ballot measure, retains
the authority to write the actual ballot measure text. The Resolution calling the Election
incorporates the text of the ballot measure itself that will appear on the voter's actual ballot
and in the Voter Information Pamphlet.

The measure’s text including ballot title (except city name and measure letter) is limited to 75
words, as counted pursuant to the CA Elections Code. New legislation (effective January 1,
2016) also requires the ballot measure to include the total amount of revenue generated per
year to be included in the ballot measure wording. The City Council may modify the proposed
ballot measure prior to adoption of this Resolution, provided the modifications result in a text
not exceeding 75 words. An ad-hoc committee of the City Council (Pierce and Haydon)
worked with the City staff to craft the recommended ballot wording contained in the attached
Resolution.

The City Attorney is also directed by the enactment of this Resolution to prepare an impartial
analysis of the proposed ballot measure. The impartial analysis will be printed in the local
Voter Information Pamphlet provided to each registered voter in Clayton, and must be filed
with the City Clerk by the August 19th deadline.

Further, the Resolution calling the Election establishes a deadline date of August 24, 2016 for
submittal of any Arguments For or Against the proposed measure. (Corresponding Rebuttal
Arguments must be filed with the City Clerk by August 29, 2016).

As author and proponent of the ballot measure, the City Council may authorize two of its
members to author the Argument In Favor of the ballot measure, in addition to penning the
Rebuttal Argument if any. In doing such this argument is for printing in the Voter Pamphlet
(ie: Election Guide), and is placed above any interested citizens or individual members of
Council acting on their own,

FISCAL IMPACT

No General Fund monies will be expended in connection with this ballot measure; cost for the
ballot portion related to the Citywide Trails and Landscape Maintenance District special parcel
tax would be paid from the CFD 2007-1 Funds. The cost for this election is less expensive as
it will be combined with a consolidated primary election cycle rather than off year (i.e.: 2017)
or special election cycle. If the election is unsuccessful the last opportunity would be to place
a different measure on the next general election cycle (November 2016); thereafter if
unsuccessful there would be no opportunity to place it on a future election without a gap in the
funding stream and resultant loss of public services paid by this Fund.

With the consolidation benefit, the election cost for the ballot measure is only the
incremental expense for printing and distribution of a Voter Information Pamphlet about the
ballot measure to each registered voter in Clayton. The County Elections Office has informed
our City Clerk they expect this cost to be approximately $10,000 (for 2-6 pages of ballot
information). The cost of this ballot measure election must be paid by the Citywide Trails and

Landscape District Fund and such expenditure was incorporated into the Citywide Trails and
Landscape District annual operation and maintenance budget in FY 15/16 adopted by the City
Council. The attached Resolution also includes in Section 9, appropriate language to ensure
the funding for the election costs of the ballot measure are paid from The Trails and
Landscape Maintenance District’s (CFD 2007-1) special funds.

The actual collection of the tax is done by the County, and the County collection costs are also
paid for by the CFD. Established in the current voter-approved tax is the authorization after the
initial year, to Increase the assessment by the CPI with a maximum cap of 3% annually. The
proposed ballot measure would continue this same formula for an additional 10 yearn.
