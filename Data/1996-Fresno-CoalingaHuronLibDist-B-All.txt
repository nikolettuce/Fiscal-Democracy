COALINGA-HURON LIBRARY DISTRICT SPECIAL TAX MEASURE B

(Argument in Favor)

YOUR LIBRARY NEEDS HELP!

THE LIBRARY DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY to provide books and magazines for its patrons. The
library’s tax revenues have been declining at the same time the population has been going up. So the library
must serve more people.

THE LIBRARY HAS CUT COSTS every way it can. The Library has already;

—laid off most of its part time employees, including the reference librarian
—dropped subscriptions to many magazines and newspapers

—cut back drastically on book purchases (including Reference books)	I

—put off replacing old equipment (the A/C in Coaiinga was installed in 1955)	I

—stopped buying videos, computer software and music
—discontinued all equipment and lawn maintenance agreements
THE LIBRARY CANNOT RAISE TAXES or charge fees to use the library. Only a vote of the people can help.

IF YOU DON’T HELP THE LIBRARY WILL HAVE TO CLOSE SEVERAL DAYS A WEEK.

10-23

YOU CAN HELP by voting YES on the Library’s special tax proposal. The tax would be a flat tax on each
parcel of land, paid by the owner of the land. A homeowner would pay only $12 a year—LESS THAN THE
AVERAGE BOOK!

This small tax would help the Library buy more books and other materials for you to use, enjoy, and learn
from. HELP SAVE YOUR LOCAL LIBRARY—vote YES on Measure B!
