MEASURE D

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE D

We depend almost totally on volunteers for fire protection and initial
emergency medical response. 85% of our 911 calls actually are medical
emergencies.

I SHALL THE GLENCOE-RAIL ROAD FLAT FIRE PROTECTION
DISTRICT LEVY, FOR A PERIOD OF NINE YEARS (9), AN
ANNUAL SPECIAL TAX IN THE AMOUNT OF $40.00 PER
S PARCEL OF LAND WITHIN THE DISTRICT BOUNDARIES,
SUCH TAX BEING NECESSARY FOR CONSOLIDATION WITH
! THE MOUNTAIN RANCH FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT?

I A "YES" vote on this Measure would authorize the Glencoe-Rail Road
I Flat Fire Protection District to levy an annual special tax in the amount of $40.00 for each parcel of land within the District boundaries. This special tax levy would be in effect for a period of nine years.

According to the Resolution calling the election, the special tax levy
is proposed in order to provide adequate revenue to sustain District
activities at a level commensurate with the needs of the District
residents and to facilitate a possible consolidation of the Glencoe-Rail
Road Flat Fire Protection District with the Mountain Ranch Fire
Protection District. The Mountain Ranch Fire Protection District
currently has a similar special tax in effect. The Resolution expresses
the opinion of the Glencoe-Rail Road Flat Fire Protection District that
; it would not be possible to consolidate with the Mountain Ranch Fire
Protection District if there is no equal per parcel special tax. Should
the special tax measure fail, there probably will be no consolidation
with the Mountain Ranch Fire Protection District.

A "NO" vote on this Measure is a vote against the levy of a special
' tax.

Measure D will improve these critical emergency services by allowing
the Glencoe-Rail Road Flat and the Mountain Ranch Fire Protection
Districts to form into a single Department. By combining resources,
the new department will provide more and better trained volunteer
responders, upgraded equipment and facilities, and improved response
times. The new department also will be able to move toward the use
of some full-time professional firefighters to supplement our dedicated
volunteers.

The formation agreement, which already has been approved by both
Boards, guarantees that the newly elected Board of Directors will
keep equipment and facilities within the Glencoe-Rail Road Flat area.
But, Measure D must pass before the new district can become a
reality. The residents of Mountain Ranch already have adopted their
version of Measure D, now it is our turn to demonstrate our commitment
to fire and medical safety. Forty dollars a year (less than $.80 a
week) is a modest investment in the things we hold most dear; the
safety of our families and the protection of our homes.

Please, Vote Yes on Measure D. We canâ€™t afford not to!
