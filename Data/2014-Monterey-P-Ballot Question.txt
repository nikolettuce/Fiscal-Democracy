Ballot question

The question on the ballot appeared as:[i]

Shall the City of Monterey address significant deferred maintenance by
fixing streets, sidewalks, and potholes; improve related access and safety
for senior citizens, disabled residents, and others; and repair its
100-year-old storm drain system to protect our beaches/Monterey Bay, by 95
enacting a one cent per dollar transactions and use ("sales") tax to sunset
in 4 years, with all revenue exclusively applied to these specific purposes,
subject to citizen oversight and annual financial/performance audits? [2]
