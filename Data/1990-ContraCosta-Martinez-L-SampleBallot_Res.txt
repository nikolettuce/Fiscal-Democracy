REBUTTAL ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF BALLOT MEASURE L

EXCISE TAX

IMPORTANTLY, those few that argue against this Measure ADMIT that we need these
facilities. Waiting will COST you and I hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Join the City Council’s commitment (by resolution and ballot statement) to
build needed POLICE facilities/downtown City Hall, a Community Center for YOUTH
services and preserve the historic old Martinez Grammar School (currently used
as City Hall). The preservation, of which, will allow its use for cultural and
art purposes.

This tax is FAIR.

Every citizen uses public safety services. Every citizen needs an effective
Police Department. Effective disaster relief is needed by the entire
community. This Measure will enhance the quality of life of every citizen in
our City.

The return on the investment of this tax far exceeds any other fees paid to
government.

Vote for a REASONABLE, FAIR and NEEDED Measure

VOTE YES ON MEASURE L.

REBUTTAL TO PRIMARY ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF BALLOT MEASURE L

Read the Council's argument carefully. Measure L will
provide funding for various projects. It does not contain
any legal requirements as to how that funding will be spent.

*	There is no requirement to provide civic facilities
downtown.

*	There is no firm location or plan for a community center
or its contents.

*	There is no guarantee to preserve the existing City Hall.

The Council asserts that City Hall was "critically damaged"
and "must be repaired to keep it from collapsing". If this
were true then why is the building still in daily use? The
building did suffer some damage that should be repaired, but
isn't California already paying an extra 1/4 V. sales tax to
repair facilities damaged by the earthquake?.

The Council believes we need a community center in part
because most other cities have one. Can we afford to put nuc
money into the hands of public officials without any legal
guarantees just to keep up with the Jones.

In reality, Measure L is little more that a blank check.

It will be spent based on the desires of the new City Council
and the influence of special interest groups.

This measure contains vague promises of items designed to
appeal to as many people as possible. It contains no

guarantees for anyone. There is a right way and a sneaky way

to raise taxes. This appears to be the sneaky way.
PLEASE VOTE NO ON MEASURE L!

PRIMARY ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF BALLOT MEASURE L
EXCISE TAX

Your support of Measure L will allow Martinez to address cost effectively our
public safety and Community Center requirements through the foreseeable future.

A YES vote will provide funding for:

*	Needed public safety and civic facilities downtown

*	Community Center facilities designed to address neighborhood, youth, day
care, and cultural needs of the whole City

*	Preservation and protection of the historic Martinez Grammar School
currently used as City Hall

We depend on City Government to ensure public safety, respond to emergencies
and provide assistance during disasters. However, our Police and City Hall
facilities were critically damaged by the October earthquake. Moreover, these
facilities, particularly with regard to the Police, have long been regarded as
inadequate for reasons of size and condition.

A vote of YES will allow the City to improve its ability to protect its
citizens.

A vote of YES will allow the City to enhance facilities needed to coordinate
emergency services and provide communications capability during disasters.

Martinez is one of the few cities in the County without a Community Center. A
building for TEEN activities and child care as well as a shelter and
communications center in the event of disasters is very important. Measure L
will add these critical facilities to our City.

The earthquake damage to the historic City Hall building must be repaired to
keep it from collapsing. Measure L will preserve and protect this significant
structure for future generations.

*	IMPROVED EMERGENCY AND PUBLIC SAFETY SERVICES

*	A SAFE AND FUNCTIONAL CITY HALL

*	DESIRABLE COMMUNITY CENTER

FOR TEEN, CHILD CARE AND OTHER PROGRAMS

Please join us in voting for Measure L.

who has lived in the same two bedroom home for the last 30
years will be charged the same as a -family living in a new

This tax is planned to pay -for city hall repairs or its
replacement and to bui id a new community center. However,
because it is an excise tax, there is no legal requirement
that the money be spent on any spec i-fie project. The city-
council currently intends to spend the money on these
f ac i 1 i t i es bu t could change their mind. Remember the there
will be a different council after the election who may have
different ideas.

We are forced to conclude that, while the projects which may
be funded by this bond measure might be nice to have, this

It is un-fair.

* -• <

measure is not the right way to fund them.

The money may not be spent as we expect or want.

U)e request that you join us and uote NO on this measure.

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF EXCISE TAX MEASURE

Measure L has as its principal purpose the establishment
of an excise tax to be levied for a maximum of thirty years from
the date of its first imposition. The revenues collected from
imposition of the tax shall be used for the availability and
privilege of use of certain municipal facilities and services, as
well as for other general governmental purposes, described in the
Measure. Measure L identifies the municipal facilities as

(1)	a new community/emergency services center for housing
recreational classes, community events and emergency services
activities (i.e. police facilities) and (2) the refurbishment,
relocation or replacement of City Hall.

If adopted. Measure _L____ would levy a tax not to exceed the

following rates:

Assessee

Tax

1.	As to owners of single-family
residential units

$60.00 per residential
unit per year

2.	As to owners of multi-family
residential units

$44.00 per residential
unit per year

3.	As to owners of apartment units $38.00 per rental unit

per year

4. As to owners of commercial
and other properties

$0.01 per square foot a
parcel (the measure does
not specify whether this
is an annual tax)

All unimproved parcels and all parcels whose County Use
Codes are not those specified in the Measure are exempt from the
tax.

Collection of the tax shall be accomplished by direct,
periodic billing or other appropriate means. The City's
Administrative Services Director is empowered by the Measure to
adopt rules and regulations for the purpose of carrying out and
enforcing the payment, collection and remittance of the tax.
Provisions are included in the Measure covering the procedures
for assessing taxes not paid, as well as for providing for
refunds.

Measure _L____ expressly states that the proceeds of the tax

shall be paid into the City's General Fund. The Measure
estimates the cost of the acquisition, construction and equipping
of the defined municipal facilities to be $10,000,000.00. The
Measure contains an expression of the Council's intent to enter

kl210mo

into a lease whereby the City would pay rental payments from the
General Fund for a period not exceeding thirty years; the lessor
would assign its rights to receive rental payments to a trustee;
and the City and the lessor would authorize the trustee to sell
certificates of participation in the rental payments payable by
the City, the proceeds of which (from the certificates of
participation) would be used to finance the acquisition,
construction and equipping of the defined municipal facilities.

Measure L states that the City proposes to acquire,
construct and equip the municipal facilities, to levy the excise
tax and to enter into said lease for the objects and purposes set
forth therein if a majority of all qualified voters voting on the
measure vote in favor thereof.

PRIMARY ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE L EXCISE TAX

This bond measure is not cuite what it claims to be. It is
not -fair to everyone as was claimed during city council
hearings. It is a tax based on the average occupancy of
different types of dwellings. Single family houses will be
charged $-60 per year. This means a retired senior citizen
who has 1 ived in the same two bedroom home for the last 30
years will be charged the same as a family living in a new
five bedroom executive home. That certainly isn/t fair.

This tax is contrary to the spirit of Proposition 13 which
1 limited property tax increases by requiring 2/3 majority
approval for any new taxes. Because this is an exci.se tax,
it gets around that requirement and only requires a majority
appoval . Typically an excise tax is charged for -the use of
product or service. This "excise” tax will be charged to
re sidences wh ether or not we act ja11y u se the commu i n t y
center ■

This tax is planned to pay for city hall repairs or its
replacement and to build a new community center. However,
because it is an excise tax, there is no legal requirement
that the money be spent on any specific project. The city
council currently intends to spend the money on these
faci1 itiesbut could change their mind. Remember the there
will be a different council after the election who may have
different ideas.

We are forced to conclude that, while the projects which may
be funded by this bond measure might be nice to have, this

measure is not the right way to -fund them.

It is unfair.

The money may not be spent as we expect or want
UJe request that you join us and vote NO on this

measure.
