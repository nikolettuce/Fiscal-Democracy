This measure was placed on the ballot by the City Council of the City of Coalinga. This
measure seeks to amend the City of Coalinga’s prohibition related to marijuana
dispensaries within city limits. This measure, if approved by a majority of the voters, will
enact an ordinance that authorizes a single marijuana dispensary in the City of
Coalinga. The location has not been determined. If a majority of voters approve a single
marijuana dispensary, it would be taxed at the rate of 10% of gross receipts. No other
marijuana dispensaries would be allowed in the City of Coalinga.

Revenues from the tax would be deposited in the City’s general fund which is used to
pay for police and fire protection, senior and youth programs, street repairs, code
enforcement, employee salaries and benefits and other City services. The City of
Coalinga has an overall deficit that exceeds $3,000,000.00.

A “yes” vote on this measure is a vote to approve a single marijuana dispensary in the
City of Coalinga and to approve a tax on that single marijuana dispensary at the rate of
10% of gross receipts. A “no” vote is a vote to reject the establishment and taxing of a
single marijuana dispensary in the City of Coalinga.

Argument In Favor Of Measure_________	FRESNO	COUNTY CLERK

By____________________

DEPI

A marijuana dispensary in the City of Coalinga would help patients who are unable to
grow or acquire marijuana from other sources. The operation of a single dispensary in
the City of Coalinga would provide the City with additional tax revenue. The City of
Coalinga has an overall deficit that exceeds $3,000,000.00.

ARGUMENT AGAINST CITY OF COALINGA MEASURE TO AUTHORIZElANDCLERK

REGULATE A SINGLE MARIJUANA DISPENSARY	RE9nSJx^!l2f:y9TERS

ADMINISTRATION

Vote Against Drug Trafficking Dispensaries in Coalinga

o

UT

The proposed marijuana dispensary will damage our quality of life and strain our law
enforcement resources. As a result of dispensaries in other communities, businesses
and residents have complained of vandalism, increased traffic, trash, public urination,
unwanted foot traffic and drug use in the area of these drug trafficking businesses

Those living near the dispensaries were afraid to walk in their own neighborhoods. We
cannot have drug deals condoned by our own City. What message does that send to
our children? What kind of community will we have if drug use is tolerated?

Growing and distributing marijuana is against federal law. Condoning those activities
locally does not change that fact. Openly permitting the sale of illegal drugs will change
the family nature of the community of Coalinga.

Marijuana use by youth in Fresno County is already on the rise. In a 2014/15 report
there were 1,852 youths seeking treatment for drug addiction. Of these. 69% were
seeking treatment for marijuana addiction.

A permissive City and community attitude toward an illegal drug not only leads to
increased use by youth but has negative workplace impacts as well. Drug use in the
workplace have consequences for employers including safety, employee impairment
and the resulting lost productivity. A permissive culture that makes drugs readily
available negatively impacts the workplace.

Where will a dispensary be located? Next to a school or daycare, a church, your
business or near your home? There is no mention of medical need or compassion, only
the need to earn money from drug trafficking and sales to fund government.

Sheriff Margaret Mims and Supervisor Buddy Mendes are opposed to this measure.
Businesses, neighborhoods and children are at risk, we cannot allow drug trafficking!
Vote against a marijuana dispensary in our City. Vote NO.

Rebuttal Regarding Measure G

©

The Argument Against the City of Coalinga Measure G to Authorize and Regulate a Single Marijuana
Dispensary is, for the most part, not factual and strictly opinion. Marijuana for medical use was made
legal in California, with the adoption of Proposition 215 in 1996. This measure would allow for one
single dispensary within the City to dispense medical marijuana to patients with medical marijuana cards
issued by the State of California through a licensed doctor. This measure relates only to medical use,
not recreational use, as recreational use is not allowed in California. Additionally, the scare tactics used
in the Argument against this measure in relation to the location of the dispensary are false. State law
requires that dispensaries be at least 600 feet from schools, public or private. Vote YES.

The undersigned proponent(s) or author(s) of the rebuttal to the argument against ballot
Measure G at the Presidential General Election for the City of Coalinga to be held on November
8, 2016 hereby state that this argument is true and correct to the best of their knowledge.
