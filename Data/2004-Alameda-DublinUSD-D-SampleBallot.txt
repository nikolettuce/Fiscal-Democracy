Measure D: Parcel Tax, Dublin Joint Unified School District

To maintain existing school programs and improve the quality of education for a growing population; to reduce class sizes and expand the availability of after-school classes and libraries; and to upgrade technology infrastructure and expand student access to computers, shall the Dublin Unified School District levy an annual tax of $180 per parcel for seven years, increasing annually at 2%, with an exemption for parcels owned and occupied by persons 65 years of age and over?

Impartial Analysis from Alameda County Counsel
Measure D, a Dublin Unified School District (the "District") special parcel tax measure, seeks voter approval to authorize the District to levy a special parcel tax annually for seven years for the purpose of funding the programs set forth in the measure.
 A school district, following notice and public hearings, has the authority to levy special taxes upon approval by two thirds (2/3) of the votes cast on the special tax proposal pursuant to Section 4 of Article XIIIA and Article XIIIC of the California Constitution and sections 50075-77, 50079 and 53722 of the California Government Code.
 If approved, these tax funds are proposed to be used by the District to reduce class sizes; extend school library hours for all schools; expand the availability of after-school classes in reading, writing and math; upgrade technology infrastructure and expand student access to computers; provide additional counselors; improve school security; and provide additional textbooks and instructional materials.
 If two-thirds of the qualified electors voting on this measure vote "yes," a qualified special tax at the annual rate of $180.00 per parcel will be imposed, commencing July 1, 2004, for a period of seven years and will increase annually at the rate of two percent (2%). An exemption from the tax would be available annually to property owners who are 65 years or older.
 If less than two-thirds of the qualified electors voting on this measure vote for approval, the measure will fail and the Dublin Unified School District will not be authorized to levy the special tax as proposed by this measure.

Arguments For Measure D
Strong schools are vital to the success of the Dublin community. As our schools continue to progress, recent state budget cuts threaten the quality of education for Dublin's children. Sadly, state funding of public education cannot support and provide for the best possible education.
 Measure D is a local action that we can take together to prevent painful cuts in educational programs due to the state budget crisis. Measure D will insure that Dublin's children receive the highest quality education.
 The facts about Measure D are clear. Funds raised will:
	•	Create after school programs to improve student reading, writing and math skills at all grade levels;
	•	Expand student access to computers bringing the world into the classroom;
	•	Improve current district technology resources;
	•	Increase college prep and Advanced Placement classes for students;
	•	Extend library hours at all schools;
	•	Provide counseling services at elementary and middle schools.
	•	Lower class size at middle and high school grade levels;
	•	Reduce class size in grades 4 and 5 by 25%; 

Measure D will cost property owners less than $3.50 per week + a small cost to pay for improving the quality of education for our youngest citizens. An exemption is available for senior citizens.  Together, we must provide our outstanding teachers, support staff, administrators and parents with the resources needed to continue the high quality educational programs our community expects and our children deserve. Dublin children receive an excellent education despite limited state funding. Our test scores have consistently increased over the past five years. The passage of Measure D will support the continued development of a second-to-none educational system.  Dublin's children deserve the best. Their future is in our hands. The time is now!  Please join us in voting for Dublin's children. Vote YES on Measure D.  s/RANDY SHUMWAY, President,  Board of Trustees, Dublin Unified School District  s/GREG CLARK  Campaign Committee Co-Chairperson  s/JANET LOCKHART  Honorable Mayor, City of Dublin  s/PAM GLYNN  Executive Director, Dublin Partners in Education  s/CATHERINE BROWN, President,  Frederiksen Elementary School Parent-Faculty Club
