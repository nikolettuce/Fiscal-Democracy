The question for Measure S:

To provide funding, that cannot be taken by the State, to
maintain Suisun City services that make neighborhoods safer
including:	rapid	911	emergency	responses, neighborhood

police patrols, youth crime/gang	prevention,	fire

prevention/protection, fixing potholes,	maintaining	City

streets/streetlights, maintaining City parks/street trees, and
other vital City services, shall Suisun City enact a one-cent (1%)
sales tax for ten years, providing $1,800,000 annually, with
annual audits, citizens’ oversight, all funds spent locally in
Suisun City?_____________________________________________________

City Attorney’s Impartial Analysis of Measure S

The Suisun City Council has placed Measure S on the November 8, 2016 ballot to ask the City’s
voters to approve a 1% retail transactions and use (sales) tax for ten years.

Measure S would authorize a general tax and its proceeds would be deposited in the City’s general
fund for general government purposes to be spent as the City Council shall in its discretion, from time to
time, determine. These uses may include, but are not limited to, fire and police, street maintenance and
streetlights, parks, recreational programs, other public services and obligations of the City. City staff
estimates that Measure S would annually raise $1,800,000.

The current 7.625% “sales tax” has three components: the 7.5% statewide sales tax, the 0.125%
Solano County sales tax, and the current 0% City retail transactions and use tax. If Measure S is approved,
the “sales tax” would increase by 1% resulting in a total 8.625% “sales tax.”

With some exceptions, both the sales tax and transactions and use tax are levied on the sale or use of
tangible personal property sold at retail. Retailers collect both at the same time of sale and remit the funds to
the State Board of Equalization, which then remits those funds to the City.

Measure S requires an annual audit by the City’s independent auditor concerning its proceeds in
addition to the regular independent annual audit of the City’s general fund. Measure S establishes a five-
member oversight committee that would review expenditures of tax proceeds.

This type of general tax measure requires voter approval. While the City Council may amend
Measure S’s provisions to clarify the measure’s purpose and intent, the tax rate may only be increased by a
vote of the People at a future election.

A “YES” vote is a vote to approve a 1% retail transactions and use (sales) tax for ten years as
described above. A “NO” vote is a vote against a 1% retail transactions and use (sales) tax as described
above. The transactions and use tax in Measure S would take effect only if it receives a majority “YES”
vote at the November 8,2016 general municipal election and it would last for ten years, unless extended by
a vote of the People at a future election.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure S. If you desire a copy of the ordinance,
please call the Suisun City Clerk’s Office at (707) 421-7302 and a copy will be provided to you at no cost.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF CITY OF SUISUN CITY MEASURE S

Don't believe the chicken in every pot promises by Measure S promoters. The promises are all hot air,
with no guarantees!

They say new taxes are needed to provide police, firefighters, and street maintenance. But
those essential services should be the first priority of Suisun's $22 MILION budget! If
maintaining essential services requires a tax increase, then where is the $22 MILLION going?

There's also no guarantee the new tax will fund essential services. MOST of the council is old.
THIS TAX LASTS FOR TEN YEARS! There is no guarantee how new officials might spend the
money.

Furthermore, Measure H (the road tax) in last June's election was a half percent for five years
tax, while Measure S is double that in percent and years. Measure H couldn't even get a 50%
vote for half the terms! So, why would Suisun voters vote for more waste?

One thing's for sure. Suisun City wouldn't need a tax increase if it brought city salaries and
pensions under control.

When the median income for Suisun is $71,000, why do half of Suisun's employees receive over
$100,000 a year total package?

The budget is crippled by heavy healthcare and pension debts from former employees who no
longer provide public service. Suisun needs to follow other cities that switched from CALPERS
to cheaper retirement plans.

Say NO to wasteful spending and Measure S.

ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE S
SUISUN CITY SALES TAX-GENERAL TAX

Measure S breaks the promise the council and staff made when they pushed to
bring Wal-Mart to Suisun about nine years ago to solve all Suisun's financial
problems. Now with Wal-Mart open about a year, council wants more money.
The vice-mayor admitted at a council meeting that this tax is a hard sell due to
years of assurances to the public that all is well by council members to keep being
re-elected. While most of the council has been in office twenty-two to thirty
years, only downtown has received most of the taxpayer's money and services.
Even worse, under redevelopment, most of the money taken from property taxes,
normally used to maintain the streets and infrastructure, was used to spend on
downtown and the council's developer friends. Furthermore, the City Manager
was hired to spend ninety-five percent of her time on redevelopment. Yet,
redevelopment ended over three years ago and she still has a job. She should be
terminated! The current Police Chief beat up a senior citizen falsely accused of
assault in front of TV news cameras and the Chief, former Chief (who is now
Police Chief, Bell, Ca), Mayor, and Council are all now in Federal Court wasting
your money over this. After thirty years, council still hasn't maintained existing
roads and infrastructure. Why should we trust them with more money? This is a
regressive tax, hurting the poor more, and can be spent on anything. If council
wants a sales tax, it should be a specific tax requiring a two-thirds vote. That way,
it is harder to waste the money. Don't make Suisun like the county, Michael
Johnson = $388,400/year retirement!

YES ON MEASURE S.

VITAL SERVICES FOR SUISUN CITY.

Measure S ensures Suisun City will not lose police officers or see reduced neighborhood police
patrols.

Measure S protects and strengthens Suisun City's most vital services. It protects your property
values.

Measure S bolsters:

*	Neighborhood Police Patrols throughout Suisun City

*	Youth Crime Prevention programs

*	Suisun City's Police Department - keeping our qualified and experienced officers

*	Emergency 911 by slashing response times by our first responders

With Measure S, Suisun City will stay a great place to live, raise a family, retire, own a business
- or just plain visit.

Suisun City is a great hometown. But it hasn't always been.

Once, Suisun City was the last place you'd want to raise a family. It had empty storefronts,
dilapidated buildings. The old Crescent neighborhood was where drugs were sold openly in
front of our children. It wasn't nice.

Suisun City was voted the Worst City in the Bay Area.

That was in 1988.

Then, a group of Suisun City leaders began meeting and planning how to turn Suisun City
around.

They created Suisun City's Blueprint Plan - showing what Suisun City could be - if we worked
together.

The results are seen today. A safer Suisun City. A hidden gem.

Measure S ensures Suisun City stays this way.

The Suisun City we live in today is unrecognizable from its former self. That's how much change
occurred since 1988.

But, Suisun City's way of life is threatened.

Suisun City's financial situation is serious. Stemming from the brutal economic recession and
funding that State government stripped from cities. Suisun City is one of hundreds of cities that
face enormous pressures.

Because Measure S resources cannot be taken by the State, Suisun City keeps its most vital
services - those that keep our families safe and our neighborhood protected.

Please join hundreds and hundreds of Suisun City's community, neighborhood and business
leaders.

Vote Yes on Measure S. Keep Suisun City Safe.

Rebuttal to Argument Against Measure S
Sunday, August 28,2016

Word Count: 248/250

Measure S keeps our tax dollars right here in Suisun City, where they do the most work for all of us.

Measure S ensures funding for neighborhood police patrols, quicker response from 911, fire department
resources, street and sidewalk maintenance, youth and senior programs and keeping streetlights on.

All for just a penny on the dollar.

Plus, Measure S will prevent the state from taking our dedicated portion of the sales tax, giving us the
same protections as Vacaville, Benicia and Fairfield.

Suisun City is a good community getting better. And we do it with a lot less money than our neighbors.
Fairfield takes in $1,576 per person in tax revenue, while Suisun City has gotten by on just $652. Suisun
City residents don't pay a utility tax like most cities, and we have the lowest sales tax rate in Solano
County.

All cities have been hurt by a long recession and Sacramento taking local tax revenue for state programs;
Suisun City is no exception. Even though revenue was cut, we still need money for police, safe streets
and community programs.

If Measure S passes, the state won't be able to take our money, and we'll have the resources we need to
protect ourselves.

It allows us to control the destiny of our community.

Measure S is a straightforward plan for Suisun City to protect, improve and guarantee important public
safety, youth and senior programs with money that can't be taken away from us.

Vote Yes on Measure S to Keep Suisun City Moving Forward.

NOW THEREFORE, on the basis of the foregoing, the People of the City of Suisun
City at the November 8, 2016, general municipal election do hereby Ordain as follows:

SECTION 1. A new Chapter 3.14 is hereby added to the Suisun City Code to read as
follows:

Chapter 3.14
GENERAL TRANSACTIONS AND USE TAX

3.14.010 Title of ordinance. This Chapter shall be known as the General
Transactions and Use Tax Ordinance. This Chapter shall be applicable only in the
incorporated territory of the City.

3.14.020 Basic definitions. As used in this Chapter, "City" means the City of Suisun
City and "tax" means the transactions and use tax (general tax) imposed under the provisions
of this Chapter.

3.14.030 Operative date. "Operative Date" means the first day that the tax is
imposed. The “operative date” means the first day of the first calendar quarter commencing
more than 110 days after the effective date of this Chapter, such effective date being as set
forth below, and shall expire ten years thereafter.

3.14.040 Purpose. This Chapter is adopted to achieve the following, among other
purposes, and directs that the provisions hereof be interpreted in order to accomplish those
purposes:

A.	To impose a retail transactions and use tax in accordance with the provisions of

and Section 7285.9 of Part 1.7 of Division 2, which authorizes the City to adopt this tax
ordinance which shall be operative only if a majority of the electors voting on the measure
vote to approve the imposition of the tax at an election called for that purpose.

B.	To adopt a retail transactions and use tax (general tax) ordinance that
incorporates provisions identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the State of
California insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and
limitations contained in Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.

C.	To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that imposes a general tax
and provides a measure therefore that may be administered and collected by the State Board
of Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as practicable to, and requires the least
possible deviation from, the existing statutory and administrative procedures followed by the
State Board of Equalization in administering and collecting the California State Sales and Use
Taxes.

D.	To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that may be administered
in a manner that will be, to the greatest degree possible, consistent with the provisions of Part
1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting the
transactions and use taxes, and at the same time, minimize the burden of record keeping upon
persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this ordinance.

3.14.050 Contract with state. Prior to the operative date, the City shall contract with
the State Board of Equalization to perform all functions incident to the administration and
operation of this transactions and use tax ordinance; provided however, that if the City shall
not have contracted with the State Board of Equalization prior to the operative date, it shall
nevertheless so contract and in such a case the operative date shall be the first day of the first
calendar quarter following the execution of such a contract.

3.14.060 Transaction tax rate. For the privilege of selling tangible personal property
at retail, a tax is hereby imposed upon all retailers in the incorporated territory of the City at
the rate of one-cent per dollar (1.0%) of the gross receipts of any retailer from the sale of all
tangible personal property sold at retail in said territory on and after the operative date of this
Chapter.

3.14.070 Place of sale. For the purposes of this Chapter, all retail sales are
consummated at the place of business of the retailer unless the tangible personal property sold
is delivered by the retailer or his agent to an out-of-state destination or to a common carrier
for delivery to an out-of-state destination. The gross receipts from such sales shall include
delivery charges, when such charges are subject to the State sales and use tax, regardless of
the place to which delivery is made. In the event a retailer has no permanent place of business
in the State or has more than one place of business, the place or places at which the retail sales
are consummated shall be determined under rules and regulations to be prescribed and
adopted by the State Board of Equalization.

3.14.080 Use tax rate. An excise tax is hereby imposed on the storage, use or other
consumption in the City of tangible personal property purchased from any retailer on and after
the operative date of this Chapter for storage, use or other consumption in said territory at the
rate of one-cent per dollar (1.0%) of the sales price of the property. The sales price shall

include delivery charges when such charges are subject to State sales or use tax regardless of

3.14.090 Proceeds of taxes. The proceeds of the transactions and use tax imposed by
this Chapter shall be deposited into the General Fund of the City to be used for all general
government purposes which may include, but are not limited to, fire and police protection,
street and sidewalk repair and maintenance, park repair and maintenance, recreational
programs, building and code enforcement services, planning and zoning services, capital
equipment requirements, public infrastructure, repair and replacement of City facilities,
capital improvement projects, operational expenses, fiduciary responsibilities, administration,
indebtedness, and general obligations of the City. The tax imposed by this Chapter is
intended to be and is, a general tax, the proceeds of which are to be spent as the City Council
shall in its discretion, from time to time, determine.

3.14.100 Adoption of provisions of state law. Except as otherwise provided in this
Chapter and except insofar as they are inconsistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of Division
2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, all of the provisions of Part 1 (commencing with
Section 6001) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code are hereby adopted and made
a part of this Chapter as though fully set forth herein.

3.14.110 Limitations on adoption of state law and collection of use taxes. In
adopting the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code:

A.	Wherever the State of California is named or referred to as the taxing agency,
the name of the City shall be substituted therefore. However, the substitution shall not be
made when:

1.	The word "State" is used as a part of the title of the State Controller,
State Treasurer, State Board of Control, State Board of Equalization, State Treasury, or the
Constitution of the State of California.

2.	The result of that substitution would require action to be taken by or
against this City or any agency, officer, or employee thereof rather than by or against the State
Board of Equalization, in performing the functions incident to the administration or operation
of this Chapter.

3.	In those sections, including, but not necessarily limited to, sections
referring to the exterior boundaries of the State of California, where the result of the
substitution would be to:

a.	Provide an exemption from this tax with respect to certain sales,
storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property, which would not otherwise
be exempt from this tax while such sales, storage, use or other consumption remain subject to
tax by the State under the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation
Code, or

b.	Impose this tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use or
other consumption of tangible personal property, which would not be subject to tax by the
State under the said provision of that code.

Section 6067 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, an additional transactor's permit shall not be
required by this Chapter.
