IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY WOODLAKE CITY COUNSEL
MEASURE R

PROPOSED ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF
WOODLAKE ENACTING A ONE PERCENT (1% OR
ONE PENNY PER DOLLAR) GENERAL SALES TAX.

Upon voter approval, section 7285.9 of the Revenue and
Taxation Code authorizes a city to levy a general
purpose retail transactions and use tax (“sales tax”) on
tangible personal property. In order for the sales tax to be
approved, a majority vote of the qualified voters of the
city voting on this measure must vote in favor of the
measure.

If this measure is approved, Ordinance No. 609 of the
City of Woodlake (“City”) will be implemented, imposing a
transactions and use tax upon all retailers within the
incorporated territory of the City at the rate of one percent
(1% or one penny per dollar). The authority to levy the
tax will be effective until repealed by a duly enacted
ordinance. However, the City Council would have
authority to temporarily suspend collection of the tax by
resolution unanimously approved by all members of the
entire City Council.

The revenues derived from the sales tax must be placed
in the City's General Fund and may be used for any
general city purpose, including but not limited to
maintaining and/or improving: 9-1-1 emergency response
and neighborhood police patrols; streets and roads
repairs; support of senior and youth services; city parks;
recreation facilities and programs; and any other city
services for Woodlake residents.

If this measure is approved, the ordinance will become
operative but the retail transactions and use tax cannot
be levied earlier than first day of the first calendar quarter
commencing more than one hundred ten (110) days after
the adoption of the ordinance by the voters.

All amendments subsequent to voter approval to Part 1
of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code relating
to sales and use taxes and which are not inconsistent
with Part 1.6 and Part 1.7 of Division 2 of the Revenue
and Taxation Code, and all amendments to Part 1.6 and
Part 1.7 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code,
shall automatically become a part of the ordinance
implementing this measure. The proposed ordinance
contains certain exemptions and exclusions from the
computation of the amount of the transactions and use
tax on certain transactions, including those exemptions
already applicable under state law.

This measure was added to the ballot by the City Council
and makes no change to existing laws but will add to
existing laws a citywide ordinance imposing the
aforementioned transactions and use tax within the City
of Woodlake. The electors entitled to vote on this
measure are the registered voters residing within City of
Woodlake. If the measure is not approved by a majority
vote of the votes cast on the measure, the measure will
fail and the tax will not be imposed.

_____CITY	OF	WOODLAKE_____

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE R

CIUDAD DE WOODLAKE
ARGUMENTO A FAVOR DE LA MEDIDA R

We support ballot Measure R to raise the City of
Woodlake’s sales tax by 1 %.

Woodlake has less to spend on police, public safety,
and parks and recreation than any other city in Tulare
County. The demand for services continues to rise,
but limited revenues haven’t allowed the City to
improve those services. Woodlake has been able to
maintain a minimum level of services by cutting
expenses, however, the demand for public safety,
police, and parks and recreation has increased faster
than Woodlake’s budget. Measure R will help us keep
up with the growing demand for these services.

Measure R will ensure that tax dollars raised in
Woodlake will be used by the city to deal with our
local needs. Measure R will ensure that all people
that use our local services contribute to the sales tax,
not just the citizens of Woodlake. Basic necessities
like groceries and prescription medications won't be
taxed. Visitors to Woodlake will pay their fair share, so
residents won't shoulder the entire cost.

Measure R will also ensure that revenues are spent
wisely. Each year the City will be required to undergo
an audit to make sure that the funds are being
properly spent. The City will also establish a citizens’
advisory committee that will oversee the expenditures
and make recommendations on how the funds should
be spent.

Woodlake is our home! Let's all work together to
support our City and our Community.

We ask you to vote YES on Measure R on November
7, 2017.

Mayor, City of Woodlake

NO ARGUMENT AGAINST THIS MEASURE WAS
SUBMITTED

Apoyamos la medida R en la boleta electoral para
aumentar un 1% el impuesto sobre las ventas de la
ciudad de Woodlake.

Woodlake cuenta con menos dinero que cualquier otra
ciudad en el condado de Tulare para gastar en policia,
seguridad publica, y parques y recreacion. La demanda
de servicios sigue aumentando, pero los ingresos
limitados no han permitido que la ciudad mejore esos
servicios. Woodlake ha podido mantener un nivel minimo
de servicios gracias al recorte de gastos; sin embargo, la
demanda de seguridad publica, policia, y parques y
recreacibn ha aumentado mbs rbpido que el presupuesto
de Woodlake. La medida R nos ayudara a mantener el
ritmo de la creciente demanda de estos servicios.

La medida R garantizara que la ciudad use los impuestos
recaudados en Woodlake para satisfacer nuestras
necesidades locales. La medida R garantizara que todas
las personas que usen nuestros servicios locales
contribuyan al impuesto sobre las ventas, no solamente
los ciudadanos de Woodlake. Las necesidades basicas,
como alimentos y medicamentos recetados, no pagaran
impuestos. Los visitantes de Woodlake pagaran su parte
correspondiente, por lo que los residentes no asumiran el
costo total.

La medida R tambibn garantizarb que los ingresos se
utilicen de manera adecuada. Cada afio, se exigira que la
ciudad se someta a una auditoria para garantizar que los
fondos se utilicen correctamente. La ciudad tambibn
establecera un comite asesor ciudadano que supervisara
los gastos y hara recomendaciones sobre como deben
utilizarse los fondos.

jWoodlake es nuestro hogar! Trabajemos juntos para
apoyar a nuestra ciudad y a nuestra comunidad.

MEASURE S

PROPOSED ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF
WOODLAKE ENACTING A COMMERCIAL CANNABIS
BUSINESS TAX.

In November 2016, California voters approved
Proposition 64 which, among other things, decriminalized
the use, sale and cultivation of non-medicinal cannabis
by adults and set a maximum cultivation allowance for
non-medicinal cannabis. Proposition 64 also authorized
local control over land uses involving non-medicinal
cannabis. The City anticipates enactment of zoning
standards and regulations, which would govern those
types of land uses, prior to January 1, 2018.

Upon voter approval of Measure S, Ordinance No. 610
would authorize the City of Woodlake (“City”) to levy an
excise tax on the privilege of conducting a commercial
cannabis business within the City. In order for the tax to
be approved, a majority vote of the qualified voters of the
City voting on this measure must vote in favor of the
measure.

Measure S would impose a business tax on every person
engaged in a commercial cannabis business within the
City, without regard to whether it is medicinal or non-
medicinal cannabis. The maximum tax rate would not
exceed the greater of either: (i) $25.00 per square foot of
business areas, annually adjusted upward based upon
the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”) for all urban
consumers in the San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose
areas; or (ii) 10% of gross receipts per fiscal year. The
City Council would be authorized to adopt a resolution
implementing a tax rate which is lower than the maximum
tax rate.

Measure S is a general tax under state law and, if
enacted by the voters, the revenues received from the
tax must be placed in the City’s general fund and may be
used for any lawful purpose, as directed by the City
Council, including but not limited to addressing cannabis
industry impacts and/or maintaining and/or improving: 9-
1-1 emergency response and neighborhood police
patrols; streets and roads repairs; support of senior and
youth services; city parks; recreation programs; and any
other city services for Woodlake residents.

If this measure is approved by the voters, Ordinance No.
610 shall be adopted by the City Council on the date the
City Council declares the election results. The ordinance
will become effective (10) ten days thereafter but the tax
shall not be levied until the City Council has adopted a
resolution setting an effective tax rate and implementing
the tax.

_____CITY	OF	WOODLAKE_____

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE S

_____CIUDAD	DE	WOODLAKE____

ARGUMENTO A FAVOR DE LA MEDIDA S

Measure S will allow the City of Woodlake to impose a
tax on medical and recreational cannabis businesses
operating within the City now that California voters
have approved Proposition 64, the Adult Use of
Marijuana Act. Measure S will ensure that the City has
the resources to properly support and regulate the
cannabis industry without hurting our investment in
city services, such as maintaining general services
and public safety.

Over 40 Cities and Counties in California have already
enacted similar taxes for cannabis businesses to
address the potential strain on the local agencies’
budgets caused by cannabis legalization.

Measure S is fiscally responsible, timely, and prudent.
Over the past few years, the City of Woodlake has
addressed the aging downtown infrastructure,
provided new recreational facilities, and has made key
investments from a limited pool of resources. By
proactively establishing a tax on cannabis activity, the
City’s budget will be protected from any new or
unexpected costs associated with cannabis
legalization and permitting, and provide additional
resources for investment in other key priorities.

Measure S was carefully crafted with input from public
safety employees, residents, and business owners in
a public forum to find the right balance between
generating the revenue needed while addressing
public concerns for this emerging industry. Adoption of
a clear, fair, and easy to follow legal framework will
encourage cannabis businesses to join the regulated
market, ensuring protection for consumers, the
environment, and public health.

We respectfully request a Yes vote on Measure S.

NO ARGUMENT AGAINST THIS MEASURE WAS
SUBMITTED

La medida S permitira a la ciudad de Woodlake gravar un
impuesto sobre los negocios de cannabis con fines
medicos y recreativos que operen dentro de la ciudad,
ahora que los votantes de California aprobaron la
Propuesta 64, la Ley sobre el Consumo de Marihuana
para Adultos. La medida S garantizara que la ciudad
cuente con los recursos para apoyar y regular de manera
adecuada la industria del cannabis sin dafiar nuestra
inversion en los servicios de la ciudad, como mantener los
servicios generales y la seguridad publica.

Mas de 40 ciudades y condados de California ya han
promulgado impuestos similares para negocios de
cannabis, con el fin de enfrentar la posible tension de los
presupuestos de las agendas locales que podria causar
la legalizacion del cannabis.

La medida S es fiscalmente responsable, oportuna y
prudente. En los ultimos anos, la ciudad de Woodlake ha
abordado el problema de la obsoleta infraestructura del
centra, ha proporcionado nuevas instalaciones recreativas
y ha hecho inversiones clave con un fondo de recursos
limitado. Al establecer de manera proactiva un impuesto
sobre los negocios de cannabis, el presupuesto de la
ciudad estara protegido de cualquier costo nuevo o
inesperado relacionado con la legalizacion y autorizacion
del cannabis, y brindara recursos adicionales para invertir
en otras prioridades clave.

La medida S se elaboro cuidadosamente a partir de los
comentarios de empleados de seguridad publica,
residentes y empresarios durante un foro publico, para
encontrar el equilibrio adecuado entre generar los
ingresos que se necesitan y abordar las inquietudes
publicas sobre esta industria emergente. La adopcion de
un marco legal claro, justo y facil de respetar exhortara a
que los comerciantes de cannabis se adhieran al mercado
regulado, para garantizar la protection de los
consumidores, el medio ambiente y la salud publica.

3.18.030 - Tax Authorization

A cannabis industry tax is hereby imposed on every person who is engaged in cannabis
business in the City as prescribed herein, from and after the effective date of a City Council
resolution implementing the tax. It is unlawful for any person to transact or carry on any
cannabis business in the City without paying, in accordance with this Chapter, the cannabis
industry tax imposed by this section.

A.	Tax on Commercial Cannabis Businesses

1.	There is hereby imposed on every person engaged in commercial cannabis
business in the City, an annual tax at a rate established by resolution of the City
Council which rate shall not exceed twenty-five U.S. dollars ($25 USD) per square
foot of cannabis business area or ten percent (10%) of annual gross receipts. The
maximum square foot tax shall be adjusted annually each January 1st based on the
year-over-year percentage change in Bureau of Labor Statistics San
Francisco/Oakland/San Jose Consumer Price Index - All Urban Consumers (CPI-
U) October to October comparison, or if such index is discontinued, a comparable
successor consumer price index as determined by the City Council. The tax
imposed under this Subsection (A)(1) shall be due and payable in installments as
provided in Section 3.18.040 of this Chapter. The tax imposed under this
Subsection (A)(1) shall not be implemented unless and until the City Council acts
by resolution to do so.

2.	The taxable square footage calculation shall be determined by including all
portions of the premises where the commercial cannabis business operates
deducting therefrom driveways, sidewalks, landscaping, vacant unused space,
areas used exclusively for office space, employee break rooms, restrooms, and
storage space unrelated to the commercial cannabis business (such as a janitorial
closet).

3.	If more than one cannabis business operates on the premises, each licensee shall
be responsible for paying the tax.

4.	The City Council may by resolution, in its discretion, implement an effective tax
rate which is lower than the maximum authorized rates set forth in Subsection
(A)(1) for all persons engaged in a cannabis business in the City or establish
differing tax rates for different categories of commercial cannabis business or
tiered tax rates based on the cannabis business area . For example, and without
limitation, the City Council may set different effective tax rates for cannabis
cultivation for medical or non-medical cannabis, or for indoor rather than mixed
light cultivation. For example, and without limitation, the City Council may set
different effective rates for each license including manufacturers, processors,
distributors, transporters, testing facilities or dispensaries. The City Council may,
by resolution, also decrease or increase any such effective tax rate from time to
time, provided that the effective tax rate shall not, at any time, exceed the
maximum tax rates authorized in Subsection (A)(1). The City may also establish,
by resolution, a tiered rate which establishes different effective rates which will
increase or decrease based upon the cannabis business area. An affirmative vote
of the City Council is required for any tax increase resulting in a tax rate of over
5% whenever the effective rate is already set at or below 5%. Tax rates shall be
set for a minimum of a one (1) fiscal year term and, unless otherwise provided by
the resolution setting the rate, shall remain in effect from year to year until further
action by the City Council.

5.	Persons subject to the tax imposed by Subsections (A)(1) and (A)(2) shall also
register and pay all fees required by the City Council.

s

C. No further voter approval shall be required for the adoption or increase of a tax under
the authority granted by this Section 3.18.030 of this Chapter, it being the intent of the
People of the City of Woodlake to authorize such a tax up to and including the maximum
rates set forth above whenever implemented by the City Council hereafter.

The cannabis industry tax imposed by this Chapter shall be due and payable as follows:

A.	Each person subject to tax under this chapter, except a cannabis tax based on a square

calendar quarter, prepare and submit a tax return and remit to the Collector the tax due
for that quarter. At the time the return is filed, the Ml amount of the tax due for the
prior quarter shall be remitted to the Collector. At any time, a business may apply in
writing to the Collector to have these tax returns and payments made less frequently or
on a different schedule. Any determination resulting from this application will be at the
sole discretion of the Collector and shall be provided in writing.

B.	Each person subject to a cannabis tax based upon square footage shall, on or before the
last day of the month following the close of each calendar quarter, prepare and submit
a tax return and remit to the Collector the tax due for that quarter. The tax shall be
calculated in accordance with rules and regulations established by the Collector
pursuant to 3.18.120. The tax return may include a request for adjustment of the tax
due to crop loss or periods without cultivation, along with evidence substantiating the
crop loss or fallow periods. If the cultivation begins significantly after January 1 or
terminates significantly before December 31 of the calendar year, a request to prorate
the tax may be submitted with clear and convincing evidence supporting the timing of
the cultivation. The decision to prorate or adjust the tax will be made at the sole
discretion of the Collector. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax
due for the prior quarter shall be remitted to the Collector. At any time, a business may
apply in writing to the Collector to have these tax returns and payments made less
frequently or on a different schedule. Any determination resulting from this
application will be at the sole discretion of the Collector and shall be provided in
writing.

C.	All tax returns shall be completed on forms prescribed by the Collector.

D.	Tax returns and payments for all outstanding taxes owed to the City under this
Chapter are immediately due and payable to the City of Woodlake upon cessation of

City holiday, the due date shall be the next regular business day on which the City is open

to the public.

3.18.060 Payment - When Taxes Deemed Delinquent.

Unless otherwise specifically provided under other provisions of this Chapter, the taxes

6

required to be paid pursuant to this Chapter shall be deemed delinquent if not received by
the City of Woodlake on or before the due date as specified in Section 3.18.040

3.18.070 Notice Not Required by City.

The City of Woodlake is not required to send a delinquency or other notice or bill to any
person subject to this Chapter. Failure to send such notice or bill shall not affect the
validity of any tax or penalty or interest due under this Chapter.

3.18.080 Waiver of Penalties.

The Collector may waive the penalties imposed upon any person if:

A.	The person provides evidence satisfactory to the Collector that failure to pay timely
was due to circumstances beyond the control of the person and occurred
notwithstanding the exercise of ordinary care and the absence of willful neglect, and
the person paid the delinquent cannabis industry tax and accrued interest owed the
City before applying to the Collector for a waiver.

B.	The waiver provisions specified in this subsection shall be granted only once during
any twenty-four (24) month period.

of the provisions of this Chapter.

3.18.130 Apportionment.

If a cannabis business subject to a cannabis industry tax is operating both within and
outside the City, it is the intent of the City to apply the cannabis industry tax so that the

7

measure of the tax fairly reflects the proportion of the taxed activity actually carried on
within the City.

3.18.140 Construction.

A. This tax is intended to be applied in a manner consistent with the United States and
California Constitutions, State and local law. None of the tax provided for by this
Chapter shall be applied in a manner that causes an undue burden upon interstate

Constitutions of the United States or the State of California or a violation of any other
provision of the California Constitution, State or local law.

3.18.150 Audit and Examination of Records and Equipment.

person engaged in cannabis business in the City, including both State and federal
income tax returns, California sales tax returns, or other evidence documenting the
gross receipts of persons engaged in cannabis business, and, where necessary, all
equipment of any person engaged in cannabis business in the City, for the purpose of
ascertaining the amount of cannabis industry tax, if any, required to be paid under this
Chapter, and for the purpose of verifying any statements or any item thereof when
filed by any person pursuant to this Chapter. If such person, after written demand by
the Collector, refuses to make available for audit, examination or verification such
books, records or equipment as the Collector requests, the Collector may, after full
consideration of all information within his or her knowledge concerning the cannabis
business and activities of the person so refusing, make an assessment against the
cannabis business of the taxes estimated to be due under this Chapter.

B.	It shall be the duty of every person liable for the collection and payment to the City
of any tax imposed by this Chapter to keep and preserve, for a period of at least five
(5) years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax as he
or she may have been liable for the collection of and payment to the City, which
records the Collector shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times.

right and authority to amend or repeal the ordinance, or amend it in any lawful manner
which does not result in an increase in the maximum rate of the tax or broaden the scope of
the tax imposed herein, without further voter approval. If the City Council repeals any
provision of this chapter, it may subsequently reenact it without voter approval, as long as
the reenacted provision does not result in an increase in the maximum rate of the tax or
broaden the scope of the tax imposed herein.

can be transferred unless and until an amount equal to the estimated taxes projected
by the Collector to be owed under this Chapter at the close of the quarter following
the consummation of transfer, is actually deposited in-full with the City. Upon
consummation of the transfer, any overpayment may be claimed through a timely
and appropriate refund as authorized within this Chapter.

3.18.190 Payment of Tax Does Not Authorize Unlawful Business.

shall not entitle any person to engage in any cannabis business unless the person
has complied with all of the requirements of this Code and all other applicable
State or local laws.

continuance of any illegal or unlawful business, or any business in violation of
