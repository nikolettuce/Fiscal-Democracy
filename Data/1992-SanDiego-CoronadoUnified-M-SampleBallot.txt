Proposition M

M Shall approval be given to (1) the levy of a special parcel tax by Ihe
Coronado Unified School District in the amount of One Hundred
($100.00) dollars per parcel beginning June 2,1992, to hire additional
teachers and expand Instructional programs and services, provided no tax
shall be imposed on a parcel owned by a person age 65 or older upon
submission of a completed application for exemption, and (2) an increase
in the appropriation limit of the amount equal to the proceeds of this tax
in order to make the proceeds available to the District to hire additional
teachers and expand instructional programs and services?

COUNTY COUNSEL IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

The Coronado Unified School District is proposing a levy of a qualified special tax of a flat
amount of $100.00 (one hundred dollars) per year for each parcel of real property within the
District. This proposition, however, provides for an exemption from such taxes for a parcel owned
by a person age 65 or older upon submission of a completed application for exemption. This
special tax and the exemption are authorized by California Government Code section 50079. The
California Conslitution requires a 2/3rds vote of approval of the qualified electors voting at the
election to levy and collect the parcel tax. The revenues from the parcel tax will be used to hire
additional teachers and expand instructional programs and services.

In order to use the revenues collected from the parcel tax levy, the Coronado Unified School
District also is proposing the necessary increase in the annual appropriations limit for the District
in an amount equal to the amount of the special parcel tax levy. The California Constitution permits
changes in the annual appropriations limit for a four year period if approved by a majority vote of
the qualified electors voting at the election.

A “yes" vote Is a vote in favor of levying the flat amount of SI 00.00 (one hundred dollars) per
year for each parcel of real property within the School District, except parcels owned by a person
age 65 or older who submits a completed application for exemption, for the purpose of hiring
additional teachers and expanding Instructional programs and services.

A “no" vote is a vote not to levy the flat amount of $100.00 (one hundred dollars) per year for
each parcel (except as exempted for owners 65 or older) for hiring teachers and expanding
instructional programs and services and not to increase the appropriation limit.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION M

Coronado schools have a long history of high achievement by students, reasonable class size,
excellent teachers and substantial variety in curricular offerings. Annually in standardized test
comparisons Coronado schools rank In the top 5% of State and county schools.

In recent years the level of State support for schools has declined substantially resulting in
reduction in programs and a rise in the size of classes at all levels.

The school district is no longer able to support the same quality level of programs and personnel
under the current funding levels. It has been necessary to reduce staff each of the past two years.

The building program now in effect utilizes local tax funds, which may be used only for buildings
and equipment. These funds are not available for program purposes. Thus, the Board of Education
is able to provide excellent new buildings without increasing local taxes but cannot continue the
customary high-quality programs because of circumstances controlled completely by the State
Legislature.

Passage of the parcel tax will permit restoration of academic and extra-curricular programs
previously reduced and the rehiring of quality staff members and the reduction of class size sorely
needed to continue the schools’ recognized high standing among county and State schools.

REBUTTAL TO THE ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION M

Why do you suppose the local tax funds can only be used for buildings and equipment? Didn’t the
politicians who made this law realize they'd need money for staff?

First they got a tax for buildings. Now they want a tax for staff. What's next? A tax for operating
expenses?

That’s a problem with politically controlled education. They don’t plan far enough ahead. Should
you have to pay extra for poor planning by the politicians?

Some would blame the State Legislature. There's another problem with government education. It's
run by the government, by departments and bureaucracies and politicians all lighting for a slice
of the pie.

Where does this leave our children? Why should they be entangled in the uncertainties of politics?
Wouldn’t you rather keep control of the quality of their education?

Perpetual tax Increases are not the way to go. The government should take the money they spend
on education and give it to you, in the form of an education voucher, which you would be free to
spend at the school of your choice.

If you still wanted to send your child to the government-run school, you could. If you realize a
private school can do the job better and cheaper, you could send your child there.

Are you under-taxed? Do you think this is the last time they will ask for a tax increase?

It’s time to put a stop to the endless spiral of taxing and spending. Vote NO on Proposition M.

ARGUMENT AGAINST PROPOSITION M

The government spends about $5000 per student per vet- on public schools. For $5000 per year
you can send your child to a lop-notch private elementary schooll The politicians are asking you
to pay for premium quality education. Is that what you’re getting?

Now they say $5000 per year still isn't enough. Now they want another $100 per parcel. Renters
will pay too.

As if that weren’t enough, the politicians are trying to “divide and conquer". They figure if they only
tax some of the voters, the rest of the voters will happily vote yes, having nothing to lose!

But as long as we let them split us up into groups and pit us against each other, we all lose!

This tax increase is unnecessary. If they can't do the job for $5000 per student per year, there's
something desperately wrong. How long will they keep coming to us for more tax money?

You and I have to live on a budget. If we can’t afford everything we want, we have to figure out a
way to do more with less. Why should politicians just keep taxing and spending? They should
figure out an alternative.

There are alternatives. Government schools have five times as many non-teaching personnel as
private schools. They should reduce this overhead before raising taxes any higher. But the
politicians won't do it.

What wil] the politicians do? They’ll just keep raising your taxes, over and over again, higher and
higher, until you say you've had enough!

Property taxes go up. Sales taxes go up. Income tax goes up. Then property taxes go up again!

They don't need any more of your money. They're already getting as much as better private
schools get.

Vote NO on vet another tax increase. Vote NO on Proposition M.

REBUTTAL TO THE ARGUMENT AGAINST PROPOSITION M

The argument against Proposition M presents information that is not correct for Coronado
Schools.

Coronado receives about $3,467 per student per year from State and local taxes. We are also
fortunate enough to receive funding for Federally connected students (military families), which
provides an additional $341 per student for all students. For this, Coronado has enjoyed a public
school system that has been ranked as one of the top in the county, while being administered at
the second lowest cost of all 66 California school districts of similar size.

So, rather than arguing about the facts surrounding problems elsewhere, let us concentrate on
what will meet the needs of Coronado's children. Their most fundamental need is to retain good
teachers with reasonable class size for the wide variety of enhanced subjects we offer. This is what
will serve our children and their future.

Because our sources of revenue are becoming more limited and we cannot continue offering our
customarily high quality of education, we, the citizens of Coronado, have been asked to tax
ourselves another $100 per year as our contribution toward continued quality education. Vote YES
for our most precious resource for the future. Vote YES on Proposition M.

POLL WORKERS AND FACILITIES NEEDED
MEET YOUR NEIGHBORS!

SERVE YOUR COMMUNITY!

There is a shortage of poll workers in many San Diego County
neighborhoods. Voters who are interested in this important work are
encouraged to apply by completing the application form. If you
apply immediately, it is possible that you could be assigned to work
at a polling place in the next election.

The Registrar is trying to build a permanent corps of poll workers;
therefore, homemakers and retired people, as well as others who
are interested in community service are particularly urged to apply.
The department also pays for the use of facilities to be used as a
polling place; i.e., home, clubhouse, business. Since the county
continues to grow and population centers shift, new polling places
are constantly needed.

You will receive a fee for your services.

Once this application is received you will be contacted by the
Registrar of Voters Office.
