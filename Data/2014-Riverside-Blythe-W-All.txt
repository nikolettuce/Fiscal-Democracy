IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE “W”

As declared and reaffirmed by the Blythe City Council, the City
continues to face a state of fiscal emergency due to the severe impact of
the economic collapse caused by the Great Recession of recent years,
as well as the collapse of the housing market, continuing California
state takeaways, and insufficient tax revenues to cover government
expenses. In response to this fiscal emergency, the City Council is
asking the City’s voters to vote on Measure “W.”

If approved by the voters, Measure “W” would increase the City’s sales
tax, currently set at 8%, by '/2 of 1% for a period of five years. At this
new rate, a transaction amounting to $100 would generate an additional
$.50 cents in City revenue in addition to the $8 currently collected. Like
the 8% sales tax currently being collected, the proposed increase
would be imposed upon the sale of tangible personal property sold at
retail within the City.

All proceeds of the tax will be deposited into the City’s General Fund
to be used for all general municipal governmental purposes at the
City’s discretion, such as for public safety services, street and sidewalk
repairs, upkeep and development of the City’s parks, water delivery and
treatment, and other local governmental functions.

This measure provides that the Vi of 1% sales tax increase would expire
in five years.

Measure “W” was placed on the Ballot by the Blythe City Council. It
will be adopted if it is approved by a majority of the voters voting on the
measure.

By:	Christian	Bettenhausen,

City Attorney

The above statement is an impartial analysis of
Measure “W”. If you desire a copy of the measure,
please call the Blythe City Clerk’s office at (760) 922-
6161 and a copy will be mailed at no cost to you.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE “W”

Arguments in favor of Measure “W” include:

•	The Blythe City Council unanimously approved the placement of
the sales tax increase on the ballot;

•The City needs revenue to deliver the needed services
and infrastructure the resident’s demand, like roads, police
protection, fire protection, recreation center activities, senior
center activities, promoting our City, and cleaning our City;

•	This increase will sunset (go away) in five years;

•	The Blythe Volunteer Fire Chief, Billy Kern said, “the citizens of
Blythe will benefit from the quality of life improvements that will
come from the additional resources”;

•The City of Blythe has reduced its workforce by 48% and
operating supplies by 16% since 2008;

•	City officials argue this revenue is vital to providing the necessary
City services;

•	If measure “W” does not pass, the continued likelihood of
additional cuts is inevitable;

•	Two of the biggest problems that face the City of Blythe are the
lack of funding to address their negative fund balance or negative
cash and the road improvement funding, the proponents argue.

The sales tax would increase from 8.0% to 8.5%; this .5% increase
would be approximately $600,000 of revenue to address the above
needs. This would be paid by, not only Blythe residents, but also those
who pass through our City. For every $1 spent, it would be $.05 or, on
average, $22 per year/per resident.
