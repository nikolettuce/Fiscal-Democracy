CITY OF SANTA PAULA IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS PREPARED BY THE CITY ATTORNEY* MEASURE "J"  If enacted, Measure J will impose a new general tax on the use of gas, electricity, cable television, and telephone services. Measure J defines all such services as “utility services."  The amount of the general tax would be $6.00 per month on each utility service account with a billing address located within the City’s jurisdiction. Measure J refers to this tax as a “Utility User Tax" or “UUT.“ In public reports, the City estimates that the UUT would generate total revenue of approximately $2,224,500 each year. This revenue could be used for the City's general governmental purposes.  If enacted, Measure J would also cause creation of a seven member oversight committee. Members serving on the Measure J Oversight Committee would represent several different community interests and be responsible for providing public reports regarding the City’s use of UUT revenue. The City’s elected officials are ineligible to participate on the Measure J Oversight Committee. All meetings of the Measure J Oversight Committee would conform with California open meeting laws.  Unless extended by voter approval in November 2008, Measure J would be automatically repealed on December 31,2009.  To be adopted, Measure J must be approved by a simple majority of the voters in the City of Santa Paula.  A "yes" vote on Measure J favors imposition of the UUT.  A “no” vote on Measure J opposes imposition of the UUT.  'Section 9280 of the California Elections Code requires the City Attorney to prepare an impartial analysis of each city measure appearing on the ballot	ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE “J"  Dear Neighbors,  Our ability to keep our own police and fire departments is at risk. By voting for Measure J, you will provide enough money to keep public safety officers under local control, put more police officers on the street and purchase f' urgently needed fire-fighting equipment. i.  Having our own local police department means that we receive a higher level of personalized attention and community understanding from the people responsible for keeping us safe. This makes a big difference in protecting us if a major disaster strikes.  We’re asking residents to approve a flat, $6 fee on four utilities - electric, gas, cable television and local telephone. This will cost each household no more than $24 a month, or 80 cents per day. We will all pay the same rate because we all benefit equally from police and fire protection. This Utility User Tax automatically expires in five years.  Because of state budget problems, Santa Paula, like other cities, is in a financial crisis. There are few options. Utility User Taxes are commonly used in California to provide funding for essential city services. To ensure these funds are used as promised, we will establish a Citizens Oversight Committee, made up of Santa Paula residents, to ensure that funds raised through this measure are appropriately spent.  We don’t make this request lightly. However, maintaining local control over our police and fire departments is our top priority. We also believe recruiting and retaining new police officers and firefighters and providing them with the equipment they need are worthwhile investments.  We hope you’ll join with our local police and firefighters in voting Yes on Measure J. They will appreciate your vote of confidence in them.  s/Dr. Gabino Aguirre Mayor  s/Mary Ann Krause Vice Mayor  s/John T. Procter Councilmember  s/Ray C. Luna V „ Councilmember  s/Richard C. Cook Councilmember
CITY OF SANTA PAULA TITLE AND SUMMARY PREPARED BY THE CITY ATTORNEY* MEASURE “J”  IN INITIATIVE MEASURE APPROVING A UTILITY USER TAX FOR THE PURPOSE OF RAISING REVENUE FOR THE CITY OF SANTA PAULA’S GENERAL GOVERNMENTAL PURPOSES.  Section 1 of the Initiative adds a new Chapter 37.100 to Title 3 of the Santa Paula Municipal Code. ("SPMC") entitled "Utility User Tax" and consisting of §§ 37.100 to 37.139. Chapter 37.100 imposes a six dollar ($6) flat tax on four different utilities generally defined as gas, electricity, cable television, and telephone services. Chapter 37.100 creates an oversight committee which would draft public reports on the manner in which the City expends tax revenue generated by the utility user tax. Further, Chapter 37.100 establishes the methods and procedures for administering the utility user tax including, without limitation, collection, enforcement, and appeals procedures. The Chapter will be automatically repealed on December 31, 2009 unless a new initiative measure deletes or extends that date.  Section 2 states that if any portion of the Initiative is held invalid, the remaining portions will remain valid.  Section 3 makes it clear that the purpose of the initiative is to impose a general tax and will be submitted to a general election for voter approval on November 2,2004.  Section 4 states that the Mayor and City Clerk will sign the Initiative if it is adopted by a majority of the voters.  ‘Pursuant to California Elections Code 9203, the City Attorney has prepared the following title and summary of the chief purpose and points of the proposed measure.  9218IA	NO ARGUMENT AGAINST THIS MEASURE WAS SUBMITTED
