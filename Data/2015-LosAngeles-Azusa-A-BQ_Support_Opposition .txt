Ballot question

The question on the ballot:[i]

Shall Ordinance 14-1544 be adopted extending the 2% Utility Users' Tax
on electricity & gas, and adding water, cable, telephone & cellular utilities
to continue essential services, including police, park enforcement teams,
gang intervention, youth recreation programs, graffiti removal, Meals on
Wheels, senior programs & stroke recovery, sidewalk & street repair, city
special events, staffing parks, and addressing blight caused by loss of
redevelopment revenue, while exempting senior and low-income
households?^]

Support

Council Member Lula Davis-Holmes, referring to the intended uses of the increased tax
revenue and the included senor and low-income exemptions, said, “I want to keep
reminding people that these are some of the components they wanted to keep in place
— senior programs, youth programs. And seniors and low-income residents aren’t
affected. ”[2]

Opposition

Councilman Mike Gipson, who was the sole dissenter when the council voted to put this
measure before voters, argued that the city should have simply asked to extend the
same tax, without adding the additional utilities. Gipson said, “I’m of the mind that we
should certainly exclude (cable). I’d rather just move forward with what voters are
accustomed to doing.”[2]
