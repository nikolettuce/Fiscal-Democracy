Amount: $16-$64/unit
Expires: 8 years

A parcel tax question was on the ballot for South Pasadena voters in Los Angeles County,
California, on November 3, 2015. It was approved.

Measure L extended the city's library parcel tax for eight years. It also increased the parcel tax
rates depending on size and type of property according to the following formulas:[1]

■	Fewer than 2,000 square feet: increase from $24 per year to $32 per year

■	Between 2,001 and 4,000 square feet: increase from $36 per year to $48 per year

■	Larger than 4,000 square feet: increase from $48 per year to $64 per year

■	Multi-unit residential parcels: increase from $12/unit per year to $16/unit per year

■	Non-residential parcels: between $32 and $128 per year, depending on the size of the
property.

The city had levied a library parcel tax since 1994. The
continuation of the tax was last approved by voters in November
2009, also under the name Measure L. Between 2009 and 2015,
the tax generated about $230,000 per year in revenue for the
city's library system. The tax was set to expire in 2016 without the
approval of Measure L by voters in 2015.[1]

A two-thirds (66.67 percent) supermajority vote was required for
the approval of Measure L.

Ballot question

The following question appeared on the ballot:^

To keep the South Pasadena Public Library open every day and to help update its
M technology, shall an ordinance be adopted extending the Library Special Tax for 8 years;
setting the rate for homeowners at $32-$64/year depending on residential square
footage; for non-residential property owners at $32-$128/year based on lot size and for
multi-family property owners at $16/unit; and adding an annual Los Angeles Consumer 99
Price Index adjustment?^

Support

Supporters

The South Pasadena Yes on L committee was formed to campaign in support of the library parcel
taxJ4]

The following individuals signed the official argument in support of Measure L:^

■	Bob Joe, mayor of South Pasadena

■	Edward Pearson, president of the library board of trustees

■	Jon Primuth, president South Pasadena
Education Foundation

■	Ann Messana, president of Friends of the South
Pasadena Library

■	Brendan Durrett, chair of We Love Our Library:

Yes on Measure L

Arguments in favor

The following statement in support of Measure L was posted on the South Pasadena Yes on L
website:

In 1994 our community showed its support for the library by overwhelmingly passing the
d parcel tax. It has been renewed by large margins three times since then. It generates
about 15% of the library budget.

The renewed parcel tax would be $32.00 per year for most South Pasadena homes
(there is an exemption for residents with low household incomes). This is a modest
increase over the rate set in 1994, to account for inflation over the past 21 years. There
will also be a Consumer Price Index factor starting next year so we do not fall behind
again. For this small fee the benefits to our community are tremendous.

The South Pasadena library is well-used and beloved by South Pasadenans. At the
library people borrow books, CDs and DVDs, read magazines for leisure, bring their
children to Storytimes, attend free programs for their own enrichment and enjoyment,
and more. In 2014 we circulated over 430,000 items, over 280,000 people of all ages
entered the library, 2,650 children participated in the summer reading program, and
overall about 28,000 people enjoyed over 500 programs.

Without the revenue from the parcel tax, our library would not be able to remain open
seven days a week or perform much needed technological upgrades. There would be
cuts to the hours, staff, book collection, internet access, children’s programs and	99

extensive offerings we enjoy today. ^

Official arguments

The following was submitted as the official argument in favor of Measure L:

In 1994 the South Pasadena community showed its support for the library by
d overwhelmingly passing the parcel tax. It has been renewed by large margins three
times since then. The parcel tax generates about 15% of the library budget.

Measure L would renew the parcel tax for eight years. The tax would be $32 per year for
most South Pasadena homes (there is an exemption for residents with low household
incomes). The rates would be:

Single family residences: $32-$64 per year (depending on size)

Multi-family residences: $16 per unit per year
Non-residential parcels: $32-$128 per year (depending on size)

This is a modest increase over the rates set in 1994, to account for inflation over the
past 21 years. There will also be a Consumer Price Index factor starting next year so we
do not fall behind again.

For this small fee the benefits to our community are tremendous.

The South Pasadena library is well-used and beloved by South Pasadenans. At the
library people borrow books, CDs and DVDs, read magazines, bring children to
storytimes, attend free programs for their own enrichment and enjoyment, and more. In
2014 we circulated over 430,000 items, more than 280,000 people of all ages and
backgrounds visited the library, 2,650 children participated in the Summer Reading
Program, and about 28,000 people enjoyed over 500 educational and cultural programs.
Over 85% of South Pasadena students have library cards.

Without parcel tax revenue out library would be unable to remain open seven days a
week or perform needed technological upgrades such as enhancing Wi-Fi access and
acquiring additional public computer workstations. There would be cuts to the hours,
staff, book collection, internet access, children's programs and extensive offerings we
enjoy today.

Thank you very much for your support of the library.^
