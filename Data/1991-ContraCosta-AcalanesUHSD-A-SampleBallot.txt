ACALANES UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT
SPECIAL TAX MEASURE A ELECTION
TUESDAY, JUNE 4, 1991

Our schools need additional local funds in order to adequately prepare our students for the
future. Measure A is an investment in quality education for all the students of our community.

The facts are:

*	Our schools cannot rely on state funding. The Acalanes Union High School District
faces approximately $2 million in instructional program cutbacks due to dramatic cuts
in state education funding.

*	If additional local funds are not raised, the District will be forced to reduce the number
of teachers, librarians and other staff working to educate our children.

‘ If additional local funds are not raised, class sites in our schools will increase signifi-
cantly.

Passage of Measure A will raise the local funds wo need to:

*	maintain a wide range of instructional classes for our students.

’ avoid class size increases.

*	maintain necessary library services in our high schools.

' provide needed instructional materials in our high schools.

Measure A will raise the local funds our schools need at a reasonable cost. Measure A will
cost each property owner just $42 per year, only $3.50 per month. These funds are an
investment in educational excellence for our students and our community.
