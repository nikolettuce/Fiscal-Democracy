CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

Ballot Proposition “B” proposes to raise revenue for general purposes for the City of
National City by authorizing a one percent transaction and use tax (commonly referred
to as a "sales tax") within the City of National City. The one cent tax would be paid in
addition to current sales taxes and would be collected at the same time and in the
same manner as existing sales taxes.

California Revenue and Taxation Code Section 7285.9 authorizes the City Council to
levy a transaction and use tax at a rate of 0.25 percent or a multiple thereof, provided
the tax is approved by a majority of the voters voting in an election on that issue. If
approved, the tax would go into effect April 1,2006.

Proposition “B” states that the one percent sales tax is to be used "for City services,
facilities and programs.” Because this sales tax would be a "general tax ” the tax would
go into the City's general fund and could be used for any legal municipal purpose. The
City would not be legally bound in any way to use the tax monies for any special
purpose or for any particular services, facilities or programs.

Proposition UB” provides that every five years the Mayor, with the approval of the City
Council, shall appoint an independent committee comprised of three experts in
financial matters, who will report back their recommendation to the Mayor and City
Council as to whether the transaction and use tax should remain in effect, or be placed
on the ballot to be repealed by a majority of the voters voting thereon.

s One-half to two-thirds of the new money collected will be paid by people who
live outside of National City and make purchases here

s City officials recommend increasing the sales tax as the best way to raise
money since more people work here than live here

s City officials chose riot to raise property tax or impose a utility user tax

NO TAX ON HOUSING. MEDICINE OR GROCERY FOOD

CITY WANTS TO CONTROL OWN DESTINY

s This new penny cannot be taken by the State

NO PLACE ELSE FOR MONEY

^The City and the Redevelopment Agency (CDC) are separate and the City
cannot use CDC property tax increment money for city services

INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT

J Three person independent oversight committee with financial expertise will
recommend every five years if the tax needs to stay

A YES vote on “B" provides funds for vital services and prevents cuts in City
services

ARGUMENT AGAINST PROPOSITION B

Former Mayor George Waters left this Mayor and Council 7 million dollars in reserves
less than 2 years ago, and that’s all gone. The city now says they need another
12 million to right the financial ship, and they want this in the form of a one-cent sales
tax increase. Is it a fair question for us to ask how did we get into this financial
quagmire, and where did this money go? As publisher of the Gorham Report I have
been bringing you reports for the last 2 years about 18 percent council raises, $7,000
tamale parties for the mayors dad, outlandish car allowances, employees getting
promotions with hefty raises, consultants for almost every department at salaries that
you and I only dream about. In my opinion the above-mentioned reasons, and this
mayor and council’s thirst and obsession for eminent domain projects, and their lack of
fiscal discipline have all contributed to this need for higher taxes. Do we really know
that they won't also squander this money, and ask us for another tax hike next year?
I’m sure they will argue that they need this money for police, and fire, and other
services, and if we don't pass it we will suffer as a city. I have news for them, were
suffering now. Property taxes doubled when they added the sewer bill to it, trash went
up, permits for house hold repairs are going through the roof, our properties are being
taken from us, how much more do we need to suffer? If this passes, and remember
that it only takes 50 percent plus 1 vote, National City will then have the highest sales
tax in all 18 cities, then where do you think people will shop?

i URGE A NO VOTE ON THIS ONE-CENT TAX!
