IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF COBB AREA
COUNTY WATER DISTRICT MEASURE “K”

California law authorizes the board of directors of a
county water district to impose a special tax for specific
purposes. Such a special tax may be imposed to fund
any one or more services which a county water district is
authorized to provide. The resolution or ordinance impos-
ing the tax, as adopted by the board of directors, must
specify the type of tax and rate of tax to be imposed and
any special tax must apply uniformly to all taxpayers or
all real property within the district. A resolution or ordi-
nance imposing such a special tax must be approved by
two-thirds of the voters voting upon the measure within
the district. In addition, if such a special tax is imposed as
approved by the voters, the district is required to annually
file an Accountability Report specifying the amount of
funds collected and expended from said special tax and
the status of any specific project to be funded by said tax.
This is such a measure.

This measure, if approved by two-thirds of the voters
voting thereon, will approve the action of the Board of
Directors of the Cobb Area County Water District to
impose a special tax within the Cobb Area County Water
District in the amount of fifty-five dollars ($55.00) per year
on each buildable parcel within the Cobb Area County
Water District, said tax to commence with fiscal year
2006-2007 and continue for a period of fifteen (15) years,
said tax revenue to be used for the purpose of purchas-
ing all or part of the “Schwartz Spring” and an adjoining
zone of protection known and identified as Assessor’s
Parcel No’s. 013-003-65, 013-005-02, and 013-048-03.

This measure is authorized by and is in conformity
with the existing laws of the State of California.

A yes vote on this measure will approve the action
of the Board of Directors of the Cobb Area County Water
District to impose a special tax on all buildable parcels of
real property in the Cobb Area County Water District for
the purpose of acquiring the water source and adjoining
properties identified in the measure.

A no vote on this measure will disapprove the action
of the Board of Directors of the Cobb Area County Water
District to impose such a special tax as set forth above.

S/ CAMERON L. REEVES
County Counsel

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE K

The Board of Directors of the Cobb Area Water
District brings Measure “K” before you for your approval.
The purpose is to provide you the customer, with the
opportunity to have your Water District purchase some or
all of 200-acres of Cobb Mountain, on which is located
Schwartz Spring. Schwartz Spring now produces over
200-gallons per minute of high quality, naturally flowing,
water.

As of this writing (8/18/05) the current owners have
offered this property for sale. It is the goal of the
Directors to have the District gain not only ownership of
the spring, but more importantly control of its waters, the
protection of its surrounding area, and our future. If
Schwartz Spring is sold to a commercial water developer,
the Cobb Area Water District could eventually be at the
developer’s mercy.

in order to accomplish this purchase of Schwartz
Spring and to protect the area around it, the District
would have to acquire a loan from a banking institution.
According to the Board’s calculations, repayment of this
loan would require a $55.00 per-year-per-parcel special
tax on each buildable parcel in the District for a period of
15-years. It is the goal of the Board of Directors to use
whatever means possible to repay this loan beyond what
is collected each year in the special tax, but without using
monies collected from water rates. The Board has
restricted Measure “K" to insure that monies collected
can only be used for the repayment of this loan, and if it
is paid off prior to the 15-year period the special tax must
be cancelled.

Please do not confuse Measure “K” with other
County initiatives which have recently been proposed,
this is a Cobb Area Water District issue only!
