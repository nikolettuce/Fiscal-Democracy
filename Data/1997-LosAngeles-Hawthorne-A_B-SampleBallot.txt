CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF PROPOSITION A

By Glen E. Shishido, City Attorney and Daniel Juarez, City Clerk

Ballot Proposition A will extend the existing 1995 City of Hawthorne Utility User
Tax Rate indefinitely. The City now collects approximately 7.8 Million in annual
revenues from the utility user tax.

Proposition A is a general tax, and revenues collected under Proposition A will
be used to pay for the cost of general city operations, including police protection,
fire/paramedics services, building inspections, code enforcement, park
maintenance and other public services.

In December, 1995, the California Supreme Court held for the first time that
general taxes require voter approval. In addition, at the November 5, 1996
General Election, Proposition No. 218, the Right To Vote On Taxes Act, was
approved. The California Supreme Court decision, as well as this proposition,
changed the law governing the approval of general taxes, such as the Utility User
Tax.

If Proposition A is approved by a majority vote, the existing utility user tax on
electricity, gas and telephone/telecommunications and other utility services will
continue to be applied to utility bills. The tax is paid by the consumer as part of
the utility bill and the tax will be collected by the utility companies from each
customer and then paid to the City. Low income senior citizens are exempted.

If this measure is ratified and approved by the voters, the City may not increase
the tax rate without approval of the voters.

If Proposition A is not approved, the amount collected by the Utility User Tax
will decrease from $7.8 Million to $3.9 Million during this fiscal year. This loss
equals about 17% of the annual general tax revenue fund. Similar losses will occur
in future years. The financial effect on the City of losing this revenue will be
- severe. At the time of this writing, the city council is considering the adoption of
a contingency Budget Plan, describing reductions that will be necessary if the
existing utility user tax and the business license tax are not extended, including
the following reductions.

Police Department—cut 35 full-time police officers, 6 full-time civilian
employees and 35 part-time positions; Department of Recreation and
Community Services—cut 8 full-time employees and 94 part-time positions; and
other City Departments—cut 10 full-time employees and 9 part-time positions.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Ballot Proposition “A.” If you
desire a copy of the ordinance, please call the office of the City Clerk at (310)
970-7921 and a copy will be mailed at no cost to you.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION A

Propositions (A) and (B) arc HAWTHORNE’S RIGHT TO VOTE ON TAXES
ACT. Your YKS votes on Propositions (A) and (B) take the power to tax out of

the politicians hands and gives it to the voters.

Remember Proposition 13? It was supposed to give us tax relief. And it worked
for a while, then the politicians started playing games. It didn’t take long for them
to subject us to all sorts of fees and assessments that are nothing but taxes in
disguise. You can change that.

Your YES votes on Propositions (A) and (B) will ensure that Hawthorne taxes
cannot be raised again without voter approval. That’s right, no more tax increases
or new taxes, unless we the voters say yes.

Read this ballot measure carefully. It absolutely freezes your city taxes. Don’t be
misled by former Politicians and their scare tactics. A YES vote on Propositions
(A) and (B) WILL NOT CHANGE YOUR TAXES.

The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth is, that by voting YES on
Propositions (A) and (B) you will GUARANTEE THAT YOUR CITY TAXES CAN

NEVER BE RAISED AGAIN without voter approval.

The future of our City is on the line. We need your help. Please join the many
concerned citizens of Hawthorne in voting YES on Propositions (A) and (B). It
is the right thing to do for our City and the safety of our families.

Thank you for your support.

VOTE YES ON PROPOSITIONS (A) & (B)

i________________ARGUMENT AGAINST PROPOSITION A___________________

Proposition A is another piece of deception from our current City Council and
Staff. While it claims to freeze the current tax rate, it is actually asking for voter
approval of the doubling of the city tax on your utility bills, from 5 % to 10%. This
| was a temporary increase in 1995 to end in 1999.

I It’s time to say NO, NOT ONE PENNY MORE until our city government changes
f the way it does business. Look at the Mall, the boulevard and our businesses.
| Failed redevelopment projects have led to massive debt. A majority of the money
} received by this tax increase is being used to pay for these mistakes. This tax
rewards bad management. It will not bring more police or better services.

The Utility User’s Tax was a temporary tax imposed in 1983 at 3.5% to expire
| in 10 years. Poor redevelopment decisions and poor management brought our city
|	to the brink of bankruptcy. To prevent this from happening, the council has

{ repeatedly extended and increased the tax to its current level of 10%. We believed
them when they said the tax would be reduced in 1999. Now they want to freeze
it. That means forever.

City employees may come knocking on your door with threats, that you will lose
your police department, your parks, and your Senior Center. They hope to scare
you into voting yes on the utility tax, but we must demand accountability from
our city council and staff.

Vote NO on Proposition A; reduce your taxes. Homeowners need the money to
help pay for the increase in property taxes due to the school bonds. Renters need
the money to help pay their increased rent because of the school bonds.

Vote NO on Proposition A.

CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAi.ANAL.YSIS OF PROPOSITION B

By Glen t. Shishido, City Attorney and Daniel Juarez, City Clerk

Ballot Proposition B will extend the existing 1995 City of Hawthorne Business
License Tax Rate indefinitely. The City now collects approximately $1.3 Million
in annual revenues from the business license tax.

Proposition B is a general tax, and revenues collected under Proposition B will
be used to pay for the cost of general city operations, including police protection,
fire/paramedic services, building inspections, code enforcement, park
maintenance and other public services.

In December 1995, the California Supreme Court held for the first time that
general taxes require voter approval. In addition, at the November 5, 1996
General Election, Proposition No. 218, the Right To Vote on Taxes Act, was
approved. The California Supreme Court decision, as well as this proposition,
changed the law governing the approval of general taxes, such as the Business
License Tax.

If Proposition B is approved by a majority vote, the existing business license tax
imposed On businesses operating within the City of Hawthorne will continue to
be applied against business owners. The tax is paid by the business and/or business
owner and will be collected by the City through the Business License Division.

If this measure is ratified and approved by the voters, the City may not increase
the tax rate without approval of the voters.

If Proposition B is not approved, the amount collected by the business license tax
will decrease by $1.3 million during this fiscal year. This loss equals about 6% of
the annual general tax revenue fund. Similar losses will occur in future years. The
financial effect on the City of losing this revenue source will be severe. At the time
of this writing, the city council is considering the adoption of a contingency Budget
I	Plan,	describing	reductions	that will be necessary if the existing business license

tax and the utility user tax are not extended, including the following reductions.

Police Department—cut 35 full-time police officers, 6 full-time civilian
employees and 35 part-time positions: Department of Recreation and
Community Services—cut 8 full-time employees and 94 part-time positions; and
other City Departments—cut 10 full-time employees and 9 part-time positions.
