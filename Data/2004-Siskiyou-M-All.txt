Section 2. Title. This Resolution may be cited as the “Uniform
Transient Occupancy Tax Resolution of 2004.”

Section 3. Proposal. California Revenue and Taxation Code
Section 7280 provides that counties may levy a tax on the privilege
of occupying a room or other lodging for not more than 30 days,
called a “transient occupancy tax," and Section 8-4.03 of the Siskiyou
County Code establishes the County”s transient occupancy tax at
eight percent (8%), which tax was last increased in 1990. It is
proposed that a general tax measure to increase the#transient
occupancy tax to ten percent (10%) be submitted to the voters of
the County of Siskiyou at the primary election on Tuesday, November
2, 2004. Such action is taken pursuant to California Constitution
Article XIIIC, §2(b) which requires that any general tax be passed
by a two-thirds vote of the legislative body, and by a majority of the
voters voting in an election on the tax which is consolidated with a
regularly scheduled general election of members of the governing
body.

Section 4. Rate to be Charged as a General Tax. The Siskiyou
County Board of Supervisors does hereby find that a general tax
which is an increase of the transient occupancy tax by two percent
(2%), and which will be collected by the operators of hotels as
provided in Title 8, Chapter 4 of the Siskiyou County Code, is in
the best interests of the County of Siskiyou.

Section 5. The Siskiyou County Board of Supervisors finds and
declares that this is a general tax, for general governmental
purposes, and not a special or ad valorem tax.

Section 6. Method of Collection. This general tax, if confirmed
by the voters, shall be collected as provided in Title 8, Chapter 4,
Section 8-4.05 of the Siskiyou County Code.

Section 7. Election Date. The proposed general tax shall be
submitted to the voters of the County of Siskiyou at the election to
be included and consolidated with the election held on November
2, 2004. Notice of the time and place of holding the election is
given and the County Clerk is authorized, instructed and directed
to give further or additional notice of the election, in time, form, and
manner as required by law.

Section 8. Effective Date of Tax. This Resolution, being for
the enactment and imposition of a general tax, shall be submitted
to a vote of the qualified voters at the general election of November
2, 2004, The tax shall become valid and binding if a majority of
the voters voting thereon vote in its favor at said election and shall
be effective on the date that the Board of Supervisors certifies the
results of said election.

Section 9. Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence,
clause or phrase of this Resolution is for any reason held to be
invalid, unconstitutional, or otherwise unlawful, by the decision of a
court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the remaining portions of this Resolution, the application
thereof, and the general taxes imposed shall not be effected thereby
but shall remain in full force and effect, it being the intention of the
voters to adopt each and every section, subsection, part, clause,
sentence, or phrase, regardless of whether any other section,
subsection, part, clause, sentence, or phrase or the application
thereof is held to be invalid or unconstitutional. The Siskiyou County

Board of Supervisors hereby declares that it would have passed
this Resolution and each section, subsection, sentence, clause, or
phrase thereof irrespective of the fact that one or more of the sections,
subsections, sentences, clauses, or phrases be declared invalid,
unconstitutional, or unlawful.

<impartial> IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL
MEASURE M

Presently the County of Siskiyou collects a transient occupancy
tax for the privilege of occupancy in any “hotel” as defined by
ordinance. The current amount of such tax is eight percent (8%)
of the rent charged by the operator.

This measure, if approved by a majority vote of the people voting
on the question, would increase the amount to ten percent (10%).

According to law, the proceeds of these taxes may be placed in
the County General Fund without limitation on their use. However,
traditionally the Board of Supervisors has used these funds to help
promote tourism and recreation in the County.

A “yes” vote favors passage of this general tax, while a “No”
vote is against passage of this general tax. <impartialend>
