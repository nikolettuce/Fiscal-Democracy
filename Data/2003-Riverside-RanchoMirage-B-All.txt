herein.

Section 3. Amendment of Existing Ordinance. Section 3.24.035 of the Rancho Mirage Municipal Code authorizing the City Council to amend
the transient occupancy tax rate by resolution is hereby repealed.

Section 4. Amendment of Existing Ordinance. Section 3.24.032 of the Rancho Mirage Municipal Code is added to read as follows: The
proceeds of the 1% tax increase approved by Ordinance No. 819 approved by the City's voters on March 4.2003, will be deposited into a special fund
established to fund activities to promote the tourism and convention industry, including the payment of the City's obligations to support the Palm

Section 5. Amendment or Repeal. Chapter 3.24 of the Rancho Mirage Municipal Code, regarding the transient occupancy tax, may be

Chapter 3.24 that increases the amount or rate of tax beyond the levels authorized by this Ordinance may not take effect unless approved by a vote of
the people.

Section 6. Findings. The people of the City of Rancho Mirage find as follows:

(a)	On May 21,1992, the City Council adopted Ordinance No. 530 to increase the rate of the transient occupancy tax by 1%. In 1986 the
State's voters approved Proposition 62 to require voter approval of iocai general taxes. The City Council did not seek voter approval of Ordinance
No. 530 because a number of appeals courts, including the court which ruled in the case of City of Woodlake v. Logan. 230 Cal.App.3D 1058
(1991), had previously decided that Proposition 62's requirement that general taxes be submitted to a referendum violated the California Constitu-
tion and was therefore unenforceable. On December 14,1995, the California Supreme Court disapproved the Woodlake decision in the case of
Santa Clara County Local Transportation Authority v. Guardino. 11 Cal.4th 220 (1995). On June 4, 2001, that Court decided Howard Jarvis
Taxpayers Association v. City of La Habra, 26 Cal. 4th 236 (2001). which further suggested that the City should seek voter approval of Ordinance
No. 530 The City Council thereafter proposed this Ordinance to the voters to validate the ordinance.

(b)	The tourism and convention industry is vital to the fiscal weii-being of the City as is underscored by the fact that almost one-third of the
City's General Fund Revenue is derived from the City's transient occupancy tax. Therefore, setting aside a portion of that tax for the purpose of
promoting the tourism, and convention industry is in the best interests of the community.

(c)	This Ordinance was proposed by the City Council of the City of Rancho Mirage by the adoption of Resolution No. 2002-108.

Section 7. Intent. Section 1 of this Ordinance is intended to authorize the continued collection of the transient occupancy tax, to validate the
adoption of that tax. and to validate taxes previously collected pursuant to Ordinance No. 530. Section 2 of this Ordinance is intended to re-enact
Ordinance No. 530 to authorize future collection of the tax at the 10% rate in the event it is determined that Section 1 is not sufficient to do so.

Section 8. Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this Ordinance or Ordinance No. 530 validated or
reenactqd by it, is for any reason held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining portions of this Ordinance and
Ordinance No. 530 shall nonetheless remain in full force and effect. The City Council hereby declares that it would have adopted each section, subsec-
tion. sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this Ordinance and Ordinance No. 530, irrespective of the fact that any one or more sections, subsections,
sentences, clauses, phrases, or portions of this Ordinance and Ordinance No. 530 be declared invalid or unenforceable.

Section 9. Execution. The Mayor is hereby authorized to attest to the adoption of this Ordinance by the voters of the City by signing where
indicated below.

I hereby certify that the foregoing Ordinance was PASSED. APPROVED and ADOPTED by the people of the City of Rancho Mirage voting on the
4th day of March 2003.

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE B

The purpose of Measure B is to obtain voter approval of the continued
collection of a 1 % increase In the City's Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT).
enacted by the Rancho Mirage City Council in 1992. This tax is imposed
on persons occupying hotels or other structures within the City for up to
27 consecutive days. The tax is calculated as a percentage of the room
charge collected by the hotei operator. The City currently charges a 10%
TOT, including the 1% increase adopted by the City Council in 1992.

In 1986. California voters enacted Proposition 62. This measure required
local governments to obtain majority vote approval of the imposition or
increase of any general tax. Many legal experts opined that this voter
approval requirement violated the California Constitution. In 1991. the
California Court of Appeal published a decision in the case entitled City of
Woodiake v. Logan In which it concluded the voter approval requirement
of Proposition 62 was unconstitutional.

TOT has long been a major source of revenue to the City of Rancho
Mirage. The Rancho Mirage City Council adopted an ordinance approv-
ing a 1% increase in the TOT in 1992 At the time, the City stated its
intent to use the additional tax proceeds to help fund the promotion of the
tourism and convention industry. This tax increase was approved
without seeking voter approval.

In 1995. in a case entitled Santa Clara County Local Transportation
Authority v. Guardmo. the California Supreme Court overruled the
Woodiake decision, and concluded that the Proposition 62 voter
approval requirement was not unconstitutional. Since that time, a
number of cases have decided issues of whether taxes enacted before
the Guardino decision were subject to challenge. In 2001, the California
Supreme Court concluded in a case entitled Howard Jarvis Taxpayers
Association v. City ot La Habra that as a practical matter there is no
statute of limitations for challenging taxes like the TOT increase that were
enacted without voter approval.

The proposed measure, if passed, wouid authorize the continued collec-
tion of the 1% TOT increase approved by the City Council in 1992. The
measure would also amend existing city law to provide that the proceeds
from the 1 % tax would be placed in a special fund, and would be legally
restricted for use in promoting the convention and tourism industry. The
measure authorizes the City Council to adopt modifications to the TOT
ordinance without voter approval, provided the modifications do not
increase the amount of the tax. Finally, the measure repeais a provision
of the existing TOT ordinance that allows the City Council to establish the
TOT tax rate by resolution.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE "B"

First, let’s make two points clear. Hotel taxes are not paid by Rancho
Mirage residents. This measure does not impose new or increased
taxes on anyone, including hotel guests. But this Measure is extremely
important to Rancho Mirage’s future.

Surprisingly, of the property faxes paid by Rancho Mirage residents,
almost none goes to the City. The City pays its bills mainly through our
“Bed Tax” and sales taxes. Bed taxes are technically known as Transient
Occupancy Taxes, (“TOT”).

Currently a 10% Bed Tax is paid by guests staying at Rancho Mirage
hotels. Compare our rate to Palm Springs, which imposes an 12 Vi% bed
tax.

Because of a recent judicial' decision Rancho Mirage will be required to
revert to a 9% bed tax unless this Measure is passed. City income will
drop measurably.

The 1 % difference is money substantially earmarked for our Convention
and Visitors Authority, which is used to attract more visitors to our hotels
- which accordingly increases Rancho Mirage’s income. Even our hotels
support this Measure.

The court decision holds that we cannot continue this additional 1%
without a separate vote of the people. Your affirmative vote will ensure
our City and hotels will not lose this important promotional money.
Money that is critically essential if we are to continue to actively promote
tourism.

Since 1992 all visitors to our hotels have paid a 10% TOT. They expect
it. Our current 10% rate provides conventions an incentive to use City
hotels, while significantly benefittlng the City, as well

Nothing changes if we pass this Measure But if it fails, our City will lose
approximately $500,000 per year, and who knows how much tourism, if
it fails, how do we recoup this much needed income? Let's avoid that
unpleasant question and VOTE YES ON MEASURE "B’’.
