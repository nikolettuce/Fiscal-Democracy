Impartial analysis / Proposal

CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE Y This ballot measure amends the current City of Pomona Zoning Ordinance
to allow the installation of up to ten Offsite Outdoor Advertising Signs (“billboards”) at nine specific freeway-adjacent locations
situated along the Orange (57) Freeway, Chino Valley (71) Freeway, and Pomona (60) Freeway. Measure Y identifies specific
locations along the freeway corridors and imposes restrictions upon the location, height, and size of the billboards. Measure Y

Arguments FOR

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE Y Vote YES on MEASURE Y. Over 8500 of your fellow Pomona residents signed petitions
requesting that this measure be placed on the ballot. A YES vote on Y will provide the City with an additional $250,000 annually
in unrestricted funds to support more fire, police, library and recreation services as well as street and park maintenance. It will
NOT increase our taxes. It will make the sign company pay the city a fair-share of its advertising revenue to benefit city

VOTE NO on YUCKY MEASURE “Y” THIS is what THEY AREN’T TELLING you: Distracted drivers are the number one cause of fatal
car collisions. Police and firefighters responding to one fatal car accident will cost more than the $250,000 we’ll get annually,
from the billboard owners! These huge electronic signs (dangerous driver’s distractions), HAVE BEEN BANNED in the CITY of
LOS ANGELES! Don’t be deceived by people who are paid lots of money to gather signatures: They were paid to eliminate city
districts in Pomona, remember? They brought the trash transfer station, but we still don’t have additional police officers, longer
library hours, or better parks as they promised. What we have is additional toxic air pollution and an increase in the campaign
accounts of some elected officials! Neither the city nor the residents will control the advertisers’ messages/graphics (sleazy
ads, adult entertainment, alcohol, weapons?) Non-profits and city will get discounts, but they will still have to pay. JUST
ANOTHER LOPSIDED DEAL The owners will make millions, even billions, while Pomona will receive a mere pittance. Adding insult
to injury, it’ll take 40 years for Pomona to receive the ten million listed in the contract. NO WAY! Yucky measure Y doesn’t
deserve your vote. NO GOOD DEAL- NO BILLBOARDS Pomona has plenty of billboards already, but if you want to add electronic
billboards, the city council must re-negotiate for a shorter, more profitable contract. Pomona deserves better! Our public safety
and Pomona’s future are not for sale. Say no! Respectfully, Cristina Carrizosa CRISTINA N. CARRIZOSA City Council Member
MARICRUZ HERNANDEZ Resident RUBIO GONZALEZ Commissioner

MEASURE “Y” IS A GOOD DEAL FOR POMONA RESIDENTS!!! The opposition apparently doesn’t know a good deal when they see
one. Measure “Y” will generate $250,000 dollars per year to the City General Fund. It will pay the City $10 million dollars in
total. The opposition supported a bad deal for $100,000 a year for a total of $1 million. They don’t mention that. Measure “Y”
will make the billboard companies pay a fair share of their profits to the City of Pomona. The opposition doesn’t want you to
know about the bad deal they made for the City Measure “Y” allows state-of-the-art electronic message signs with free
advertising for the city and charities. The opposition supported ugly old billboards in their bad deal! Measure “Y” has design
controls and strict content controls. The opposition was wrong to state “there would be no city control of the content”. Measure
“Y” will provide more money for Libraries, Police and Fire services as stated in the City Attorney’s independent analysis. The
opposition simply wants to spend the money on something else. Measure “Y” was signed by over 8500 residents of Pomona and
supported by many Pomona charities and businesses and the city employees. The opposition wants to ignore the will of the
voters and keep their bad deal. Measure “Y” gives Pomona Voters the chance to tell the City Council they want a better deal!
