IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE B
BY COUNTY COUNSEL

WESTWOOD COMMUNITY SERVICES DISTRICT
SPECIAL TAX MEASURE B

This measure would authorize Westwood Community Services
District to assess a special property tax for each fiscal year at rates adjusted
annually by the Board of Directors of the District which rate shall not exceed
$45.00 per parcel (excluding property of a federal, state or local government
agency) for fire suppression, protection and prevention equipment and
services.

The special property taxes would be collected in the same manner
and subject to the same penalties as County Property taxes are collected.

The special property tax is to become effective upon the favorable
vote of two thirds of the voters voting upon the measure.

John T. Ketelsen
Lassen County Counsel

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE B

A yes vote on measure "B" would help replace revenue lost after the
implementation of Proposition 218 which prohibits the use of restricted funds,
such as water and sewer revenue, to be used for emergency services.

It would create a reliable mechanism of funding for the fire department.

It would enable the department to close the gap between non-compliance
and compliance of mandatory codes and regulations set forth by the Office of
Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) and the National Fire Protection
Association (NFPA),

It would enable the department to re-establish vital fire prevention and safety
programs for our schools and community.

It would enable the department to continue its abatement of hazardous fire
conditions, public nuisance, vehicle's, and unsafe structures.

It would help the department upgrade and replace out dated and unreliable
equipment.

It would enable the department to purchase necessary equipment mandatory
for volunteer firefighters such as breathing apparatus and personal protective
equipment.

Lastly, It would enable the department to make necessary repairs on the fire
hall mandated by OSHA and NFPA.

SUMMARY; A YES vote on measure "B" will allow the Westwood Fire
Department to perform it's duties within the standards set by the industry,
OSHA and the NFPA.

More importantly, it will increase our department's effectiveness and help to
create a safer working environment for our volunteers and paid staff.

A NO vote measure "B" will drastically reduce the effectiveness of our
department by eliminating public education, training, and equipment
necessary for fire suppression and rescue operations.

Please help us overcome the effects of Proposition 218 and it's political
ramifications by voting YES on measure "B”
