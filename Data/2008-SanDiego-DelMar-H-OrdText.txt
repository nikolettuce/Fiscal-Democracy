CITY ATTORNEY IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF PROPOSITION H

The City of Del Mar currently imposes a ten and one-half percent transient
occupancy tax which was approved by the voters in 2002. The transient
occupancy tax is imposed only on hotel visitors who visit the City of Del Mar for
thirty days or less. The tax is collected by the hotel operator based on the room
rent paid by visitors and transmitted to the City. The City’s transient occupancy
tax is a general tax and, in accordance with California law, the tax rate may not
be increased unless approved by a majority of the voters in the City of Del Mar.
On July 21, 2008, the City Council adopted a resolution submitting to the voters
an ordinance amending subsection (A) of Chapter 3.12.010 that would permit the
City to increase the TOT rate up to thirteen percent.

Proposition H is the ordinance that was approved by the City Council on July 21,
2008. If approved by the voters, Proposition H would amend Del Mar Municipal
Code section 3.12.010 (A) to allow the City to increase the transient occupancy
tax rate by no more than two and one half percent for a total transient occupancy
tax rate of up to thirteen percent. Revenue collected from the transient
occupancy tax is deposited into the City’s general fund to pay for general
governmental services such as fire protection, parks, police protection, and other
community services.

If Proposition H is approved by the voters, the City Council could, depending on
the totality of circumstances, adopt a resolution increasing the TOT up to 2.5%
for a maximum TOT of 13%. If a majority of the voters vote “no” on this
Proposition, then the City’s transient occupancy tax rate will remain at ten and
one-half percent.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Proposition H. If you desire a
copy of the Proposition, please call the City Clerk’s office at (858) 755-9313.

Date: August 20, 2008

Argument in Favor of Proposition H

Vote Yes on Proposition H ~ the Hotel Visitor Tax Measure

On November 4, 2008, Del Mar residents will cast an important vote concerning
the tax rate paid by hotel visitors for overnight stays in Del Mar. This tax (known
as the Transient Occupancy Tax or “TOT”) is currently set at 10.5% in Del Mar.

A “YES” vote on Proposition H would allow for the tax to be set at a rate up to
13%. If approved, Proposition H will allow the City to set Del Mar’s TOT at a rate
commensurate with adjacent cities. For example, an increase in the TOT rate to
13% could allow the City to collect approximately $417,000 more annually for the
City of Del Mar’s General Fund. The General Fund pays for City services that
are provided to residents and hotel visitors alike for their use of public facilities
including streets, beaches, parks, fire and police services, and for capital
projects.

It is a tax that is paid by visitors....plain and simple. Unlike other revenue
sources, every TOT dollar collected stays in Del Mar.

Vote “YES” on Proposition H to ensure that visitors pay their fair share of city
services during their stay in Del Mar AND to ensure the continued financial health
of your community.

Please join us in voting “Yes” on Proposition H .

Argument Against Proposition H

THE CITY COUNCIL COULD GIVE UP $300,000 OF THE NEW TOURIST
OCCUPANCY TAX (TOT) ANNUALLY TO BENEFIT HOTELS: VOTE "NO" ON
PROPOSITION H.

The council's ballot argument disguises the true beneficiaries of new hotel-generated
taxes and fees. The voters are not being told the entire story, The ballot measure does
not reveal a last-minute sleight-of-hand regarding potential unavailability to the City of
the full 13% of tax money. Hoteliers gained the concession that if they impose a TMD
(Tourist Marketing District) fee, that fee would be considered when raising the TOT so
as to keep the total of TOT and TMD fee competitive with those paid in neighboring
cities. This concession to the Del Mar hoteliers, codified by a newly amended
ordinance, could reduce the TOT revenue to the City by as much as $300,000 annually,
money that instead would be available to the hoteliers for marketing themselves.

While the ballot measure promises that every TOT dollar will be paid by visitors and
"stays in . Del Mar," the revised wording of the ordinance introduced by the Council
majority will potentially divert huge sums to the hotels to be administered by a private
corporation and limit the City’s take to less than 13%.

The Council has been generally dismissive of the sincere, well-reasoned and
unanimous urgings of residents who argued to the Council that we have pressing
infrastructure needs: a sewer pump station, a lifeguard headquarters, unmet obligations
to pay for the Shores site, to name a few. Residents argued and we concur: Why
should hoteliers get a sum equal to half the City’s annual public improvement budget?

Tell the City Council to use the full 13% TOT revenue to provide services for our
community’s needs.

To send this message, vote "NO" on Proposition H.
