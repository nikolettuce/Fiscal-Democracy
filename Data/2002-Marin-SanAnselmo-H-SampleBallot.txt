ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE H

Since 1983, the. voters in the Ross Valley have overwhelmingly approved
a special tax to provide paramedic service. To continue this high
standard'of emergency medical care for four more years, you must now
re-approve this measure.

The RVPA chargps for ambulance transport in order to continue to fund
this improved service without increasing the current tax. This is the :
Standard that ALL other paramedic provider agencies within Marin.
County work under. This transport charge will be billed to insurance
providers, such as Medi-Cal, Medicare, and private insurance carriers.

The fecial tax. covers the base level services, including dedicated
paramedic ambulances in the, Ross Valley, 9-1-1 responses,
defibrillators, Paramedic and Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) .'
training. The transport charge covers the cost of transporting patients to ,
the hospital.: The actual tax will be. determined each year. A "YES” vote :
for this measure does not increase the tax, which has been $30.00 per .
living unit for the past eleven years.

The goal of the Fire Chiefs of the Ross Valley is to continuously improve
: paramedic services and response times.

We need YOUR vote to continue this vital service. Vote “YES" on .
Measure “H".
