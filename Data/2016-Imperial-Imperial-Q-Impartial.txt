CITY ATTORNEY IMPARTIAT ANALYSIS OF BALLOT MEASURE "Q

13.a

The City of El Centro imposes a transient occupancy tax (“TOT”), also called a “room” tax, at
the rate of ten percent (10%) of the rent paid by guests for the ability to occupy a room or other space in
a hotel or other similar accommodation for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes (collectively
“occupancy” and a “hotel”) for a period of thirty (30) consecutive days or less. This TOT currently is
imposed upon paying hotel guests for the ability to occupy a room or other hotel space and collected by
the hotel operator.

The City Council has placed Measure “Q” on the ballot by unanimous vote. Passage of Measure
"Q" would amend the City’s Municipal Code as follows:

•	Effective April 1, 2017, increase the TOT rate from ten percent (10%) to thirteen percent
(13%) of the rent paid by guests for hotel occupancy. Because the tax is a general tax, its
proceeds may be used for any City general governmental purpose, including but not limited
to fire and police services; street operations and maintenance; library and parks and
recreation facilities and services. The rate increase may generate up to an additional
$480,000 per year.

•	Clarify that when a guest occupies a hotel for longer than 30 consecutive days, the TOT will
apply only to the first 30 days of occupancy;

•	Clarify that the ordinance applies to online travel companies and other third parties as hotel
“operators” who must collect the TOT from guests who purchase hotel occupancy on the
internet;

•	Clarify that taxable rent paid for a hotel occupancy includes all rates and fees commonly
charged including room rates, parking fees, cancellation charges, and online booking fees, but
excludes charges for food and beverages;

•	Provide that for “block reservation” arrangements the period of taxable occupancy is
measured by the length of an individual guest’s stay, not the length of the “block reservation”
entered into by the guest’s employer or agent; and

•	Clarify exemptions from the TOT for state and federal employees.

Measure "Q" must be approved by a majority of the votes cast by the City voters who vote on the
ballot proposition.

A “yes” vote on Measure "Q" will authorize the amendments to the City’s Municipal Code
described above.

A “no” vote on Measure "Q" will prohibit the City from adopting the amendments to its
Municipal Code as described above and the TOT will remain in place at ten percent (10%) until
otherwise revised by a majority vote of the voters.
