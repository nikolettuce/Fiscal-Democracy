Ballot question

The following question appeared on the ballot:[i]

Shall Section 3.16.020 of Chapter 3.16 of the Soledad Municipal Code be
amended to increase the existing transient occupancy tax, charged only to
occupants of City hotels, from nine percent (9%) to twelve percent (12%),
increasing the tax collected by an estimated $20,000 for a new estimated
annual total of $100,000, with no termination date, to continue to provide
funding for essential services such as police, fire, street repair, park
maintenance and community programs?[2]

Impartial analysis

The following impartial analysis of the measure was prepared by the office of the

Soledad City Attorney:

The City Council of the City of Soledad has placed Measure F on the
November 8, 2016 Consolidated Statewide Election ballot to ask the
voters to consider approval of an ordinance that would amend section
3.16.030 of Chapter 3.16 of the Soledad Municipal Code by increasing the
rate of the City’s Transient Occupancy Tax from nine percent (9%) to
twelve percent (12%). The City’s Transient Occupancy Tax has remained
at 9% since 1992. It is collected from and paid only by those persons
staying at hotels, as defined in the Code, within the City for thirty days or
less and is not paid by the City’s property owners.

The revenues generated by the Transient Occupancy Tax are deposited
in the City’s General Fund and can be used for a variety of essential
government services, such as police, fire safety, recreation, park and road
maintenance, and youth programs. As such, this ballot measure is a
“general tax” rather than a “special tax” and requires a simple majority
vote for adoption. Staff has estimated that if the proposed increased

Transient Occupancy Tax is adopted, the City will collect an additional
$20,000 a year for a new estimated annual total of $100,000.

A “yes” vote on Measure F is a vote to increase the City’s Transient
Occupancy Tax to 12%. A “no” vote is a vote against the increase.
Measure F would be approved if it receives a simple majority (over 50%)
of “yes” votes.[2]
