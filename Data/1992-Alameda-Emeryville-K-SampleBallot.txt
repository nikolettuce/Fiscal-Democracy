CITY OF EMERYVILLE MEASURE	
U MEASURE K: Shall the decision of the Emeryville City Council to supplement the annual assessment for emergency medical services in the amount of twelve dollars for each benefited ^ unit for Fiscal Year 1992-93 be ratified for collection in successive years?	YES
	NO

CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE K

In 1983 the voters of Alameda County created the Emergency Medical Services District. The County assesses a flat rate
county-wide, and each City Council has the power to increase the rate by approving supplemental assessments to support
the work of the District. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) assessments are shown on yearly property tax bills.

In April, the Emeryville City Council passed Resolution 92-65 imposing a supplemental assessment of $12.00 per
benefited unit for the 1992-1993 tax year. Each residential dwelling is assessed as one benefited unit; commer-
cial/industrial uses are assessed in accordance with size and usage. The City Council also requested that the endorsement
of this supplemental assessment for subsequent years be placed before the voters in the November election.

This ballot measure will not affect the Council’s action in April. The County has already included next year’s
supplemental assessment on the property tax rolls for 1992-1993. This measure does affect whether this Sl.OO/month
charge will be levied in subsequent years.

A YES vote will endorse the City Council’s decision to support enhanced Emergency Medical Services (EMS) and
approve a permanent supplemental assessment of $1.00/month.

A NO vote is a vote against enhanced Emergency Medical Services and will result in the removal of the $1.00/month
supplemental assessment from the property tax bill for 1993-1994.

THE ABOVE STATEMENT IS AN IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE K. IF YOU DESIRE INFORMA-
TION CONCERNING THIS MEASURE, PLEASE CALL THE ELECTIONS OFFICIAL’S OFFICE AT (510)
596-4373 AND AVAILABLE INFORMATION WILL BE MAILED AT NO COST TO YOU.

<	ARGUMENT	IN	FAVOR	OF	MEASURE K

The Emeryville Fire Department provides quality emergency medical services to the people of Emeryville. A YES vote
will affirm the City Council’s decision to provide essential safety equipment and services as follows:

•	DISASTER AND FIRST AID RESCUE EQUIPMENT

•	CPR TRAINING

•	PUBLIC EDUCATION PROGRAMS FOR ADULTS AND SCHOOL CHILDREN

•	AIDS AWARENESS TRAINING

•	CITIZENS ACTION RESPONSE TO EMERGENCIES (CARE) PROGRAM

•	BLOOD PRESSURE MONITORING

Over the past 5 years, most cities in the County have charged their residents a supplemental fee for emergency medical
services. At $1.00 per month, Emeryville's rate would still be one of the lowest in the County. The assessment will allow
the Fire Department to meet the challenges of the next disaster and provide quality emergency medical services.

The Emeryville City Council believes that enhanced emergency services are important, and they have voted to
approve supplemental funding for the current year. We need to continue to provide these valuable services in the
future. Vote YES for emergency medical services in Emeryville.
