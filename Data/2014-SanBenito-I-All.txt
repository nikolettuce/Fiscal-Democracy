WHEREAS, San Benito County Code Section 5.03.052 currently establishes an eight
percent (8%) tax for the privilege of occupancy in any hotel by a transient within the

PROPOSED ORDINANCE

ORDINANCE NO.

AN ORDINANCE OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OF THE COUNTY OF SAN
BENITO, STATE OF CALIFORNIA, AMENDING THE SAN BENITO COUNTY CODE
TO INCREASE THE TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX TO A RATE OF TWELVE
PERCENT (12%), AMENDING THE DEFINTION OF OPERATOR TO CHARGE THE
TAX ON ALL PERSON RECEIVING REVENUE FROM HOTEL OCCUPANCY (SUCH
AS ON-LINE HOTEL BROKERS AND VACATION RENTAL AGENCIES)

THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTY OF SAN BENITO ORDAIN AS FOLLOWS:

SECTION I: Section 5.03.052 of the San Benito County Code is hereby set forth for voter
approval to read as follows:

§ 5.03.052 TAX IMPOSED.

A tax of twelve percent (12%) is levied and imposed on all rent paid to the operator of any hotel
in the unincorporated area of San Benito County, by any transient for renting, using, or
occupying a room or rooms in those hotels, to be paid and collected as provided in this Article.
The tax shall constitute a debt owed by the transient and the operator to the County, which debt
shall be extinguished only by payment to the operator, and then to the County. The transient
shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in
installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax
shall be due upon the transient’s ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax
due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the Tax Administrator may require that the tax be
paid directly to the Tax Administrator.

SECTION II: The definition of “Operator” contained in Section 5.03.051 of the San Benito
County Code is hereby set forth for voter approval to read as follows:

OPERATOR. “Operator” means any person:

(1)	possessing or having an ownership interest in a hotel, or who is the proprietor of the
hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession,
licensee or any other capacity;

(2)	engaged in the business of operating a hotel; or

(3)	receiving any consideration for the rental of a hotel room for sleeping
accommodations, including, without limitation, any broker, service provider, or other
intermediary:

(i)	with which a hotel has contracted to arrange for the rental of a hotel room
for sleeping accommodations; or

(ii)	that has acquired any hotel room for subsequent rental from the hotel for
sleeping accommodations.

131914.1

Where the operator performs his or her functions through a managing agent of any type
or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an
operator for the purposes of this article and shall have the same duties and liabilities as
his or her principal. Compliance with the provisions of this article by either the principal
or the managing agent, however, shall be considered to be compliance by both.

SECTION III. TRANSITION PERIOD. In the interim period between the November 4, 2014
election and December 31, 2014, for the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is
subject to and shall pay tax in the amount of 8% of the rent charged by the operator. The
increase to twelve percent pursuant to Section 1 and the amendment to Section 5.03.051 as
specified in Section 2, above, shall be effective January 1,2015.

SECTION IV; NATURE OF TAX. If approved by the majority of the electorate voting on the
measure, the ordinance will increase the current transient occupancy tax rate to twelve (12%) of
rent charged. The transient occupancy tax is imposed upon transients for the privilege of
occupying defined hotels located within the unincorporated territory of San Benito County. The
tax would be collected by hotel operators primarily in the same manner as the current transient
occupancy tax is collected, except that the tax may now also be collected from on-line hotel
brokers and vacation rental agencies. The collection of the tax from hotel operators would be
administered by the Auditor of San Benito County, as provided in Article III, of Chapter 5.03 of
the San Benito County Code.

SECTION V: GENERAL TAX, The transient occupancy tax imposed by this ordinance is a
general tax within the meaning of Government Code Section 53721 and Article XIIIC, Section
1 (a) of the California Constitution. The revenue generated by this general tax is available for
general governmental purposes. To that end, the Auditor-Controller is instructed to deposit the
revenue from the tax into the County General Fund and to include his/her estimate of the revenue
from this general tax, together with his estimates of other revenue sources, in the tabulation that
the is annually required to prepare by Government Code Section 29060. The revenue from this
general tax shall be made available to the Board of Supervisors for annual appropriation in the
County’s budget for any lawful expenditure. Nothing in this ordinance or in any other ordinance,
advisory measure, resolution, or policy shall be construed as limiting, in any way, the amount or
the objects of the appropriations and expenditures that can be made from the revenue of the tax,
nor be construed as creating a continuing appropriation.

SECTION VI: COMPLIANCE WITH THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL
QUALITY ACT (CEQA). Pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15378(b) (4), adoption of this
tax increase ordinance as a government funding mechanism is not a project subject to the
requirements of CEQA. Prior to commencement of any project that may result from the
expenditure of revenues from this tax increase, any necessary environmental review required by
CEQA shall be completed.

131914.1

SECTION VII: SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this ordinance or the application thereof
to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the ordinance and the application
of such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.

SECTION VIII: ELECTION. Voter approval of this ordinance shall have the effect of
increasing the transient occupancy tax and making the change to the definition of “Operator”. If
the measure is defeated, the transient occupancy tax will remain at the existing transient
occupancy rate of eight percent (8%) and the San Benito County Code remains unchanged.

SECTION IX. EFFECTIVE DATE AND CODIFICATION. This ordinance shall take effect
immediately upon its adoption by a majority of the electorate voting on the ordinance at the
November 4,2014 general election. Upon adoption, Sections I and II of this ordinance shall be
codified; the remaining sections shall not be codified. As set forth in Section III, the increase to
twelve percent (12%) and the change to the definition of “Operator” shall be effective January 1,
2015.

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE I BY THE
SAN BENITO COUNTY COUNSEL’S OFFICE

This analysis of the changes to the Transient Occupancy Tax, Measure I, is prepared and
submitted in accordance with Elections Code Section 9160. This measure was placed on the
ballot by a vote of the San Benito County Board of Supervisors.

State law allows San Benito County to impose a transient occupancy tax on short tenn occupants
of hotels, motels, inns or other lodging. The transient occupancy tax (sometimes referred to as
“hotel tax”) is a tax on the nightly room rent paid by visitors staying in hotels, motels, inns or
other lodging in the unincorporated area of San Benito County for stays of thirty consecutive
days or less.

If approved, the measure adopts an ordinance to amend the San Benito County Code to increase
the Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) from the current rate of eight (8) percent to twelve (12)
percent, and expands the definition of “operator” in Section 5.03.051 of the San Benito County
Code.

By way of example, if this measure is approved, for a room that costs $ 100 per night, the tax due
would increase from $8.00 to $12.00 per night. The tax rate was last increased in 1986.

The definition of “Operator” would also be modified to include any person receiving
consideration (such as money) for rental of a hotel room including any broker, service provider
or other intermediary which the hotel has contracted to arrange for the rental of the room or that
has acquired any hotel room for subsequent rental. This will allow the TOT to be collected from
on-line hotel brokers and vacation rental agencies when the hotel room is rented through such
means. Currently, the tax is collected from the hotel proprietors (such as an owner) or managing
agents and not from hotel booking providers.

A “Yes” vote amends the definition of operator and increases the tax rate to 12%.

A. “No” vote results in no changes in the current Transient Occupancy Tax,

To be approved, Measure I requires a majority approval, of the voters at a general election.

Argument in Favor of Measure “ T ”

San Benito County's Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) commonly called the "hotel tax" is paid by those 1 ‘"'J
who rent hotel rooms in San Benito County. The current hotel room TOT is 8%. This measure would raise I
the hotel room tax to 12%, as well as allow the tax to be collected from on-line hotel brokers and	ft	V

vacation rental agencies. Measure J7_ enables tourists to pay for the services they receive while visiting |
our community by only a small increase in cost for each visitor.	f

The County needs revenues to provide the services and programs the community expects. The TOT is a
beneficial way to produce new revenue from tourists, visitors, and business travelers who use County
services. San Benito County has not raised the TOT since 1985. The proposed increase of 4% brings the
County's tax in line with San Juan Bautista and many other neighboring cities and counties. With this
increase, TOT will raise approximately 1.3 million dollars for vital county services over the next ten
years.

Specifically Measure X' will:

3

•	Be paid for by Tourists. Measure 1 requires hotel and motel guests to pay an additional 4%
on their room rates. County residents living in their homes will not have their taxes affected in
any way by this measure.

•	Help the County's budget crisis. Measure X will make available over $130,000 every year
making funding available for tourism promotion, parks and recreation, and vital county services
such as public safety, fire and paramedic response.

Unlike property tax and sales tax, which are collected by the State of California, this local tax can't be
taken away by the State. The proceeds of the TOT stay right here in our community I This tax is paid
entirely by visitors at no cost to residents,
