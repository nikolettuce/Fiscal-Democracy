

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
CITY OF CALIFORNIA CITY
MEASUREC

Measure C is a special tax measure of the City of California City. If this measure
is approved by two-thirds of the voters, the city will be able to levy a special tax
for three years commencing July 1,2001. The maximum amount of tax the city
can levy is $75 per lot or parcel per year. The city will use proceeds of the special
tax to pay for police, fire and recreational services, and to repair streets, parks,
sewers and building maintenance.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR:
CITY OF CALIF

California City has made a strong comobadk OVOr the past three years. Our
community coming together, supporting The Special tax and our City Council,
made this possible. We have not completed all that needs to be done. Our police
and fire departments still need our direct support to maintain the level of service
we currently have. The sewer system and water treatment facility expansions still
need to be completed. Our street repair Is never ending and resurfacing is not
complete. We need to come together again and continue the work that we started.
Without continuing the special tax these projects cannot be completed. We do
not have a business or manufacturing base large enough to provide an income
to support our needs, as yet. Our City management Is working hard to draw in
this business and manufacturing base, but that base will not develop without the
infrastructure to support it. We need to continue the special tax, continue the work
started and complete rebuilding our infrastructure. This will help the City manage-
ment bring in the manufacturing and business base to provide our City a strong
income. Vote yes on Measure "CH and continue our community's growth.
