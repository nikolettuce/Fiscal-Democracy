SEC. 551. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

Human consumption of Sugar-Sweetened Beverages ) linked to a myriad
health problems including, but not Umited tin weight sain, obesity coronary heart disease diabetes,
cavities^ tooth, decay, and other health problems. Scientific evidence shows that underlying these
chronic health problems is metabolic syndrome	[MetS}is characterized by changes in a body’s

nojjnal	biochemistry thatcan lead to obesity insulin resistance, hypertension, dysliuidemia (high

cholesterol). and visceral fat. SSBs are linked to excess weight and obesity which are putting more

Americans on the path to MetS. Heavy added sugar consumption may itself be a direct cause of MetS j

by increasing the risk for hypertension, dyslipidemia and visceral fat, WhUe most people with. MetS are i

j

obese, normal-weight individuals can acquire the syndrome as well, given poor dietary, habits. Heavy j

consumption of susarv drinks hasbeen linked to MetS_ through a variety, of biological pathways,,
therefore a risk factor in chronic disease.

The 2010 HS. Dietary Guidelines for Americans report that sugary drinks	single

greatest source of added sugar in the American diet, constituting 36.6 percent of added sugars topically
consumed, making them an ideal target for public health protections. Sugar-sweetened soda, and
drinks conjoining less than 100 percent juice by volume, are major sources ojfaddedsugars in
Aniencgn diets. contributing an average of 10.58 teaspoons ofjadded sugars each dap. The American
Heart Association recommends that adult wornen consume no more than six teaspoons	sugars

daily, that adult men consume no more than rune teaspoand that children consume no more thpn
three teaspoons of added sugars	('notincluding naturally occurring sugars in whole foods such as fndt

andplain milk} per day, which is about 50 calories.	. most Americans consunie more	than

19.6 teaspoons ofpdded sugars per dap. Even	regular, moderate consumption of sugary drinks (one

Trounce can a dap) increases the risk of cardiovascular disease mortality bp nearly one third.

Obese children suffer more often from sleep a. , joint problems, fatty liver .
gallstones, and acjd reflux [heartburn). Obese children are more likely to become obese . further
increasing their risks for higher rates ofjype 2 diabetes, heart disease, and some cappers later in life.
Profound mental health and Quality, oflife impacts are seen in children with, severe obesity. As
nearly one-third	[3L7_percent)	ofphildren and adolescents in San	were either obese or

overweight. Among adults, consumption ofSSBs is associated with, a risk	gain	and	.

cgrdjpygscular disease, a	significantly higher risk of stroke, high blood	type 2 diabetes,

dental erosion, and the risk ofpancrcatic capper. In 2077-20/2. 41.8 percent	in

San Francisco were either obese or overweight.

Low-income	{applies	are	more	likely	to	be	greeted	by	obesity	and	diabetes,	For example,	j

four-year-olds enrolled in San Francisco Head Start were obese, with an additional 13 percent being
overweight. Head Start serves children of low-income families.

According to the American Dental Association, a steady diet of sugary foods and drinks,
including juice and sports drinks, can damage teeth. Cavity-causing bacteria in the mouth feed on
sugar and produce acids that attack tooth enamel for up to 20 minutes after eating or drinking. Sipping
sugary beverages or eating sugary foods all day results in repeated acid attacks that weaken tooth
enamel and lead to cavities. In extreme cases, softer enamel combined with improper brushing.
grinding of the teeth, or other conditions can lead to tooth loss.

The annual cost of being overweight and obese to California families, employers, the health
care industry. and the government is estimated to be $21 billion. The San Francisco Budget and
Legislative Analyst estimates that up to $61.8 million in costs incurred by San Franciscans with obesity
and diabetes are attributable to sugary beverage consumption. The total national cost of diabetes in
2007 was $174 billion.

Research shows that lifestyle interventions are more cost-effective than medications in
preventing or delaying type 2 diabetes. SSBs have been targeted as part of a tax policy to reduce
caloric intake, improve diet and health, and generate revenue that governments can use to address ?
obesity-related health and economic burdens. The Institute of Medicine and other beverage tax
advocates suggest that tax revenues could be used to promote healthier eating and reduce or prevent
obesity. In 2009. the Institute of Medicine recommended that local governments implement a tax
strategy for calorie-dense. nutrient-poor food and beverages to discourage consumption. Likewise, in
2010. the White House Task Force on Childhood Obesity recommended that federal, state, and local

governments analyze the effects of taxes on less healthy, energy-dense foods, such as SSBs.	j

}

i

The purpose of taxing SSBs is to make San Franciscans healthier by discouraging consumption j

i

of the main source of added dietary sugars, and by raising funds to support health promotion and ■

i

obesity prevention, particularly targeting children in San Francisco’s low-income communities. Plain i

most appropriate beverages for healthy children older than the age	Yet,	17.2 percent of

San Francisco children and	adolescentsconsume two or more glasses	or sugary drink per day.

Within this, there are significant variations by ethnicity with 24.2 percent ofAsian and 33.9 percent of
Latino. and only 4A percent of white children, consuming two or more glasses ofjoda or sugary drink
per day. On average. chUdren consumed 11.96 teaspoons	sugars from sodas and drinks

per day — 47 percent	oftheir total intake of added sugars. A single 12-ounce can ofjoda contains eight

to ten teaspoons of sugar, and typical container sizes of popular sugary drinks marketed to children far
exceed recommended amomts.

Assessing a tax on SSBs is intended to help address the high levels of obesity, type 2 diabetes
and other diseases by reducing consumption and providing a revenue stream for City-directed and
srant-funded physical activity and nutrition programs in	.	parks,	community	centers,	and

through comtnunity-based organizations.
