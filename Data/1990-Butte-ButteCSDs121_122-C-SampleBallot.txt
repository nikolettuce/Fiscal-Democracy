IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL
MEASURE C
COUNTY SERVICE AREA 122-
FIRE SUPPRESSION ASSESSMENT

The Fire Suppression Assessment Measure is being submitted to the voters
within the boundaries of proposed Service Area 122 pursuant to existing law.
It would not change the existing law.

If a majority of the voters cast on both this measure and on Measure "B”
pertaining to the establishment of County Service Area 122 are "Yes”, then
the Board of Supervisors may adopt an ordinance levying a fire suppression
assessment. The text of the ordinance which would be adopted is as contain-
ed in the Fire Suppression Assessment Report adopted by the Board of
Supervisors on August 29, 1989. The assessment would be in accordance
with said report and with Board of Supervisors Resolution No. 89-145.

The assessment would commence with the 1990-91 fiscal year. It would be
levied only upon property within County Service Area 122 with combustible or
flammable improvements valued at SI ,500 or more as shown on the latest
Assessor's rolls. The maximum permissible assessment for the 1990-91
fiscal year would be as follows:

Description (Structure Type)	Maximum 1990-91 Assessment

Residential:

Single family	S	67.92

Multi-family	33.96

(per dwelling unit)

Commercial:	135.84

Industrial:	339.60

Agricultural:	84.90

Institutional:	84.90

Miscellaneous:	67.92

Commencing with fiscal year 1991-92 the maximum permissible assess-
ment shall be adjusted by a percentage equal to the percentage increase in
Butte County’s spending limit pursuant to Section 1 of Article XIII.B. of the
California Constitution (Gann limit). During the 11 years for which such
spending limit has been calculated (fiscal years 1979-80 through 1989-90),

the average annual increase was 8.80%. The average increase for the five
years ending 1989-90 was 6.38%. It is not known what the percentage
increase will be in future years.

The assessment shall be collected in the same manner as county property
taxes are collected. Any funds collected from the assessment could only be
expended for fire suppression services within County Service Area 122.

If a majority of the votes on this measure or on Measure "B" are "No”,
then the Board of Supervisors cannot adopt the ordinance levying the fire
suppression assessment.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Ordinance or
Measure C. If you desire a copy ot the ordinance or measure,
please call the elections officials office at 538-7761 and a copy
will be mailed at no cost to you.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE C

Take the battle out of fire protection! Eliminate the annual agony over how
many and which fire stations must be closed. Keep your fire insurance rates
from skyrocketing! By voting YES on Measure C, you will give your Fire
Department a permanent funding base that cannot be diverted to any other
use. This funding base cannot be increased over the Gann Spending Limit.

Our 60 fire engines are expected to last 100 years at the current replace-
ment rate. You know that isn't possible! A YES vote on this measure will
allow your firefighters to acquire new reliable fire engines tor our full-time and
volunteer fire stations. Your volunteers will also begin to receive greatly
improved repair service through the use of mobile fire mechanics. Your 14
full-time engine companies will be able to respond out of the stations within
90 seconds of your call for help.

Your Fire Department is a caring and hardworking group of your neigh-
bors. We hope you think the service we would bring to you is worth the 19
cents per day this measure could cost to protect your home and family

Please mark your ballot YES on Measure C. The life or home you save
could be your own.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE C

There is no credible proof that fire insurance rates will increase if Measure
C fails. Passage simply increases your tax burden and assesses the same fee
to a remote residence, that won't be saved, as it does to one next to the fire
station.

Examination of equipment acquisitions shows that the volunteer depart-
ments regularly acquire equipment without tax funding. A new tax that will
cause rural residents to subsidize fire service for the urban areas is not the
solution. Existing fire companies should be allowed to form fire protection
districts so that the support level and amount of tax can be controlled by local
people in the district.

The proposed tax is the result of the failure of county administrators to plan
ahead and explore other solutions. This tax is a fundamental shift of the tax
burden and nothing else.

The state is exploring solutions to county problems and numerous bills are
in the legislature. If Measure C passes you will continue to pay the tax even if
Sacramento provides financial assistance and even if a complete solution to
county fund shortages is found. Other solutions will be adopted.

VOTE NO ON MEASURE C!

ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE C

DEFEAT MEASURE C.

Last September property owners resoundingly opposed the imposition of
an assessment for fire suppression assessments without a vote. The assess-
ment would replace funding from general tax revenues and provide a way to
substantially increase the per parcel cost of paying for county services. This
need for a new source of revenue results from services mandated by the State
but not adequately funded.

Since September the State has examined County operations, determined
that many problems were caused by the State and should be State funded.
Steps have been taken to provide relief. Payment to the State for fire service
has been delayed. Bills have been introduced into the legislature to provide
State funding and to increase County share of property tax revenues. State
actions are the result of taxpayer opposition to an increasing burden.

Several outstanding volunteer fire departments exist in the County. These
can be the nucleus of fire protection districts that would give local control of
tax authority and use. Assessments would be approved at District level and be
related to the benefit.

Measure C would assess the same fee to residences of different value and
receiving different benefits. Residential fires in remote locations usually result
in total destruction, as do fires in lower value homes.

Service provided, and to be provided, vary substantially throughout the
county. Benefit to specific residences varies substantially. It is unrealistic to
suggest that benefit to specific residences is not related to location and value.
This measure would result in owners of homes receiving little benefit subsi-
dizing fire protection.

Defeat Measure C and insist that County develop plans based on new State
actions and promoting greater local control of fire services

DEFEAT MEASURE C.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE C

PLEASE VOTE YES ON MEASURE C.

For sixty years your firefighters have worked very hard to develop a strong,
consolidated Fire Department to serve you. We are proud of the service we
provide to every community and of the insurance rating we have achieved.
We are proud that we have been able to make every one of your dollars go as
far as humanly possible.

Now, due to circumstances beyond our controLafl of this js at risk.
Mandates and law suits have wiped out our funding. Our fire engines are
falling apart and your insurance rating is teetering in th&balance.

It is argued that we provide vastly different levels of service throughout the
County. That is simply untrue. The number of fire engines sent to each type of
emergency is identical everywhere. Less than 1% of the population is over 8
minutes from the nearest fire station. The two main insurance ratings are
primarily distinguished by the existence of fire hydrants.

To suggest that we respond less vigorously to lower value homes demeans
those firefighters who risk their lives day after day combatting these emergen-
cies. The precarious position of fire protection in this County would be
destroyed by forming twenty new fire protection bureaucracies. None would
be able to handle a significant fire with their limited resources and their
inevitable financial weakness would lead to unending turf battles.

Please join with us in keeping fire services as a top priority by voting YES
on Measure C.
