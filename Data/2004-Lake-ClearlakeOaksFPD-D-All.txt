IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF CLEARLAKE
OAKS FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT
MEASURE“D”

California law authorizes the governing board of a local
fire protection district to impose a special tax for fire pro-
tection and prevention services. Such a special tax must
be levied on a parcel, class of improvement to property,
or use of property basis, or a combination thereof and
such property must have available to it the fire protec-
tion services provided by the district, such tax is to be
used for obtaining, furnishing, operation and maintaining
fire suppression equipment or apparatus, for paying the
salaries and benefits to firefighting personnel or such
other necessary fire protection and prevention expenses
of the district, and for no other purpose. The ordinance
imposing this special tax, as adopted by the governing
body of the district, may provide for a maximum amount
of tax to be levied upon such parcel, class of improve-
ment to property, or use of property basis, or combina-
tion thereof, and permit the governing board of the dis-
trict to determine the amount of tax to be levied, annual-
ly, within the maximum amount. An ordinance imposing
such a special tax must be approved by two-thirds of the
voters voting upon the measure within the district. This
is such a measure.

This measure, if approved by two-thirds of the voters
voting thereon, will approve of the action of the Board of
Directors of the Clearlake Oaks Fire Protection District
to impose a special tax, as determined annually by the
Board of Directors, but, not to exceed two dollars
($2.00) per unit of benefit per year pursuant to the Units
of Benefit Table set forth in the measure, such tax to be
imposed on all parcels within the District for the purpose
of providing fire protection and prevention services
(salaries and benefits of firefighting personnel, neces-
sary fire protection and prevention services, medical aid,
ambulance service and hazardous materials).

This measure is authorized by and is in conformity with
the existing laws of the State of California.

A yes vote on this measure will approve the action of
the District’s Board of Directors to impose a special tax
on all real property in the District for fire protection and
prevention and related services.

A no vote on this measure will disapprove the action of
the District’s Board of Directors to impose such a spe-
cial tax.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE D

This tax has not increased since 1987. Costs of medical
supplies, fuel and equipment maintenance have
increased substantially since 1987. Also, the population
of the district has grown resulting in more demand for
services. The district did not have any paramedics or
ambulance service in 1987. Now paramedic service is
provided 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. The operating
costs have exceeded the revenue and the reserves
have been depleted.

If Measure “D“ is not passed, some of the effects would
be:

Decrease of ambulance service
Termination of some paid staff
Longer response time
Increase in home owner insurance policy
premiums

Vote “Yes” On Measure “D” and help your fire district
continue to serve your community with the excellent
fire/emergency protection you deserve.

A “Yes” vote is for you, your family and your com-
munity!!!

1.	Section 4 of Article XIIIA of the California Constitution permits special

districts by two-thirds vote of their qualified electorate to impose a special
tax on property and Health and Safety Code Section 13913 authorizes a
fire protection district to impose a special tax pursuant to Government
Code Section 53978 for fire protection and prevention services.

2.	It is the purpose of this Ordinance to authorize the levy of a special tax on
parcels of real property on the secured property tax rolls of Lake County
that are within the Clearlake Oaks Fire Protection District in order to
augment funding for fire protection, prevention, medical aid, rescue
service and hazardous materials. Because the burden of this tax falls on
property, it is a property tax but it is not determined according to nor is it
in any manner based on the value of the property. This tax is based, to
the extent practical, upon the risk of fire or the need for rescue service to
each parcel and the improvements thereon. Insofar as not inconsistent
with this Ordinance, such provisions of the California Revenue and
Taxation Code as related to ad valorem property taxes are intended to
apply to the collection and administration of this tax. As to authorized by
Government Code Section 53978, this tax is not an ad valorem tax, die
exemptions contained in or authorized by Article XIII of the California
Constitution shall not apply.

The revenues raised by this tax are to be used solely for the purposes of
obtaining, furnishing, operating, and maintaining fire suppression
equipment or apparatus, for paying the salaries and benefits of fire
fighting personnel and for other necessary fire protection and prevention,
and for providing medical aid, rescuer service and hazardous materials
