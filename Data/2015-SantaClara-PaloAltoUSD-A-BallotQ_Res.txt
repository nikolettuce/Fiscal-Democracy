RECOMMENDATION

Pending the results of the discussion at this meeting, it will be recommended at the next meeting of the
Board of Education, that a public hearing be held regarding this resolution and also that the Board of
Education approve the ballot language for a parcel tax to be placed on the May 5,2015, ballot. Changes to
this item are noted in bold italics or bold italics strikethrough (page 2,3,4).

BACKGROUND

The current parcel tax expires after the end of the 2015-16 fiscal year. The current tax started in July 2010
and is for six years. The tax started at $589 per parcel in 2010 and has a two percent annual escalator and
allows senior exemptions. The current rate for 2014-15 is $638 per parcel. The revenue from this parcel tax
is an estimated $12.4 million for 2014-15. This is 7% of the District budget and so there is a need to renew
it. Specifically, the current parcel tax enables us to:

•	Preserve excellence in core academic programs such as reading, writing, math, and science;

•	Minimize class size increases in all grades and layoffs of teachers and school employees;

•	Continue teacher professional development by providing training programs and activities that
support high quality teaching;

•	Provide up-to-date textbooks and instructional materials for students;

•	Help protect critical high school course offerings and electives that challenge students, allow
students to be highly competitive for colleges and university admissions, provide career vocational
education that prepares students for the workforce, and provide instructional support for those
struggling with the basics;

•	Increase counseling support to students;

•	Reduce the impact of deep budget cuts by providing a stable local funding source that cannot be
taken away by the state or other school districts;

Moreover, since the last economic downturn in 2008, our per student operating funding has risen by 8%,
that is at a slower rate than the 13% increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). During the same period,
student enrollment has increased by approximately 1,100 and is projected to grow by more than 700
students over the next five years. Although property taxes have risen in recent years, we have faced more
than a $10 million reduction in our general operating funds as the result of reductions in funding from the
state, a reduction in our lease revenues, and a substantial increase in annual pension costs mandated by
state law. Expiration of the parcel tax would result in deep cuts to educational programs that are important
to students and valued by the community.

1

In early December, a community poll with a sample size of 402 was administered in order to test the
willingness of the community to vote to renew and also to increase the parcel tax amount in order to
implement new programs and/or to expand certain existing programs, the results of the poll are shown in
Attachment A.

The poll tested an additional tax in the range of $48 to $120 per parcel. The poll shows that any amount in
the range tested could reach the 2/3 required majority. A $120 additional tax would generate approximately
$2.3 million in additional revenue. At the Board study session on December 17,2014, the board reviewed
the results of the survey and the majority of members expressed support to renew the tax with an additional
amount of $120 per parcel.

The District made budget cuts from 2009 to 2012. As the economy started to recover and property tax
growth got back on a healthy track, the District was able to gradually apply the additional resources to
address some critical needs throughout the Districts. However, there are not sufficient new ongoing
resources to invest in new programs. With the proposed parcel tax increase, the District will be able to
invest in new programs that the community has indicated are important and valued.

To assure our vision to “support all PAUSD students as they prepare themselves to thrive as global citizens
in a rapidly changing world” becomes a reality, we foresee investing in three areas: 1) assuring equitable
opportunities and access to a comprehensive, innovative, and robust curriculum and instruction that will
prepare students for college and careers, including those that do not yet exist in fields we have yet to
discover; 2) increasing innovative science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)
programming for all students; and 3) fostering student physical, psychological, and social-emotional
wellness. As we learned at the Board’s December 17 study session, there is significant community support
for these three areas.

While some new programs, services, and opportunities would replace existing practices, most would
require additional staff, materials, and equipment. Specifically, we are asking the community to support an
increase in the parcel tax that will enable us to address, at least in part, these top priorities within each
of the three areas. (The wording of the bullet point list in the enclosed resolution includes
references to what the current parcel tax funds, as well as a broad overview of what the new one
would fund. The language below is more specific than that in the resolution.) accomplish some of
the following program improvements. Please note that a parcel tax increase is not adequate to fund
all or even most of the items on the list, and staff will be identifying the

1.	Equitable Opportunities and access for all youth to excel at the highest levels.

The Minority Achievement and Talent Development Advisory Committee will be preparing a list of strategic
recommendations to close the achievement gap and to assure that students have access and opportunities
to the full range of our rich curriculum and extracurricular activities, and while these have yet to be finalized,
the list may well be likely to include:

•	Extended Summer School expansion

•	PK-2 Literacy Support Expanded intense early (PK-2) literacy support and intervention

•	Expert tutoring across multiple grades and subjects

•	After school and Saturday weekend programming and services

•	Transportation to assure students can access after school and weekend programs

•	Support for Buena Vista students if (or when) displaced

2

2.	Innovative STEAM Initiatives Programming and Pathways

PAUSD high school students are highly capable of completing authentic research projects, succeeding in
advanced classes that are beyond the scope of our current offerings, and pursuing interests in topics and
classes that integrate various disciplines. Middle school and elementary school students have shown
exceptional interest in and capacity for engineering and design in both “Maker’s Studio” pilots and Industrial
Technology hands-on classes. In addition, while we have opportunities for students to take engineering,
robotics and computer science classes from middle school through high school do not have a coherent
curriculum or pathway classes in these areas. Examples of opportunities for improvement in this area
include:

•	Staff for further Class size reduction of current electives (currently there are more than when
class size exceeds 30 students in several of our advanced elective classes)

•	Support for differentiated instruction in K-6 mathematics instruction in grades K-6 to assure
all students are challenged appropriately

•	Advanced authentic research/procfucf/on program in science and arts for grades 10-12. \Ne
intend to provide qualified students with the opportunity to pursue a year-long research
project in an area where they have a fierce passion to explore, be it in the hard sciences, the
humanities, or the arts. Students will learn advanced research methods and be paired with
off-campus mentors who can guide and support their work. Throughout the year, students
will be required to complete and present a formal proposal, maintain detailed weekly logs,
provide interim progress reports, complete a formal poster, deliver a presentation to a
professional audience, and prepare a publication quality paper.

•	Advanced Computer science curriculum from grades 7-12 programming and computer
science classes

•	Additional electives for middle and high school students, beyond what is currently funded
by the current parcel tax and PiE donations, to challenge top students, e.g. Calculus Based
Physics, Organic Chemistry, Computational Chemistry and Physics, Multi-variable Calculus,
Discrete Mathematics, Graph Theory

•	Expanding investment in innovative STEM programs, industrial Technology, and integrated
classes

•	Engineering curriculum and instruction for grades 6-12

3.	Student Wellness

Of prominent importance is our extensive strategic commitment to assuring we have safe and welcoming
schools for all students. The schools need to provide staffing and facilities for the complete spectrum of
student health and wellness. Current needs include:

•	Physical wellness supports for exercise programming, nutrition counseling, and preventing
sleep disorders and sleep deprivation

•	Family and student counseling, workshops, classes, etc. beyond what the existing parcel tax
and PiE already provide programs and services

•	Nursing services for elementary school students and expanded nursing services for upper
grades

•	Stress management workshops, classes, and seminars for students

•	Annual bias and harassment training for students and staff

•	Extended innovative independent study courses tailored to students’ needs

The proposed parcel tax renewal is for an additional $120 per parcel with a continued senior exemption and
2% annual escalation adjustment. The proposed 2015 tax will start at $758 per parcel and is expected to
initially generate $14.7 million in revenue. The plan is to use the current $12.4 million in existing parcel tax
revenue and the estimated $2.3 million in new parcel tax revenue, if approved, to fund programs currently
supported by the current parcel tax as well as selected programs and services in the three areas described
above.

PROPOSAL

Staff has worked with Charles Heath, consultant, and Jeff Kuhn, attorney with Lozano Smith, to prepare a
resolution and ballot language for a new parcel tax. The resolution and ballot language increase the current
parcel tax rate by $120 to $758 per year, per parcel, for six years; and continues: an optional senior
exemption, the 2% annual escalation adjustments, and an independent oversight committee with annual
audits. The terms of the proposed measure are consistent with past parcel tax proposal in the District. The
ballot language states:

“To preserve support excellence in core academic programs,
including advanced science, math, reading and writing with locally
controlled funds that cannot be taken by the state; attract and
retain qualified teachers; protect student electives, including arts
and music, and advance health, well-being and equitable
opportunities for all students support at-risk students
struggling with the basics, shall Palo Alto Unified School
District renew its expiring parcel tax for six years, increase the
rate by $120, and continue exemptions for seniors, annual two
percent escalation adjustments, and independent oversight?”

The resolution and exhibits to the resolution are shown as Attachment B.

FISCAL IMPACT

It is proposed that a special mail-in election be called for May 5,2015. The cost of this election is
estimated by the Santa Clara County Registrar of Voters to be $306,000.

Proportions Much More Likely
to Oppose Parcel Tax Measure

They say this tax will only cost SI 20 more per year, but when
added to the existing tax. it will cost nearly $800 per year and d
keep increasing by two percent every year

The school district has too many highly paid administrators E

I don't like paying a parcel tax for a district that is wasting
money on the wrong priorities for how it spends the money it p

already has

Taxes are already too high; If the school district learned to live
within its means, we would not need to pay more taxes

Over the past few years, we all have had to cut back.
Instead of raising taxes, the school district should cut spending

The district has given out generous pay increases to teachers

FULL TEXT OF SPECIAL PARCEL TAX MEASURE

For

PALO ALTO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT

Palo Alto Unified School District
Quality Public Education Preservation Act of 2015

INTRODUCTION

To preserve support excellence in core academic programs, including advanced
science, math, reading, and writing with locally controlled funds that cannot be taken by
the state; attract and retain qualified teachers; protect student electives, including arts
and music, and advance health, well-being, and equitable opportunity for all
students and support at-risk students struggling with the basics, shall Palo Alto
Unified School District renew its expiring parcel tax for six years, increase the rate by
$120, and continue exemptions for seniors, annual two percent escalation adjustments,
and independent oversight?” Said qualified special parcel tax would renew, extend, and
replace the qualified special parcel tax approved by the voters of the District on May 4,
2010, as Measure A.

PURPOSE

To provide local revenue that cannot be taken by the State and to maintain exceptional
public education in our schools, the Palo Alto Unified School District proposes to renew,
extend, and replace its expiring qualified special parcel tax for a period of 6 years,
beginning July 1, 2015, at the rate of $758 per year on each assessor’s parcel located

nearest dollar) beginning with the 2016-17 fiscal year to account for increasing student
enrollment and the rising cost of providing programs, and to implement accountability
measures in connection with the special parcel tax to provide oversight and

mentors from universities, laboratories, medical facilities, cutting edge
businesses, and others that are available in Silicon Valley;
