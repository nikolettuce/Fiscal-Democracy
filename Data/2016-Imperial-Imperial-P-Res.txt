THE CITY’S TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY (ROOM) TAX CODE, BY

EFFECTIVE APRIL 1, 2017 AND ADDRESSING ONLINE TRAVEL

THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY OF EL CENTRO, CALIFORNIA DO HEREBY
ORDAIN AS FOLLOWS:

SECTION 1. Section 25-58 of Article IV of Chapter 25 of the El Centro Municipal Code
is hereby amended to read as follows:

Sec. 25-58. Definitions.

Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this section govern
the construction of this article:

Block Reservation ” means an arrangement whereby a person reserves, whether on an
exclusive or non-exclusive basis, a room or block/group of rooms for a defined period of
time under a written or oral agreement with an operator, intending for such room(s) to be
occupied by that person’s employees or agents on an intermittent, periodic or “as needed”
basis during that defined period of time.

Hotel means any structure or any portion of any structure which is occupied or intended
or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes and
includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging
house, rooming house, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobile home
or house trailer at a fixed location or other similar structure or portion thereof.

Occupancy means the use or possession or the right to the use or possession of any room
or rooms or portion thereof (whether or not the person entitled to the use or possession
actually uses or possesses such room or rooms or portion thereof) in any hotel for
dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. The use or possession or right to use or possess
any room or any suite of connecting rooms as office space, banquet or private dining
rooms, or exhibits, sample or display space shall not be considered “occupancy” within
the meaning of this definition unless the person exercising occupancy uses or possesses,
or has the right to use or possess all or any portion of such room or suite of rooms for
dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes.

Online Travel Company shall mean any person, whether operating for profit or not for
profit, which enables transients to purchase occupancy in a hotel via the Internet, or by
similar electronic means.

1

Operator means the person who is proprietor of the hotel (or any other person who has
the right to rent rooms within the hotel), whether in the capacity of owner, lessee,
sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, seller, reseller or any other capacity. Where
the operator performs his functions through a managing agent or booking agent of any
type or character other than an employee (including, but not limited to, an online travel
company), the managing agent or booking agent shall also be deemed an operator for the
purposes of this article and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal.
Compliance in full with the provisions of this article by either the principal or the
managing agent or booking agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by
both.

Person means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club,
fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust,
receiver, trustee, syndicate or any other group or combination acting as a unit.

Rent means the consideration charged to the transient, (including but not limited to, room
rates, service charges, parking fees, purchase price, advance registration, block or group
reservation charges, assessments, retail markup, commission, processing fees,
cancellation charges, attrition fees, or online booking fees), whether or not received, for
the occupancy in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor
or otherwise, including all receipts, cash credits and property and services of any kind or
nature without any deduction therefrom whatsoever. Bona fide charges for food and
beverages that are subject to tax under the California Sales and Use Tax Law (Revenue
and Taxation Code Section 6001 et seq) shall not be deemed rent subject to the tax
imposed by the Article. Nothing in this definition shall be construed to mean that rent is
charged directly or indirectly for occupancy in a hotel when a room is provided to the
transient as a compliment for the operator and where no consideration is charged to or
received from any other person.

Transient means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by
reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement for a period of
thirty (30) consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full
days. The following rules shall apply to this definition:

(a)	Any such person so occupying or entitled to occupy in a hotel shall be deemed
to be a transient until the period of thirty (30) calendar days has expired. In
determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time
extending both prior and subsequently to the effective date of this article may
be considered. In the event a person exercises or is entitled to occupancy for a
continuous and uninterrupted period of longer than 30 calendar days, he or she
shall be deemed a transient and subject to the tax for only the first 30 calendar
days of occupancy and shall cease being a transient and the tax shall not apply
on the 31st calendar day of occupancy and following. However, any break or
interruption in occupancy shall start a new 30 day period subject to the tax.

(b)	In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time
extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of this Article may
be considered.

2

(c)	Any person who exercises or is entitled to occupancy for a period of 30
consecutive calendar days or less shall be deemed to be a transient for that
period, regardless of whether the reservation and/or payment for occupancy is
made directly by the person exercising or entitled to occupancy or by another
person. The intent is to tax the person exercising occupancy or having the
entitlement to occupancy of a hotel room.

(d)	In the case of a block reservation, a person’s employee or agent shall be
deemed a transient if that employee or agent exercises or is entitled to
occupancy of a room for a period of 30 consecutive calendar days or less,
regardless of the duration of any block reservation agreement. By way of
example and not of limitation, if a corporation enters into a one-year block
reservation agreement with an operator and one of the corporation’s
employees occupies a room for 30 calendar days, the employee shall be
deemed a transient whose occupancy is subject to the tax, notwithstanding the
fact that the block reservation agreement has a duration longer than 30
calendar days.

SECTION 2. Section 25-59 of Article IV of Chapter 25 of the El Centro Municipal Code
is hereby amended to read as follows:

For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, effective as of April 1, 2017, and thereafter
until revised by the voters, each transient shall pay a tax of 13 percent of the rent charged
by the operator. Such tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city. The
transient shall pay the tax to the hotel operator when the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in
installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. Any tax
remaining unpaid when the transient no longer occupies space in the hotel is immediately
due and payable to the operator, and if not so paid may be collected by the city finance
officer or his/her designee.

(a)	No tax shall be imposed upon any person who is legally exempt from paying
the tax, any federal officer or State of California employee when occupying a room while
on official business, any officer or employee of a foreign government who is exempt by
reason of express provision of federal law or international treaty or any person who has
signed an agreement in writing for occupancy in a hotel for more than thirty (30) days or
who has actually occupied the hotel for more than thirty (30) days. For purposes of this
section, students, non-employee supporters and volunteers of California public
universities and colleges shall not be deemed to be officers or employees of the State of
California.

(b)	No exemption shall be granted except upon a claim therefor made at the time
rent is collected and under penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by the finance
director or his/her designee. Any federal or State of California officer or employee when
on official government business claiming such an exemption shall provide to the operator
as conclusive evidence that his or her occupancy is for the official business of his or her
employer:

issued by his or her employer to pay for the occupancy; and

(2)	Proof of his or her governmental employment as an employee or officer as
described in paragraph (1) of this subsection (b), and proof, consistent with these
provisions, that his or her occupancy is for the official business of his or her
governmental employer.

(c)	It shall be the duty of an operator to keep and maintain for a period of three to
keep and maintain for a period of three (3) years written documentation in support of
each exemption granted under this Section.

XIIIC §(2)(b) and California Elections Code §9217, if a majority of the qualified voters

such measure, this ordinance shall be deemed valid and binding and shall be considered
as adopted upon the date that the vote is declared by the City Council, and shall go into
effect ten (10) days after that date.

SECTION 4. Severability. If any section, sentence, clause or phrase of this ordinance is
for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional by a decision of any court of
competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining
provisions of this ordinance. The People of the City of El Centro hereby declare that they
would have adopted this ordinance and each section, sentence, clause or phrase thereof,
irrespective of die fact that any one or more section, subsections, sentences, clauses or
phrases be declared invalid or unconstitutional.
