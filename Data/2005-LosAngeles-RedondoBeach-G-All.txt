ment, and a host of other essential services to the com-
munity; and

WHEREAS, the People of the City of Redondo Beach
wish to amend the Municipal Code in order to increase
the maximum rate charged for the TOT from ten (10%)
percent to up to twelve (12%) percent, effective July 1,
2005, if approved by voters at the March 8, 2005 munici-
pal election; and

WHEREAS, the new rate would place the City of Redon-
do Beach in the same range as surrounding cities.

require that such tax shall be paid directly to the Tax
Collector.”

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF PROPOSITION G

A BALLOT MEASURE TO INCREASE THE
TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX

The City of Redondo Beach’s ordinance currently
authorizes the City to impose a transient occupancy tax
on hotel guests, which is collected and remitted to the
City by hotel operators, in the amount of ten percent
(10%) of the rent charged by the hotel operator to the
hotel guest.

Proposition G, if adopted, would amend the City’s
ordinance to authorize the City to increase the transient
occupancy tax to not more than twelve percent (12%) of
the rent charged by hotel operators to hotel guests.

/s/ Jerry Goddard City Attorney

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION G

Redondo Beach enjoys a reputation of maintaining quality
infrastructure and services. Doing so is challenging
during times of reduced revenues.

Like all cities in California, Redondo Beach’s budget has
suffered as the State has taken our revenues to balance
the State budget. These State take-aways have caused
the City to reduce staffing levels and cut other costs. In
an effort to not reduce services to the citizens of Redondo
Beach our fee and tax structure has been reviewed to
make sure it covers the cost of the service provided and
is competitive with our neighboring cities.

One tax reviewed is the Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT)
collected by hotels from hotel guests. The current
maximum TOT is 10%, which is well below average for
our region.

It has been over a decade since the TOT has been
changed.

The proposed maximum of 12% TOT has been discussed
with the City’s hotel industry and with the Redondo
Beach Chamber of Commerce and Visitors Bureau. They
support an increase up to 12%, which is still at the low
end for the region. The chairs of these organizations
have signed below.

The travel industry recognizes that the high level of
services provided to our citizens and visitors makes
Redondo Beach an attractive destination for tourists. The
local tourism industry is important to the Redondo Beach
economy and to the City’s General Fund.

The increased revenues from the TOT, paid by hotel
guests, will go into the General Fund to pay for City
services such as streets, parks and public safety.

Since the TOT is paid by visitors, we can make these
improvements without cost to our citizens.

Help keep Redondo Beach a beautiful and safe place to
live, work and visit.

Vote Yes on Proposition G.

Redondo Beach Councilman, District 5

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF
PROPOSITION G

Supporters of higher taxes claim that revenue is needed
because of state take-aways. However, this argument
is not true. In the November general election, voters
approved Proposition 1A for the protection of local
government revenues.

Advocates of higher taxes also claim that revenue is
needed to maintain services and infrastructure. This
argument is misleading. Redondo Beach has revenue.

For FY03-04, the Financial Services staff projects a
General Fund increase of $2 million or 4.3%. The Annual
Report states that “assets of the city exceeded its
liabilities by $146.5 million, and assets for business type
activities exceeded liabilities by $56 million.”

The proponents of raising taxes also argue that the city
should increase taxes because other cities have higher
taxes. However, the city’s Comprehensive Annual
Financial Report released in December 2004 states
that “Redondo Beach is better off than most cities,
experiencing growth in major revenue categories.”

Despite our increasing revenues and abundant assets,
Redondo Beach has cut school programs and reduced
staffing levels. At the same time, the city has increased
subsidies to business organizations such as the Redondo
Beach Chamber by 3.7%.

The Visitors Bureau receives an additional $227,900 or
1% of the TOT.

It’s not surprising that the Chamber and Visitors Bureau
support higher taxes as their programs take an ever
increasing share of our limited resources.

These special interest groups subsidized by our city
should keep out of local politics.

The case for higher taxes has not been made. Demand
accountability and better management.

Vote No on Proposition G.

/s/ Tory Erickson, Resident

Redondo Beach / 21

ARGUMENT AGAINST PROPOSITION G

Vote no on Proposition G, because this tax increase will
not help Redondo Beach, and it could hurt.

In a highly competitive market, even a small tax can
make the difference between winning customers and
losing business. If we increase taxes on visitors, and
lose the competition for those guests, we will also lose
other revenue. Restaurants, dry cleaners, and retailers
will lose business.

Measure G is also part of a wider demand for higher taxes
by local government. Redondo Beach recently imposed
a sewage tax without the voters’ approval and a business
tax increase is being pushed on this ballot.

These tax increases make Redondo Beach more
expensive and they are not needed.

Tax revenues have reached record levels. Property
taxes, parking tickets, and user fees have all significantly
increased while spending has spiraled out of control.
From 2001-2004, Redondo Beach budget revenues
increased by more than 36 million dollars, from over
71 million to over 107 million dollars. (See http://www.
redondo.org/services/city_docs/budget.asp)

It is disgraceful that we have not fully funded our after
school programs and have cut school crossing guards at
a time when Redondo Beach is taking in record levels of
tax revenue.

Even more shocking was the recent disclosure that
Redondo Beach forgot to collect 23 million dollars in
taxes from the AES power plant. This oversight, due to
lack of communication and confusing past agreements,
will most likely lead to costly litigation. (See “Redondo
Beach to bill power plant.” Daily Breeze 12/16/04)

Redondo Beach has repeatedly, engaged in, or needlessly
invited costly litigation. The exact costs of these actions
are not disclosed; but they are reflected in more than 4
million dollars of general liability expenses. We need to
re-focus our priorities.

Send a message to City Hall asking for more open
government and better management.

Vote No on Measure G.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST
PROPOSITION G

Vote in Favor of Proposition G.

Little if any of the “information” in the Argument Against
Proposition G is true or even related to the actual
proposition.

A complete competitive analysis of the hotel business
in Redondo Beach has been performed by the City in
conjunction with General Managers of many of our largest
hotels. The current authorized Transient Occupancy Tax
(TOT) is well below the average for the local cities where
our hotels compete. The authorized increase contained in
Proposition G would still have the TOT at the low end for
our region. The Redondo Beach Chamber of Commerce
and Visitors Bureau has signed the Argument in Favor of
Proposition G indicating the support of the local tourism
industry and business community.

The TOT is paid by hotel guests and collected by our
local hotels. The travel and tourism industry recognize
that the high level of services provided to our citizens and
visitors makes Redondo Beach an attractive destination
for tourists.

During the last 2 budget cycles the State has taken away
City revenues to balance the State budget. Nearly 60%
of our Annual General Fund Budget is spent on Public
Safety. Our City budget has prioritized Public Safety and
other critical City services.

The increased revenues from the TOT, paid by hotel
guest, will go into the General Fund to pay for critical City
services such as public safety, parks, streets and storm
drains.

Vote Yes on Proposition G.
