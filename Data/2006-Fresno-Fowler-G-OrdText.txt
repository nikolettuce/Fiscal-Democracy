FULL TEXT OF UTILITY USERS TAX EXTENSION ORDINANCE
SUBJECT TO RATIFICATION OF A MAJORITY OF THE
QUALIFIED VOTERS AT THE NOVEMBER 7, 2006 ELECTION

ORDINANCE NO. 2006-04

AN ORDINANCE OF THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF FOWLER
DELETING SECTION 3-7.20, OF CHAPTER 7, OF TITLE 3, OF THE
FOWLER MUNICIPAL CODE PERTAINING TO THE
SUNSETTING (TERMINATION) OF THE UTILITY USERS TAX

THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF FOWLER DOES ORDAIN AS FOLLOWS:

Section 1. The City Council finds and determines as follows:

(A)	In 1999 the City was confronted with a fiscal crisis that threatened the continued
operation and viability of the City as a governmental organization. At that time the voters of the City of
Fowler approved a utility users tax. The revenue from the utility users tax allowed the City to eliminate
its deficit and achieve a balanced budget. The tax originally contained a sunset provision that would have
resulted in the utility users tax terminating on January 1, 2003. In 2003, the voters of the City of Fowler
approved an extension of the utility users tax for an additional four years until January 1.2007.

(B)	The revenue from extending the tax helped ensure that the City was able to provide basic
and essential governmental services, including, but not limited to, police protection, fire protection, code
enforcement to abate public nuisances, senior and recreation services, and public works programs to
maintain, repair and replace streets, sidewalks, parks, and other public facilities.

(C)	There continues to be a minimal level of personnel, facilities, and equipment in every
department of the City.

(D)	A substantial portion of City revenues flows through the State government. The State
recently faced an unprecedented fiscal crisis and a budget deficit that substantially impacted City
revenues. It is likely that the State will face a similar fiscal crisis in the future.

(E)	Increasing costs will seriously impair the ability of the City to deliver basic and essential
governmental services as will an additional State fiscal crisis.

(F)	In response to the desire of the citizens of Fowler to remain a small city with slow
managed growth, the City adopted and implements a growth management ordinance. Much of the Cities
revenue, including grants, is tied to population. Therefore, the citizens desire for managed growth places
limitations on the City’ ability to increase its revenues than otherwise might exist.

Section 2.	Section 3-7.20, of Chapter 7, of Title 3, of the Fowler Municipal Code is hereby deleted.

Section 3.	This Ordinance shall be subject to ratification by the voters at the November 7, 2006,

election and the Council hereby calls for an election of this Ordinance as set forth in a separate resolution,
said election to be consolidated with the next regularly scheduled local election on November 7, 2006. If

a majority of the voters approves of this Ordinance at the election, this Ordinance shall become effective
November 8, 2006, and the Utility Users Tax shall continue without an automatic sunset (termination)
date.

The fbreg^jng orpipance is hereby approved this 18th day of July, 2006.
