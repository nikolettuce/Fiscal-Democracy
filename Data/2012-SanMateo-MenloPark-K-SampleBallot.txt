Measure K

To partially restore the annual revenue loss of $ 1.2 million caused by the State’s dissolution of the City’s redevelopment agency, to maintain
current City service levels for police, library, streets, sidewalks, storm drains, and parks and recreation facilities and programs, and to keep
parity with neighboring cities’ hotel tax rates, shall the City of Menlo Park adopt an ordinance to increase the transient occupancy tax on
hotel guests from 10% to 12% effective January 1, 2013?_______________________________________________________________

Impartial Analysis of Measure K

State law allows the City of Menlo Park to impose a transient
occupancy tax on short term occupants of hotels, motels, inns or
other lodging. The transient occupancy tax (sometimes referred to
as a “hotel tax”) is a tax on the nightly room rent paid by visitors
staying in hotels, motels, inns or other lodging in the City of Menlo
Park for stays of thirty consecutive days or less.

The City, through Chapter 3.16 of the Municipal Code, has levied
a transient occupancy tax on hotel and motel visitors since 1967.
This measure would increase the transient occupancy tax rate from
10% to 12%. By way of example, if this measure is approved, for
a room that costs $100 per night, the tax due would increase from
$10.00 to $12.00 per night. The tax rate was last increased in 1992.
Copies of Ordinance 938 and Chapter 3.16 are available at the City
Clerk’s office and on the City Clerk’s page on the City’s website at
www.menlopark.org.

The proceeds of the transient occupancy tax increase will be placed
in the City’s general fund to support general City services, such
as police and maintenance of streets, sidewalks, parks and storm
drains. Any general tax increase, such as the proposed increase in
the transient occupancy tax, requires approval of a two thirds vote
of the City Council and majority approval of the voters at a general
election at which council members are up for election. Ordinance
938 to increase the transient occupancy tax was unanimously
approved by the City Council subject to voter approval. If approved
by voters on November 6th, the increase would become effective
on January 1, 2013.

A “Yes” vote is a vote to approve and authorize an increase in the
transient occupancy tax rate from 10% to 12% to support general
City services and functions. A “No” vote on this measure would not
allow an increase in the tax rate for hotel and motel guests, leaving
the tax rate at 10%.

The measure passes if a majority of those voting on the measure
vote “Yes.”

The City of Menlo Park has been challenged to maintain the City
services our residents enjoy and expect. We have weathered the
recession with limited impact to residents and services, the State
of California’s decision to eliminate redevelopment agencies
significantly reduced the amount of funding available to support
City services, including programs to improve the quality of life in
Belle Haven. To provide the current level of services requires the
City to make up the annual loss in excess of $1.2 million. While
the City has implemented many cost saving measures and continues
to pursue additional cost saving measures, without an increase in
revenues the City may have to reduce services. Raising the Hotel
Tax would support services and the quality of life residents expect
in Menlo Park.

The Hotel Tax is a significant revenue source for Menlo Park. A 2%
increase, from 10% to 12%, could produce approximately $600,000
annually.

This is a minor expense to hotel visitors and will set the rate for
Menlo Park hotels at the same level as Palo Alto, East Palo Alto and
Redwood City, our neighboring cities.

Increased revenues would assist the City in maintaining current
service levels for public safety, street and sidewalk maintenance,
recreation facilities, parks and other services that benefit residents
and businesses. The City currently allocates more than half
its operating budget toward public safety and street and park
maintenance. Residents choose to live in Menlo Park because of
these high quality services.

Difficult decisions have been made and will continue to be made
to move Menlo Park toward a sustainable budget, including
eliminating staff and reducing personnel expenses, such as pensions
and health benefits. Further cuts may cause a reduction in services.
Menlo Park City Council voted unanimously to place this measure
on the ballot.

We appreciate your yes vote for the benefit of the entire Menlo Park
community.

Every time a tax measure is put on the ballot, we - the taxpayers -
are promised that the money will go to pay for or preserve critical
services. But, when the politicians get the money, they wind up
spending it as they please. Measure K is no different.

Measure K does not require the City to spend the higher tax
revenues on sidewalk maintenance, recreation facilities, parks, or
public safety. So the City will be free to spend the money just as
unwisely as they have in the past.

Don’t be scared. Those pushing for tax hikes always threaten to
cut the same vital services if they don’t get their way. That’s not
what happens when we say NO to higher taxes. Non-essential
services, non-essential government employees, and high salaries
and benefits are cut first. And in Menlo Park, there’s plenty to cut.

Don’t be fooled. The way to generate more revenue for the city
is to cut, not raise, taxes. Tax cuts stimulate the economy, which
results in more business, which in turn generates more revenue for
the City. Instead of increasing the Transit Occupancy Tax to 12%,
they should reduce it. That will give Menlo Park hotels a greater
competitive advantage over nearby cities.

Don’t be scared and don’t be fooled into voting for higher taxes.
Vote NO on Measure K.

Argument Against Measure K

The Transient Occupancy Tax is an unfair burden on the few
establishments to which it applies and their many customers.

Menlo Park currently imposes a 10% Transient Occupancy Tax on
guests in the hotels, motels and inns of Menlo Park. There are only
a few such establishments in Menlo Park.

The idea that only visitors pay this tax is incorrect. A visitor isn’t
automatically willing to pay more for a room when there is a
higher tax.

The law of supply and demand always applies. That means higher
prices translate into fewer customers. Fewer customers mean
slower revenue for not only the hotels in Menlo Park, but for every
other business that caters to travelers.

Hotel owners can either absorb the tax via lower room rates or risk
losing business and having to lay off workers.

To keep occupancy as high as possible, hotel owners have to keep
their prices competitive. Otherwise, visitors will decide not to
travel, go to other hotels in neighboring cities, or stay with friend
and relatives.

Increasing hotel taxes discourages travel and penalizes businesses
that cater to travelers, i.e. restaurants, bars, tourist attractions, etc.

If you vote “No” on Measure K, the 10% tax will remain at the 10%
rate, and thus give Menlo Park hotels a competitive advantage over
hotels in neighboring cities.

And, it will impose some fiscal responsibility on the city council
by denying them additional revenues to spend on their pet projects.

A No vote means more travelers spending more money in Menlo
Park.

Now is the time to cut unfair taxes, not raise them.

Vote “No” on Measure K.

Rebuttal to Argument Against Measure K

The Menlo Park City Council voted unanimously to place this
measure on the ballot in order to allow the City to maintain
current services for residents and businesses. Even though
difficult decisions have been made to stabilize the City budget, the
State’s dissolution of redevelopment agencies has threatened the
City’s ability to deliver vital services such as street and sidewalk
maintenance, police services and facility operations.

To suggest that the Council wishes to use this increase to fund “pet
projects” has no basis in fact.

The assertion that the Hotel Tax places an “unfair” burden on a
few establishments is not valid. All hotels are required to charge
the established tax rate in the communities in which they choose
to locate.

The argument in opposition also refers to the damage that
increased hotel taxes might cause. Hotels in the area are doing
well. Occupancy rates are close to 80% for Menlo Park and Palo
Alto. Palo Alto already charges a 12% hotel tax. The proposed
2% increase would allow Menlo Park rates to match those charged
in neighboring cities. Menlo Park hotels have a “competitive
advantage” provided by the quality of public services. Studies
show travelers do not consider hotel taxes when choosing hotels
or destinations.

The best way to support local hotels and business, is to retain the
quality services that make Menlo Park a great place to visit and do
business.

Vote yes on Measure K to maintain quality services in Menlo Park.
