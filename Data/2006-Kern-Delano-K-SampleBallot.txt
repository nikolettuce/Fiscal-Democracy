IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY CITY OF DELANO MEASURE K	FISCAL IMPACT STATEMENT CITY OF DELANO MEASUREK
TEMPORARY (TEN-YEAR) ONE-HALF PERCENT SALES TAX INCREASE  This ballot measure, if adopted by the voters, would enact a temporary ten-year one-half percent (.5%) increase to the sales tax rate in the City of Delano. The sales tax is also referred to as a “transactions and use tax.” The current sales tax rate in the City of Delano is seven and one-quarter percent (7.25%). Accordingly, if this ballot measure is adopted, the sales tax rate would increase to seven-and-three-quarter percent (7.75%) forthe next ten years. The proposed in- creased sales tax, like the current sales tax, would be imposed upon the sale of all tangible personal property sold at retail within the jurisdictional limits of the City as well as upon the storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property purchased from any retailer in the jurisdictional limits of the City.  All revenue generated from the proposed sales tax increase would be used by the City to pay for police services and fire services. Seventy percent (70%) of the tem- porary sales tax revenue would be utilized for police services and thirty percent (30%) of the temporary sales tax revenue would be utilized for fire services. As such, this ballot measure proposes a “special purpose tax” rather than a “general purpose tax” and requires a 2/3 majority vote for adoption.  This wording applies to Measure K:  This is an impartial analysis of Measure K. If you want a copy of the City’s resolu- tion ordering the election to vote on Measure K, please call Kern County Elections at (661) 868-3590or 1 -800-452-8683 and a copy will be mailed at no cost to you.	TEMPORARY (TEN-YEAR) ONE-HALF PERCENT SALES TAX INCREASE^/!  The total sales tax rate in the City of Delano is currently 7.25% or Seven & a quar- ter cent for every dollar. Of this amount the City receives 1% or 1 cent for every dollar in sales. This is deposited in the general fund which is used to pay for gen- eral City services such as Police, fire, park maintenance, recreational facilities, street repair engineering and administration.  This measure if approved by voters will increase the total tax rate to 7.75% and would raise the local City portion to 1.5%. The current sales tax generated $3,576,120 for the annual period from July 2005 to June 2006, including amounts withheld by the State. Based on that amount, the proposed half cent increase would generate an additional $1,788,060 to be earmarked exclusively for police and fire services. This is an approximation of the amount that can be expected an- nually during the ten year period the tax would be in effect. Actual collections can vary from year to year depending upon economic conditions.  Note: The breakdown of the 7.25% total sales tax is as follows:  6% - State 1% - City of Delano  1/4% - County wide Transportation Fund  Currently, the State has reduced the City portion by 1 /4%, thereby getting 6-1/4% instead of 6%. A Compromise Agreement between the State and Local Govern- ments guarantees payment of this 1/4% City portion of the sales tax temporarily taken by the State by means of a property tax backfill.
