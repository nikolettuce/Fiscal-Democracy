Re:	June	9,2015- Public Records Act Request

Dear Ms. Lopez:

This letter is a follow-up on your June 9,2015 request for public records emailed to the Calexico
City Clerk. After researching the documents from the off-site storage, attached please find the
records responsive to Measure Q. Please note that we were not able to find any records
pertaining to Measure Z. This is the last of the records responsive to your request.

Thank you for your attention in this matter. If you have any further questions, please do not
hesitate to contact me if I may be of further assistance to you.

Sincerely,

CITY COUNCIL
AGENDA REPORT



SUBJECT: REQUEST BY THE HEFFERNAN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL
DISTRICT TO HAVE THE COUNCIL CONSIDER AND CALL A SPECIAL
ELECTION TO RETAIN THE HALF CENT SALES TAX.

AGENDA DATE: August 2,2005

PREPARED BY: Jennifer M. Lyon, City Attorney

APPROVED FOR AGENDA BY: Marlene D. Best, City Manager^/AS>

RECOMMENDATION: Give direction to staff.

FISCAL IMPACT: None. Heffeman has agreed to pay the costs of the special election.
(See attached letter dated 7/27/05 by E. Rivera).

BACKGROUND INFORMATION: (Prior action/information) The Heffeman
Memorial Hospital District submitted a request to the Mayor dated May 27, 2005 to have
the Council discuss and approve a call for a special election to submit an initiative to the
voters of Calexico to consider the retention of the half cent sales tax.

DISCUSSION (Current consideration): This item has been continued several times to
obtain more information from the Heffeman Board regarding a feasibility study and a
business plan. A feasibility study was submitted to the City, however, no business plan
has been received. Also, Attorney Rivera sent a letter to the City dated July 27, 2005
which states that a majority of the Heffeman Board is still in favor of submitting this
measure to the voters. Mr. Rivera also confirmed that the Board voted to pay the costs of
any special election. The deadline to submit ballot measures to the County is August 12.

Based on the information I had at the time of the June 21st meeting, I advised the Council
that the best way to handle this request would be to impose a new half cent sales tax.
Subsequent to that meeting, I have learned that the current half cent sales tax may not be
ending as soon as was previously thought. Based on the uncertainty of the termination
date and discussions with the State Board of Equalization, if the Council wants to
entertain this request, the Council should submit a proposition to the voters to adopt an
ordinance which amends the sunset clause of the current half cent sales tax. If the voters
decide to adopt the proposed ordinance which amends the sunset ordinance, then the
current half cent sales tax will be retained for a period to be determined by the Council.
There is a question as to whether the vote of the people requires a two thirds approval or
a simple majority approval. Since this is a measure for the benefit of Heffeman, Attorney
Rivera is researching this issue.



/?***\

If the Council wants to submit this item to the voters, the Council must agree by a
majority vote to approve the ordinance which amends the sunset ordinance prior to
submitting this proposal to the voters because if passed by the voters, this new ordinance
would extend a special tax. Also, if the Council is in favor of submitting this item to the
voters, the Council should approve the two attached resolutions calling the election and
requesting the County to conduct the special election.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION: (Prior action/information) In 1996, voters
approved a measure to sunset the half cent sales tax for the Hospital District upon
retirement of the bonds.

DISCUSSION (Current consideration): The Special Financing Authority has notified
the City that the bonds will be retired within the next 110 days, no later than March 1,

Equalization (“SBOE”) at least 110 days prior to repeal of the sales tax. The SBOE
processes the repeal of taxes at the end of calendar quarters. Therefore, the City is giving
notice by way of this resolution that the SBOE is supposed to cease levy and collection of
the sales tax as of April 1, 2006; therefore, the last day of collection of the tax will be on
March 31st, 2006.
