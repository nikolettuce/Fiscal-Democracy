In Its Capacity as the
TULARE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY
ORDINANCE NO. 2006-01

AN ORDINANCE PERTAINING TO THE LEVY OF A RETAIL TRANSACTION AND USE TAX FOR TRANSPORTATION
PURPOSES.

THE TULARE COUNTY ASSOCIATION OF GOVERNMENTS IN ITS CAPACITY AS THE TULARE COUNTY
TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY ORDAINS AS FOLLOWS:

Section 1. PURPOSE: The road, transportation and circulation systems within the incorporated and unincorporated territories of
Tulare County are of regional concern and the quality of such systems have a direct impact on residents, visitors, agriculture, business,
industry and general economy within the county.

Most of the roads and other infrastructure supporting transportation and circulation within the Tulare County regional were constructed
in the early to middle part of the last century, well before the adoption of Proposition 13, which proposition significantly limited the main
source of income to the County and Cities for infrastructure maintenance, improvement and expansion. The loss of income for this purpose has
not been adequately made up by other sources, including monies from the State and United States governments, so as to allow needed
maintenance, upgrading or safety improvements to the existing infrastructure or the construction of the new infrastructure that the County and
Cities anticipate will be needed to meet the demands of the future.

Section 2. SUMMARY: This Ordinance provides for the imposition of a retail transaction and use tax of one-half percent for local
transportation purposes for a period of thirty (30) years, the authority to issue limited tax bonds secured by such taxes, the administration of the
tax proceeds and a county transportation expenditure plan.

approved, two-thirds of the electors voting on this measure must vote in favor of the ordinance.

If this measure is approved, Ordinance No. 2006-01 of the Tulare County Transportation Authority (“TCTA”) will be implemented, imposing a
one-half (lA) cent retail transactions and use tax countywide within Tulare County. The tax will be effective for thirty (30) years and may fund
the construction, maintenance, improvement, and operation in Tulare County of streets, roads, and highways, and the construction, improvement,
and operation of public transit systems as provided in the 2006 ‘A Cent Transportation Sales Tax Measure Expenditure Plan (“Expenditure Plan”)
adopted by the TCTA. The Expenditure Plan may be reviewed and amended annually pursuant to section 180207 of the Public Utilities Code.
A citizens’ oversight committee shall be appointed to ensure that tax revenue is expended in accordance with the Expenditure Plan.

If this measure is approved, the ordinance will be operative but the one-half QA) cent retail transactions and use tax cannot be levied earlier than
one hundred ten (110) days after the date of the election.

If this measure is approved, the TCTA will also be given authority to issue bonds in the future if needed to finance capital outlay expenditures,
as may be provided for in the Expenditure Plan, payable from the proceeds of the retail transactions and use tax. Pursuant to Public Utilities
Code section 180250(b), the maximum bonded indebtedness that may be outstanding at any one time cannot exceed the estimated proceeds of
the tax, as determined by the Expenditure Plan.

The TCTA’s annual spending appropriations limit will be set by the measure at one hundred million dollars (USD $100,000,000). TCTA will
be subject to this limitation during any initial partial year and the first full year when the tax is imposed and collected. Thereafter, the TCTA’s
appropriations limit shall be determined as provided by section 1 of Article XIIIB of the California Constitution and other applicable laws.

This measure makes no change to existing laws but will add to existing laws a countywide ordinance imposing a one-half QA) cent retail
transactions and use tax within Tulare County. The electors entitled to vote on this measure are the registered voters within Tulare County. If
the measure is not approved by two-thirds of the votes cast on the measure, the measure will fail and the one-half QA) cent tax will not be

TRANSPORTATION SALES TAX
MEASURE EXPENDITURE PLAN

Measure R - Final 200614 Cent Transportation Sales Tax Measure Expenditure Plan

Introduction

A Tulare County 1/2 Cent Transportation Sales Tax Expenditure Plan was prepared to:

Guide more than $652 million in transportation fund expenditures
generated through the approval of a Tulare County’s half-cent
transportation sales tax over the next 30 years, if approved by voters in

the November 2006 election.

The Expenditure Plan, developed by the Tulare County Association of Governments (TCAG) and nine
member agencies (Dinuba, Exeter, Farmersville, Lindsay, Porterville, Tulare, Visalia, Woodlake and the County
of Tulare) representing diverse community interests, will address major regional transportation needs in Tulare
County through the Year 2037 with the initiation of a Vz cent sales tax. TCAG considered established regional
needs, projects identified by voters and input from all of the city/County member agencies. To ensure the Plan
addressed transportation needs of all County residents, the Tulare County Association of Governments:

•	Adhered to requirements contained in the Public Utilities Code 180000 et seq.;

•	Reviewed other transportation sales tax measure programs recently passed in other counties (best
practices review); and

•	Reviewed established transportation needs in Tulare County.

Overview - Expenditure Plan: Where the money will go

Figure 1 provides an overview
of the proposed Expenditure Plan that
outlines where the funds will be spent
and what categories of projects will be
funded. The funding categories
include Regional Projects, Local
Projects, Transit/Bicycle/Environmental
and Administration. The formulas and
breakdown of the expenditures were
approved by the Tulare County
Association of Governments. The
proposed 30-year Transportation
Measure is expected to generate a
total of $652 million. Half of this
amount is allocated for Regional
Projects. The Regional projects are
established from the adopted Regional
Transportation Plan (RTP) approved
by all member agencies in Tulare

County. The projects within the RTP were selected through a process that evaluated safety, performance
measures and cost effectiveness. The Regional Transportation Plan is updated every two years with 25 years
of transportation projects. Many of the projects provide benefits for multiple jurisdictions such as interchange
improvements, regional widening projects and environmental mitigation measures.

Referencing Figure 1, the allocations consider the many diversified transportation needs of Tulare
County and have the following components, as shown:

•	35%	of the expected Transportation Measure funds are allocated to “Local Programs”.

Due to the diverse needs of the cities and the County, the Local Programs category was
created. The Local Programs category allows each of the member agencies to develop
a priority list of projects based on community needs. This allows each jurisdiction,
flexibility to determine local needs. This category will allow funding for projects ranging
from “pot-hole repair”, road rehabilitation and freeway interchange improvements.

•	14%	of the funds are directed to Transit, Bike/Pedestrian and Environmental projects.

The program contains important projects to link the regional bike systems, provide
increased transit service and an investment in environmental mitigation.

•	The remaining 1% of the total expected Transportation Measure funding is directed to
program implementation activities.

Details regarding the implementation of each of the programs are provided in Appendix A and B.

Responding to Public Needs

Two-thirds (67%) voter approval is necessary to pass the Transportation Measure in November 2006.

In order to ensure that Tulare County Association of Governments is on target with this Expenditure Plan,
voters and community residents were initially surveyed to determine support for a new Transportation Measure.
The Voters of Tulare County responded with strong support to impose a sales tax which would lead to
transportation improvements in Tulare County.

Meeting the needs of Tulare County residents requires leveraging State and Federal expenditures with
local resources. Even with passage of the Measure there will not be enough funding available to address the
more than $1.5 billion in transportation needs. The Transportation Measure will generate slightly more than
$652 million over the next 30 years to address a portion of this need. Therefore leveraging additional federal
and state dollars, beyond what the region expects, is critical. Most State and Federal grants require a match.
Agencies that pass transportation sales tax measures are referred to as “Self-Help” and can generate the
revenues for a match. Similar measures throughout the Valley and California have been very successful in this
regard. Such measures have been viewed as the most important transportation programs ever approved by
voters in those counties. Tulare County needs to become a “Self-Help” County.

The cities, the County of Tulare, and TCAG worked together to develop the Expenditure plan categories of
funding, the list of regional projects, list of transit/bike/environmental projects and other key components. Regional
Projects were first based on the adopted Transportation Plan approved by all agencies. A list of other regional projects
was prepared that could be funded if additional revenues were received. All of the cities and County worked together to
develop the Regional Program distribution. In response to the public survey the cities and the County developed a list of
bike, transit, and environmental projects.

Measure R - Final 200614 Cent Transportation Sales Tax Measure Expenditure Plan

Annual Audit of Transportation Measure Programs

The Transportation Measure expenditures and accounts of the local agencies and the Authority will be
audited on an annual basis by an independent audit firm retained by Tulare County Association of
Governments. Appendix A provides additional detail regarding the Transportation Measure audit process.

Citizen Oversight

To inform the public and to ensure that the Transportation Measure revenues and expenditures are
spent as promised to the public, a Citizens’ Oversight Committee would be formed by TCAG as part of the new
Transportation Measure. Details regarding the Committee are provided in Appendix C.

Anticipated Measure Revenues

If voters approve the Transportation Measure on November 7, 2006, they will allow TCAG to impose a !4 cent retail
transaction and use tax for 30 years (between April 1,2007 and March 31,2037). The Transportation Measure Sales Tax
will:

Provide $652.8 million in new revenues for transportation improvements according to

financial projections through the year 2037.

This estimate considers current sales tax receipts (with no growth rate in sales tax proceeds) through March
2037. Since the project funding is shown in current dollars, the projected revenues are shown in current dollars. The
allocation of projected sales tax revenues to specific types of transportation funding programs and improvement projects
is described in the following sections of this Expenditure Plan. A Strategic/Work Plan detailing current transportation
projects will be updated every two (2) years to adjust the projection of sales tax receipts, ensuring that the projections are
consistent with future expenditures and promises made in this initial Expenditure Plan. TCAG will have the option of
issuing bonds to deliver Transportation Measure projects and programs contained in this Expenditure Plan to reduce
project costs by delivering them earlier.

Road Map for the Work Plan: What We Will Do

Through many weeks of intense discussion and hard work, the following Transportation Measure funding
program commitments were developed by the Tulare County Association of Governments and member agencies. TCAG
realized that providing funds for all modes of transportation would meet the quality of life intent of the new Transportation
Measure. This would in turn enable agencies within Tulare County to address the needs of residents, businesses, and
major industries over the 30-year life of the Transportation Measure. The Expenditure Plan will:___________

Provide funds for regional road improvements, public transit, rehabilitate existing roads and other transportation
programs that improve mobility and air quality within the County and each of the cities.

Expenditure Plan programs are detailed in Tables 1 through 4. Implementing Guidelines for each of the four (4)
Expenditure programs described on the next page are contained in Appendix B.

Measure R - Final 200614 Cent Transportation Sales Tax Measure Expenditure Plan


REGIONAL PROJECTS (Regional Transportation Program) - $326.4 million or 50%.

Authorizes major new projects to:

Improve freeway interchanges
Add additional lanes
Increase safety

Improve and reconstruct major commute corridors

These projects provide for the movement of goods, services, and people throughout Tulare County. Major highlights
of this Program include the funding of Regional projects through out the County. There are two phases. Phase 1
contains projects planned to be funded in the first 15 years and Phase 2 are projects expected to be funded in years
16 through 30. A map showing the regional Projects for Phase 1 may be found on Figure 2.

Funds can be used for all phases of project development and implementation. Projects in both Phase 1 and Phase 2
are expected to be completed within the life of the Transportation Measure. This funding program requires matching
funds from the State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) administered locally through TCAG. If funding is
received beyond revenue projections in the first 15 years, projects from the Phase 2 list would be advanced.

LOCAL TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM ■ $228.4 million or 35%.

The goal is to improve each individual city’s and the County’s local transportation systems.

$35%	or $7.6 million a year has been guaranteed for local determined projects. Each City and the County will

receive funding based on a formula using population, maintained miles, and vehicles miles traveled. The funding
will help cities and the County to meet scheduled maintenance needs and to rehabilitate their aging transportation
systems.

Potential uses include:

Pothole repair
Repave streets
Bridge repair or replacement
Traffic signals

Add additional lanes to existing streets and roads

Improve sidewalks

Separate street traffic from rail traffic

The local agencies in Tulare County know what their needs are and how best to address those needs.

Funds can be used for all phases of project development and implementation. The County of Tulare would use the
Local Transportation Program funds to create a “Farm to Market” program. Specific Local Transportation Program
highlights and implementing guidelines are described in Appendix B.

TRANSIT/BIKES/ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATION PROGRAM (Multi-Modal Transportation Program) - $91.3
million or 14%.

The goal of this program is to expand or enhance public transit programs that address the transit dependent
population, improve mobility through the construction of bike lanes and have a demonstrated ability to get people out
of their cars and improve air quality and environment. This funding program requires matching funds from the
Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) and Transportation Enhancement (TE) Programs administered locally
through TCAG. To accomplish this important goal:

Funding is provided to transit agencies within the County to expand transit services. Funding would be provided
for regional bike routes through out the County. Other uses include:

Measure R - Final 200614 Cent Transportation Sales Tax Measure Expenditure Plan

New routes to enhance existing transit service

Low emission buses

Night and weekend service

Bus shelters and other capital improvements

Safer access to public transit services

Regional bike routes

Environmental Mitigation

Preliminary Light Rail investment

Specific Transit Enhancement Program highlights and implementing guidelines are also described in Appendix B.

ADMINISTRATION AND PLANNING PROGRAM - $6.5 million or 1%.

Transportation Measure funding is provided to TCAG to:

Prepare Strategic/Work Plan updates
Develop funding allocation requirements

Administer and conduct specified activities identified in the other three (3) programs described above
Prepare Annual Transportation Measure Report and contract for an independent audit

Expenditure Plan Projects

This section identifies priority regional street and highway improvement projects to be implemented over the life of the
Measure or by the year 2037. The projects would be funded with Measure, State Transportation Improvement Program
(STIP), and/or other transportation funding.

Phase 1 capacity increasing street and road projects to be addressed in this Program are included in Table 1 and
graphically displayed in Figure 2. Phase 2 projects are included in Table 2. Phase 1 projects are projected for funding for
the first 15 years of the Measure and Phase 2 projects are projected to be funded in years 16 through 30. These projects
will be funded using:

•	Measure funding (approximately $324 million).

•	A portion of State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) funding expected over the 30-year
Measure or approximately $587 million, (conservatively estimated based on recent state funding
history)

•	Other sources including local contributions totaling $2.9 million

These funding sources together result in slightly more than $903 million available for Phase 1 and Phase 2 Regional
projects. Phase 2 projects are considered for advancement if additional funding is available and the projects are
amended in to the current Regional Transportation Plan. During preparation of the biennial Strategic/Work Plan Updates,
TCAG will develop a detailed improvement program that specifies the timing and delivery of projects or funding order
considering project cost benefit, project readiness, and funding availability. A description of funding commitments and
implementing guidelines for the Regional Program are provided in Appendix B.

Measure R - Final 200614 Cent Transportation Sales Tax Measure Expenditure Plan

Project Commitments - Other Programs

In addition to the Regional Program of projects, the Transportation Measure will provide additional funding for a wide
range of projects determined based on agency need. Table 3 shows the projected revenue distribution for the Local
Programs. Each Agency will have different types of transportation projects. Examples of projects would include “pot-
hole” repair, road rehabilitation, adding travel lanes, interchange improvements and other transportation related projects.

The County of Tulare will use the Local Program funding to create a “Farm to Market” program and for other road
improvements to existing, community, local unincorporated roads. Figure 3 is a map showing potential or candidate
projects for road rehabilitation. The projects are geographically distributed to all parts of the County. The map is shown
for illustrative purposes. The County of Tulare will also create a “Local Community Road Improvement Program.” The
Local Community Road Improvement Program would provide funding for transportation improvements in unincorporated
communities. A partial list of the communities is shown below:

-	Alpaugh

-	Cutler-Orosi

-	Ducor

-	Earlimart

-	East Orosi

-	East Porterville

-	Goshen

-	Ivanhoe

-	Lemon Cove

-	London

-	Pixley

-	Poplar/Cotton Center

-	Richgrove

-	Springville

-	Strathmore

-	Terra Bella

-	Tipton

-	Traver

-	Woodville

- Other smaller communities such as Allensworth, Oak Ranch, and Waukena

The other projects the County may potentially use the Local Program funding for include: “Pot-hole” repair, bridge repair,
installation of traffic signals and transportation safety projects. The County will evaluate annually the Local Program
funded projects and prioritize based on local needs.

The City of Visalia would use the Local Program funding provided through a transportation sales tax augmentation to
implement the City’s circulation element, and, at Council discretion, may use some of the funds to conduct on-going
street maintenance.

Exactly how the City would use the funds could depend on the implementation policies of the tax including but not limited
to the amount and rate of project funds generated by the tax, the criteria and priorities used to select the Tier II projects
to be funded by the project portion of the sales tax, the financing options allowable under the provisions of the sales tax
program, the reimbursement policies of the sales tax program, the availability of grants, bond funds, matching funds,
private sector participation, federal earmarks and other types of available funding, what the impact such new monies will
have on project prioritization, how cost overruns and revenue shortfalls will be addressed, how projects that impact state
highways and/or other jurisdictions will be addressed through the implementation plan, and other factors yet to be
determined.

Visalia’s share of the Local Program funds could yield $49.1 million in current dollars. The projects that would assist with
the implementation of the City of Visalia’s circulation element and therefore could be funded by the Local Program
portion of the tax could include, some, but not all of the following:

*Signal Light Synchronization ($9.6 million, est.)

Interchange improvements at Lovers Lane and State Highway 198 ($18.5 million, est.)

Interchange improvements at Shirk and State Highway 198 ($9 million, est.)

Interchange improvements at Akers and State Highway 198 ($1.5 million, est.)

Interchange improvements at Downtown Visalia (State Highway 63) and State Highway 198 ($20 million, est.)

*Street maintenance (Est. $500,000/annually over 30 years or $15 million)

Measure R - Final 200614 Cent Transportation Sales Tax Measure Expenditure Plan

Should additional monies become available, or if funding for the above projects comes from another source, some of the
following elements of the City of Visalia’s transportation system could be funded; however, there is not expected to be
enough money from the sales tax augmentation Local Program funds to pay for these critical needs:

*New interchange at Road 148 and State Highway 198 ($25 million, est.)

*Santa Fe Street from Caldwell Avenue to Riggin Avenue, including overcrossing ($12.6 million)

*Overcrossing improvements at Ben Maddox and State Highway 198 ($2.8 million, est.)

*Overcrossing improvements at McAuliff and State Highway 198 ($14 million est.)

*Shirk Street improvements & widening from Highway 198 to Riggin ($9 million)

*Caldwell widening from State Route 99 to Mooney Blvd and Santa Fe Street to Road 156 ($12.6 million)
*Goshen Avenue realignment to intersect at Lovers Lane and Mill Creek Parkway ($4 million)

(All estimates are in current dollars; estimated figures noted are the unfunded portions of the projects
after the 2007/08 fiscal year.)

The City of Farmersville candidate projects include: traffic signal and intersection improvements to the intersections of
Walnut & Freedom Drive and Farmersville & Noble Drive. Other potential uses for Local Program funding in Farmersville
include street reconstruction and overlay projects. The City will evaluate annually the Local Program funded projects and
prioritize based on local needs.

The City of Exeter candidate projects include: road widening with curb and gutter to Filbert Street, Glaze Street, and 3rd
Street. The City will evaluate annually the Local Program funded projects and prioritize based on local needs.

Other Tulare County cities would have candidate projects that could include “pot-hole" repair, road rehabilitation, adding
travel lanes, interchange improvements and other transportation related projects. The cities will evaluate annually the
Local Program funded projects and prioritize based on local needs.

Table 4 provides a list of multi-modal transportation projects. Many of these projects will be identified and implemented
by the local agencies to address specific needs or will be developed in accordance with implementing guidelines included
in Appendix B. Examples include: Mass Transit Improvements, regional Bike trails, and contributions to environmental
banking.

Measure R - Final 200614 Cent Transportation Sales Tax Measure Expenditure Plan

APPENDICES

Appendix A - Plan Administration

Governing Board and Organizational Structure

A description of the Tulare County Association of Governments and its organizational structure related to the
sales tax follows. The structure is consistent with the enabling legislation.

Tulare County Transportation Authority Structure under the Measure Program

The Tulare County Association of Governments (TCAG) will be the Tulare County Transportation Authority and
administer the Measure Program in compliance with Public Utilities Code PUC 180000 et seq. If the Measure is
approved by Tulare County voters in November 2006, the Authority will be responsible for administering the
Measure Programs in accordance with plans and programs outlined in this and subsequent updates of this Plan.

In addition, this Plan includes provision for a Citizens' Oversight Committee. Details regarding the Committee are
contained in Appendix C. The Strategic/Work Plan will continue to be prepared by TCAG and approved by its
Policy Board and by the Authority.

PUC 180000 includes provisions regarding the number of members on the Authority Board. Specifically, the
Authority will be represented by thirteen (13) members including:

•	Five (5) members of the Board of Supervisors

•	One (1) member representing each of the eight cities in Tulare County: Dinuba, Exeter, Farmersville, Lindsay,
Porterville, Tulare, Visalia and Woodlake consisting of members of the city council appointed by the city council

The three (3) at-large members of TCAG will not participate as members of the Authority in accordance with the
intent of PUC 180051. Alternates to the regular members of the authority may participate in accordance with the
TCAG By-Laws.

Plan Update, Approval Process, and Expenditure Plan Amendments

Plan Review and, approval process

There are three primary reports/plans that are referenced as follows:

1.	The Expenditure Plan - The Expenditure Plan is approved by the voters and may be amended once a
year as outlined below.

2.	The Annual report - The Annual report is prepared each year by the Citizen’s Oversight Committee to
provide review how sales tax receipts are being spent and publicize the results

3.	Bi-Annual Strategic/Work Plan - Prepared every two years to outline project expenditures. The Strategic
Plan will be timed to coincide with the development of the Bi-annual State Transportation Improvement Program
development.

In compliance with schedules mandated in federal and state law, TCAG regularly prepares a new long-range
transportation plan (RTP) that updates and renews a list of candidate projects for all transportation modes
(streets, highways, public transportation, bikeways, aviation, etc.). If funds are available for any projects beyond
those now listed Table 1 in this Expenditure Plan, they will be drawn from that list. TCAG will have the option of
issuing bonds to deliver Measure projects and programs contained in this Expenditure Plan to reduce project
costs by delivering them earlier.

All updates of the Expenditure Plan will be subject to public review and public hearings. While these candidate
projects may change and priorities for funding may occur, there are more than enough project needs within the
County to be addressed using all types of funding, including Measure funds. It will be vital during development of
each Expenditure Plan Update to consider financing all transportation modes in order to insure a balanced and
efficient transportation system. All of the projects and programs included in this Expenditure Plan are considered
essential to meet the transportation needs of Tulare County.

Amendments to	the Expenditure Plan

The TCAG Board may annually review and propose amendments to the Expenditure Plan to provide for the use
of additional Federal, State and local funds, to account for unexpected revenues, or to take into consideration
unforeseen circumstances. In order to react to changes in funding and/or priorities, an amendment to the plan can
be proposed. Amendments will require the same voting requirements that TCAG used to adopt the original
Expenditure Plan.

Bi-Annual	Strategic/Work	Plan

The following steps will be taken by TCAG to prepare and adopt this and future Strategic Plan/biennial updates of
the Transportation Measure Strategic/Work Plan. This will include a financial plan that coincides with the
development of the State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP).

•	TCAG staff working with member agencies and affected stakeholders will develop the Draft Strategic/Work
Plan, and will update it every two years

•	The TCAG Policy Board receives the Draft Strategic/Work Plan and its updates and schedules public
hearings to review the Plan

•	The TCAG Policy Board adopts the Strategic/Work Plan

Independent Financial Audits

If the Measure is approved by the voters, TCAG would conduct independent financial audits consistent with PUC
180000 et seq.

Implementing Guidelines

Administration Program: -1% of the Measure

There are a number of processes that TCAG must also perform to support the Measure Program including
maintenance of the Expenditure Plan and development of requirements associated with:

•	Each of the proposed allocation programs

•	The identification and prioritization of projects

It is recommended that TCAG be allocated 1% of sales tax revenue to address important activities. Activities of
TCAG are described below:

>	Prepare Annual Work Program and Budget

>	Develop the Allocation Program requirements including focused studies needed to implement Measure
programs

>	Prepare the Strategic/Work Plan every two years

>	Develop the priority list of regional capacity increasing and rehabilitation projects

>	Conduct an independent audit of Measure programs and funds on an annual basis

>	Conduct an on-going public outreach program

>	Issue bonds to deliver Measure projects and programs contained in this Strategic/Work Plan to save
project costs by delivering them earlier

>	Allocate Measure proceeds to the local jurisdictions consistent with the Program requirements

Measure R - Final 2006 K Cent Transportation Sales Tax Measure Expenditure Plan

Bonding and Financing

TCAG will have the authority to bond and use other financing mechanisms, including, when more advantageous
economically, loans from banks and other financial lending institutions, for the purposes of expediting the delivery
of transportation projects and programs and to provide economies of scale. Bonds or loans, if issued, will be paid
with the proceeds of the transportation sales tax. The costs and risks associated with the bonding and loans will
be presented in Strategic/Work Plan, and will be subject to public comment before any bond sale or loan
application is approved.

TCAG will also be able to use other means to accelerate the delivery of projects and programs, including
partnering with other COGS, the State of California, the Federal Government, and other government agencies,
federal authorization funds, federal earmarks, partnering with private entities, seeking outside grants and
matching or leveraging tax receipts to the maximum extent possible.

Local agencies may choose to advance funds for a project, either a project specified in the plan, or a project for
which they plan to use their local agency Local Program funds, and to receive reimbursement for that
advancement in accordance with the plan. The fund advancement and reimbursement projections must be
approved by TCAG in accordance with the voting requirements, prior to proceeding with the project.

Contingency Fund

TCAG will also have the ability to set aside a contingency fund of up to 5% of the annual receipts from the tax.

Revenues to fund the contingency may be accumulated through the following: revenues exceed projections or a
project’s cost is lower than anticipated resulting in excess funds.

In the event that actual revenues in any given year are less than the budgeted revenues, the TCAG Board may
use the contingency fund to make up the difference between the budgeted revenues and the actual revenues.

The contingency fund may also be used to fund projects where the actual cost exceeds projections.

Accountability

All business of TCAG will be conducted in an open and public meeting process in accordance with the California
Brown Act. TCAG will approve all spending plans described in this document and will ensure that adequate public
involvement has been included in the preparation of all spending plans. TCAG will be required to hire an
independent auditor who will annually audit all sales tax expenditures, ensuring that expenditures are made in
accordance with the plan, and with prudent, established accounting regulations and practices.

Other Guidelines

This plan is guided by principles that ensure that the revenue generated by the transportation sales tax is spent in
the most efficient and effective manner possible, consistent with the desires of the voters of Tulare County. The
principles outlines in this section provide flexibility needed to address issues that may arise during the life of the
plan.

1.	TCAG	will	fund both regional and local projects, and will also provide funds to local agencies to

address special and localized needs.

2.	TCAG	is	charged with a fiduciary duty in administering the transportation sales tax proceeds in

accordance with the applicable laws and this Expenditure Plan. Receipt of these tax proceeds may be
subject to appropriate terms and conditions as determined by TCAG in its reasonable discretion,
including, but not limited to, the right to require recipients to execute funding agreements and the right
to audit recipients’ use of the tax proceeds.

3.	The	monies	collected	through	TCAG shall be accounted for and invested separately, unless and until

the funds are turned over to a local agency in accordance with the plan. At such time, the local
agency shall keep a separate accounting of the monies and any and all expenditures to ensure that
the monies are spent in accordance with the approved expenditure plan.

Measure R - Final 2006 K Cent Transportation Sales Tax Measure Expenditure Plan

4.	All meetings of TCAG will be conducted in public accordance to state law, through publicly noticed
meetings. The annual budget of TCAG, annual work plan, biennial Strategic/Work Plan, and annual
report will all be prepared for public scrutiny. The interests of the public will further be protected by the
Citizens’ Oversight Committee described in this Plan.

5.	Under no circumstances may the proceeds of this transportation sales tax be applied to any purpose
other than for transportation improvements benefiting Tulare County and its member agencies. The
funds may not be used for any transportation projects or programs other than those specified in this
Plan without an amendment of the Expenditure Plan.

6.	Actual revenues may be higher or lower than expected in this Plan, due to changes in receipts and/or
matching or leveraging capability. Estimates of actual revenue will be programmed annually by the
TCAG during its annual budget process.

7.	The actual requirements for funds in a specific program could be higher or lower than expected due
to changes in funding outside of this transportation sales tax, or due to changes in project costs or
feasibility. Should the need for funds for any program/project be less than the amount to be allocated
by the sales tax, or should any project become infeasible for any reason, funds will first be considered
for reprogramming to other programs or projects in the same urban area in accordance with voting
described above at a noticed public hearing. Should the need for funds in the entire area be less than
the amount to be allocated by the transportation sales tax, the TCAG Board may amend the
Expenditure Plan to reallocate funds to the other projects following its procedures for a plan
amendment.

8.	All projects funded with these transportation sales tax funds will be required to complete appropriate
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and other environmental review as required.

9.	Funds may be accumulated by TCAG or by recipient agencies over a period of time to pay for larger
and long-term projects. All interest income generated by these proceeds will accrue to the specific
fund/project intended. If accumulated for a general purpose, the proceeds will be used for the
transportation purposes described in the Expenditure Plan.

10.	TCAG will have the capability of loaning transportation sales tax receipts at prevailing interest rates to
other member agencies for the implementation of needed transportation projects, provided that a
guaranteed revenue stream is devoted to repay such a loan over a maximum amount of time, and
provided that the loan will not interfere with the implementation of programs or projects defined in the
Expenditure Plan. Loaning of funds requires TCAG Board approval.

11.	Matching or leveraging of outside funding sources is strongly encouraged. Any additional
transportation sales tax revenues made available through their replacement by matching funds will be
spent based on the principles outlined previously in these guidelines. A member agency may elect to
advance Tier I Regional Project using local funds. The agency would be eligible for repayment for the
amount advanced (with no interest) subject to TCAG approval of the advancement and the year of
reimbursement.

12.	For Transit/Bike/Pedestrian projects shown on Table 5, obtaining outside funding or grants is
encouraged. For every dollar of sales tax funding saved by an agency through obtaining outside
grants, 50% will be provided to that agency’s Local Program fund. (Excludes: CMAQ, TEA, FTA
5307, and FTA 5311 or other state/federal grant administered through TCAG). The other 50% would
be placed in the Local Program fund to be distributed among all agencies. Examples of eligible
grants include but are not limited to: State of California Bike Lane Account funding, Federal
Recreation trials Program, and Federal Transit Administration new starts program.

13.	For	'Regional	Projects'	shown	on	Tables	1	and 2, obtaining third party grants by member agencies is

encouraged so as to leverage sales tax revenue and expedite completion of projects. All funds
generated by such third party grants solicited for specific regional projects shall be applied solely to
those projects. TCAG will give preference to use the savings resulting from said grants toward other
regional projects which primarily benefit the member agency responsible for obtaining said grants.
Grants, as applied to the foregoing, do not include STIP funds.

14.	New	incorporated	cities	or	new	transit	agencies	or	services	that come into existence in Tulare County

during the life of the Expenditure Plan could be considered as eligible recipients of funds through a
Plan Amendment, and an additional position created on the governing board.

Measure R - Final 200614 Cent Transportation Sales Tax Measure Expenditure Plan

Appendix B — Implementing Guidelines

The following Implementing Guidelines are intended to "guide" development and implementation of the measure program for Tulare
County. Each of the three (3) transportation funding programs is described below. Implementing Guidelines for the fourth program
(Administration/Planning Program) are described in Appendix A.

1. Regional Project Program (Regional Transportation Program)- 50% of the Measure

The Expenditure objectives are to:

•	Provide additional funds to make up anticipated shortfalls to meet regional street and highway
improvement needs

•	Leverage Local Program state and federal funding from the California Transportation Commission (CTC)

•	Accelerate delivery of street and highway projects that may otherwise be delayed because of other
funding shortages

The program would provide funds for:

•	Additional lane capacity on existing regional streets and highways

•	Major Interchange improvements

•	Other improvements which improve mobility performance on the regional system

Eligible expenditures for Phase 1 and Phase 2 projects would include all recognized project phases including:

•	Planning and environmental analysis

•	Preliminary engineering

•	Design

•	Right-of-way acquisition and relocation

•	Utilities relocation

•	Construction & Construction Engineering

In addition to Transportation Measure funds, the Regional Projects Program would require the partial allocation of
State Transportation Improvement Program funds available to Tulare County to regional capacity increasing
projects. These funding sources together result in slightly more than $903 million available for Phase 1 and
Phase 2. Phase 2 projects are considered for advancement if additional funding is available and the projects are
amended in to the current Regional Transportation Plan. During preparation of the biennial Strategic/AA/ork Plan
Updates, TCAG will develop a detailed improvement program that specifies the timing and delivery of projects or
funding order considering project cost benefit, project readiness, and funding availability.

Measure R - Final 200614 Cent Transportation Sales Tax Measure Expenditure Plan

2. Local Transportation Program - 35% of the Measure

This program would augment:

•	Existing local, state, and federal funds for local streets and roads

•	Any other form of transportation that provides funding for transportation projects of significance to local
agencies

•	Local Transportation Impact Fees

The improvements in this category are not limited to just the concept of rehabilitation. The funding is available to
all jurisdictions to address their respective needs. This program will provide "flexible funding" for:

•	Meeting scheduled maintenance needs

•	Rehabilitating the aging local	system

•	Pot hole repair

•	Signals

•	Safety Improvements

•	Bridge replacement

•	New local road	capacity

•	Maintenance and rehabilitation projects

•	Separate street traffic from increasing rail traffic (railroad grade separations)

•	Signal Synchronization

•	Other improvements directly or indirectly related to transportation

As with the Regional Projects Program, funds could be used for all needed phases of project development and
implementation.

3.	Transit/Bikes/Environmental Mitigation Program (Public Transportation Program) -14% of Measure

The program would include funding augmentation to existing transit operators to maintain basic transit services to
meet the needs of:

•	Public transit

•	Those who are	unable to drive

•	Those who choose an alternative to the use of private automobiles for work and shopping trips

The program includes funding for:

•	Bicycle projects

•	Pedestrian improvements

•	Environmental Mitigation

•	Light Rail

The Environmental Mitigation funds would be applied to an environmental mitigation bank that would encompass
the projects and programs that may be funded with Measure assistance. This program would also reduce the
time and significant delays associated with the current process of securing approval of affected resource
agencies.

As with the Regional Projects Program, funds could be used for all needed phases of project development and
implementation. In addition to Measure funds, the Regional Projects Program would require the partial allocation
of Regional CMAQ/TE funding administered through TCAG. These funding sources together result in slightly
more than $132 million available forTransit/Bikes/Environmental projects.
