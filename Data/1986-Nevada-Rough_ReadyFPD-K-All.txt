is utilized to meet normal operating expenses, i.e. insurance premiums, workmen's
compensation premiums for oil volunteer fire and rescue personnel, maintenance
of existing equipment purchase of supplies, fuel and miscellaneous fire and rescue
equipment. Additional funding is mandatory to insure continued quality fire and
rescue services.

Impartial Analysis for Measure K

COUNTY COUNSEL'S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS PURSUANT TO
ELECTIONS CODE SECTION 3781 OF THE ROUGH AND READY
FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT SPECIAL TAX ELECTION

The Rough and Ready Fire Protection District seeks voter approval
of an ordinance imposing a special tax upon real property located
within the boundaries of the District. The revenues raised by
this tax are to be used solely for the purpose of purchasing fire
suppression and rescue equipment for a period of fifteen (15)
years.

Under the California Government Code Section 53978, the District
is authorized to enact an ordinance imposing a special tax if
approved by no less than two-thirds of the voters casting votes
thereon. If approved by the voters, the special fax will be levied
on all real property within the District which is subject to taxation
in the following manner:

Each improved parcel would be assessed at a rate of
$40.00 per year.

Each unimproved parcel would be assessed at a rate

of $15.00 per year.

The proposed ordinance will also authorize an increase in the
District's spending limit as established pursuant to California
Constitution Article XIII B in an amount which coincides with the
revenue raised by this special tax. By law this appropriation in-
crease would be valid for a maximum period of four years.

The ordinance would authorize the District's Board of Directors
to have the special taxes collected by the Nevada County Tax
Collector and provides that such expenses shall be paid out of the
proceeds of the special tax.

The ordinance provides that it will become effective as of Novem-
ber 5, 1986, if approved by the requisite two-thirds (2/3) vote.
The ordinance further provides that it shall automatically expire
on January 1, 2002.

Dated: August 26, 1986

County Counsel

Argument in Favor of Measure K

The Rough & Ready Fire Protection District is requesting a
special tax be levied on all parcels within its District to raise funds
for the purchase of special fire and rescue equipment. The funds
will be used solely for the replacement of antiquated equipment,
over a fifteen year period. Two of our first-line engines are over
30 years old, and our rescue vehicle is over twenty years old.
Present funding is sufficient for normal operations, but mainte-
nance costs are increasing as present equipment ages. In order to
maintain the pre-Proposition 13 quality of protection, equipment
replacement is essential.

Ordinance 86-01 calls for each improved residential parcel to
pay $40.00 per year, payable semi-annually; unimproved parcels
would pay $15.00 per year. This special tax would expire in
fifteen years.

In addition to present County funding, efforts by the volunteer
firemen, their families and residents raise money from a variety of
community efforts. The Fire District has only volunteer personnel.
The Board of Directors consists of five members of the community,
elected by the residents, who also serve on a volunteer basis. The
money generated by a special tax would benefit no individual - it
is intended for the benefit of all residents and property owners of
Rough & Ready.

WHY DOES THIS NEED EXIST? One Big reason is Proposition
Thirteen which cuts funds for fire districts. I am sure none of us
anticipated the cuts to be directed to such a critically needed
public service, nevertheless, they were. Revenue increases since
1979 have been sufficient to cover operational increases to date,
but in order to replace vehicles, more money is needed.

The1 Rough & Ready Fire Protection District urges every voter
to vote YES on this measure; a 2/3 vote is necessary to pass it.

Thank you for your support,

/s/ Dale Simmons, Chairman
Board of Directors

Rough & Ready Fire Protection District
