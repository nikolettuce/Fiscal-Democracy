CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE E

Under Articles 13A and 13C of the California Constitution, local special taxes
require two-thirds voter approval. The City Council is placing this proposition
on the ballot to allow the voters to decide whether to approve a parcel tax for
special library purposes. The proposition defines special library purposes as the
acquisition, lease, construction, operation and maintenance of library facilities,
including the cost of fixtures, furnishings, books, and other resources to be used
for the provision of special libraiy services in the City.

If approved by two-thirds of the voters, the proposition would allow the collection
of a parcel tax at a rate not to exceed $45 per parcel in the City of Agoura Hills.
The City Council is authorized to establish the specific tax rate up to $45 per
parcel. The City Council also is authorized to repeal the tax. Any tax in excess
of $45 per parcel would require voter approval of another ballot measure. The
tax would stay in effect only until June 30,2003, at which time it could be extended
only pursuant to all applicable procedures then in effect. The proposed tax is
estimated to raise approximately $270JQ.0Q.of-tax_rexsiiues per year Jor special
library purposes in the City.	2-——~~zp>

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE E

If you spent your childhood learning to love books in your neighborhood library,
raise your hand. Great! So did we!

Years.ago, when our community was smaller, perhaps the little library on
Roadside Drive was adequate. But while Agoura Hills has grown into a wonderful
city, the now aged Las Virgenes library has stayed the same. Both the interior and
the tiny parking lot (only 27 spaces) are bursting at the'seams.

“Yes” on Measure E means that our new library will finally happen!

-	The annual assessment of only $45/year is LESS THAN $4/MONTH.

-	It is a “special” assessment,- absolutely RESTRICTED TO LIBRARY
PURPOSES. Funds cannot be used for any other purposes whatsoever.

-	It commences in the fall of 1998 and ENDS IN FIVE YEARS.

Haven’t our families waited long enough? As we are poised to enter the 21st
century, what greater investment can we make than in a library to serve the needs
of the 21st century? A place that exists for no other reason than to feed
imagination and curiosity, students’ need to know, businesses’ need for
information, the needs of everyone from toddlers to seniors to be intellectually
and culturally nourished.

-	Did you buy two bestsellers this year? You likely paid more than this assessment
which will bring an ENTIRE NEW LIBRARY to you!

-	Did you buy two Thousand Oaks library cards so at least two of your family
members could use their large library? You are paying T.O. $110/year! That’s
more than double the Measure E assessment.

It’s time for Agoura Hills to have our own full-sized, state-of-the-art library! It’s
no luxury. It’s our obligation to our and our children’s future.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE E

PLEASE VOTE “NO” ON E.

Measure E doesn’t guarantee a new library. It’s an ill-conceived, emotional

attempt to extract more money from already-overtaxed taxpayers.

While a new library may be appealing, so is a nicer home, better car, and more

money for our families. Residents and businesses plan, prioritize, save, and live

within budget. So should our city.

The facts speak for themselves.

-	WE ALREADY PAY ENOUGH TAXES. New taxes encourage continued

irresponsible spending. Our council has wasted millions that could have built
a new library already. We already pay LA county library taxes; we shouldn’t
pay twice. .	,

-	WE CAN HAVE A NEWLIBRARY WITHOUT NEW TAXES, this century

j	not next, if our council approves just one pending shopping center. Oiie,

J	Riverwalk Promenade, offers a free new library plus $1.5 million for land/street

;j	improvements. Action on thoughtful economic development means millions in

j	additional city revenue, letting Agoura Hills prosper like Westlake Village and

Calabasas.,	•

-	THERE’S NO LIBRARY PLAN OR GUARANTEES

j1	Councilmembers/staff don’t even have a legitimate plan. We repeatedly

|	requested their library plan and cost estimates, but received no answers (just

j;	1992 blueprints, two old memos) by rebuttal deadline. This tax falls short of

1988 estimates. They can use the taxes for “any library purposes” (e.g.,
maintenance), shifting existing county library taxdollars to other uses in “fiscal
j shell games”. Prop BB proves politicians misuse even “designated” taxdollars.

They should plan and approach a new library sensibly and responsibly, without
:	new	taxes.

ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE E

WE URGE YOU TO VOTE “NO” ON MEASURE E.

-	WE ALREADY PAY ENOUGH TAXES

Taxes are meant to fund essential public services, for which we’re already taxed
sufficiently. Tax-and-spend bureaucrats love exploiting special ‘pennies-a-day’
taxes with emotional appeal—libraries, schools, sheriff, fire. We already pay
enough taxes—over 50%+ of every dollar we earn.

-	WE CURRENTLY PAY L.A. COUNTY LIBRARY TAXES.

We shouldn’t pay twice for the same services.

-	WE CAN GET A NEW LIBRARY FOR FREE

Several pending shopping centers, like Riverwalk Promenade, offer to build a
20,000 square-foot library and contribute $1.5 million to the city for land, at no
cost to taxpayers—a win-win, sensible approach. We shouldn’t pay for a new
library when we can get one for free.	-

-	THOUGHTFUL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELIMINATES NEED
FOR NEW TAXES

Even one of three pending centers will bring the city millions in additional
revenue. We won’t need new taxes.

-NEW TAXES ENCOURAGE CONTINUED IRRESPONSIBLE
SPENDING

-	Promising a library for years, councilmembers could’ve built a library with
millions they’ve wasted on lawsuits, high staff salaries/benefits, unbid contracts,
community center outside city, pet projects,

-	They’re spending the remaining unrefunded $2.4 million utility tax ‘windfall’
for unspecified non-voter-approved purposes, instead of a library, seeking
more, in a ‘fiscal shell game’.

-	Councilmembers admit this parcel tax falls short of what’s needed (past
estimates exceeded $3+ million). They don’t promise what happens to the
money if the library isn’t built. If utility tax refunds are any indication, our
council can’t be trusted.

-	Nearby LAUSD’s recent Prop BB proves bait-and-switch politicians misuse
even “designated” taxes.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE E

What kind of community do you want for your family? Agoura Hills is filled with
people who moved here for our high quality of life, great schools and safe
neighborhoods.	'

WHAT DO WE STILL LACK? An adequate library. One large enough to offer
the materials and technology kids need to meet the competitive pressures on them
as they prepare to enter the next century. Our deteriorating Las Virgenes library
is way too small, and just plain worn out. It has already outlived its replacement
date by nearly 20 years.

-	Agoura Hills owns a beautiful DONATED 6-ACRE SITE waiting just west of .
the Spectrum Club.

-	ARCHITECTURAL PLANS can be viewed at city hall.

-	Library taxes paid by Agoura Hills residents to L.A. County will be used by the
COUNTY TO OPERATE, staff and stock our new library.

-	But there are NO COUNTY FUNDS TO BUILD IT. That’s up to us and

Measure E.	•	,	^	::

As for opponents’ reference to a “free” developer-funded library, there is NO
approved project in Agoura Hills which includes a library, nor any certainty that
one will ever come along. There’s no such thing as a “free” lunch.

Measure E’s $3.75/month is so little, and for only five years. Isn’t a fine library
worth a video rental? A magazine?

Aren’t our families, and community and cultural pride, worth much more than
that?
