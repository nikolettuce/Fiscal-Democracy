The City of Firebaugh has had a Utility Users Tax (UUT) of 10% in place for 28 years. The
UUT dollar amount is added to a customer’s utility bill. Under the existing UUT, the definition
of telephone usage is outdated and does not include wireless cellular phone usage and other such
wireless telephone communication services, which are not taxed.

If Measure____is approved, the existing UUT will be modified to add a new 5% UUT to

wireless telecommunication technologies such as wireless services, cellular phone, and other
voice over internet services. Traditional telephone services (provided via landline) will continue
to be taxed at the existing UUT rates.

If Measure____does not pass, the previous rules governing UUT payments will still apply. All

UUT revenues go to the City’s General Fund, which has experienced severe losses in recent
years. A significant majority of General Fund revenues pay for police and fire services.
Without these additional revenues, the future of these services is unknown.
