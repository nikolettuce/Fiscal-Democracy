3.	ARGUMENT IN FAVOR

CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE W

Ballot Measure W proposes to continue the existing one cent transactions and use tax (commonly referred to as the "sales tax") in
the City of Hollister beyond the current expiration date. The voters approved the sales tax in 2012 which is set to expire in March 31,
2018. Measure W would continue the one cent sales tax for up to an additional twenty years. Measure W does not increase the current
sales tax.

California Revenue and Taxation Code Section 7285.9 authorizes the City Council to extend a transactions and use tax, provided
they approve the ordinance extending the tax by a two-thirds Council vote and the extension of the tax is approved by a majority
of the City voters voting in an election on that issue. Measure W was placed on the ballot by unanimous vote of the City
Council to extend the sales tax.

Because Measure W does not limit the use of tax revenue, it is a “general tax,” not a “special tax” that restricts the funds to specific
purposes. The proceeds cannot legally be taken away by the State. If approved, one hundred percent of the proceeds of this local tax
would continue to go to the City’s general fund and will be available to support the full range of municipal services, including butnot
limited to police, fire, paramedic, streets, parks and recreation services, including youth, family and senior programs. If this tax
extension is not approved by the voters, the City will have to reduce essential services and cut programs.

A “Yes” vote is a vote to approve the extension of the voter-approved Measure W one cent sales tax for twenty years, with oversight
on the revenue and expenditure of funds from the tax by acommittee of members of the public pursuant to Hollister Municipal Code
§3.30.170. A “No" vote is a vote to not extend the existing tax and the existing tax would no longer be collected after March 31,2018.
Measure W will be approved if it receives a simple majority of ‘Yes” votes.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure W. If you desire a copy of the proposed ordinance, please call the City
Clerk's office at 831-636-4300, ext. 16, and a copy will be mailed at no cost to you.

Vote Yes on W - Continue existing, voter-approved funding, Protect Public Safety Services and Quality of Life -- with NO INCREASE
IN TAX RATE

Yes on W does NOT create a new tax. It simply continues existing, voter-approved local funding that the city has relied on since 2007
- with NO INCREASE IN TAX RATE.

MAINTAIN PUBLIC SAFETY- Make no mistake! We need Yes on W to prevent cuts to police, fire and prevention services that keep
our neighborhoods crime-free and our children safe:

Yes on W maintains rapid 9-1-1 emergency response times

Yes on W maintains operations at Hollister’s fire stations

Yes on W attracts/retains qualified police officers/firefighters

Yes on W prevents cuts to youth gang and drug prevention/intervention programs

Yes on W maintains youth programs at City parks and recreation centers

Because of voter action, Hollister became a community where people want to live and raise their families. Without continuing Measure
W’s voter-approved funding we will be unable to maintain these safety/prevention services. We don’t want Hollister to look like some
neighboring crime ridden cities, with gangs, graffiti, and rundown streets! Yes on W also fixes our potholes/roads and funds programs
to retain, expand, and attract businesses to Hollister.

FISCALLY ACCOUNTABLE - Yes on W includes strict accountability requirements:

•	Independent citizens’ oversight

•	Annual independent audits

•	All funds used for Hollister’s benefit

•	No funds can be taken by Sacramento politicians

Join police, firefighters, local business owners and community leaders in voting YES on W to protect and maintain Hollister’s public
safety and essential services, with NO INCREASE IN TAX RATE.
