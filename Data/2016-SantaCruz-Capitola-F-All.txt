Impartial analysis

The following impartial analysis of the measure was prepared by the office of the
Santa Cruz County Counsel:

// TEN YEAR EXTENSION OF CITY OF CAPITOLA QUARTER PERCENT
SALES TAX INCREASE

In 2004, City voters approved a temporary !4 percent sales tax (also known as the
transaction and use tax) increase, which was originally scheduled to sunset on June
30, 2010. In 2008, City voters extended the sunset date to December 31, 2017. As a
result of these two voter approvals the current sales tax rate in Capitola (combined
state and other local sales tax) is 8 3A percent. This ordinance, if adopted by the
voters, would extend the expiration date of this temporary sales tax increase for an
additional ten years, to December 31, 2027.

All City revenue generated by this sales tax is used by the City to pay for general
City programs and services, including public safety, wharf, beaches, parks, and
street and sidewalk improvements. As such, this ballot measure proposes a “general
tax” rather than a “special tax” and requires a simple majority vote for adoption.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of the proposed sales tax increase
ordinance.[2]

CAPITOLA MEASURE F (11/8/2016)

On July 28, 2016, the City Council passed a resolution (link below) to place a ballot
measure on the November 8, 2016, Municipal Election Ballot pertaining to extending
the sunset date on the existing one-quarter cent (0.25%) transactions and use
(“sales”) tax to maintain fiscal stability and protect essential City facilities and
services. Following is the ballot measure question:

Without increasing taxes, shall the City of Capitola extend the 2017 sunset
date of its current one-quarter percent sales tax for an additional ten years to
protect essential city services and facilities, such as police and emergency
safety programs, protect the wharf and beach from storms and rising sea
levels and maintain and improve parks, sidewalks and bike lanes with all funds
staying local?

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE F

Capitola is a wonderful place to live and visit. The many amenities that we enjoy
here - the beach, Soquel Creek, our parks, our walking town, the Wharf and our safe
community - they are all major parts of what we identify with as Capitolans.

Together we passed Measure D in 2008, a one-quarter cent sales tax, which
generates about $1.1 million a year. This tax will expire in 2017. Today, we
continue to have important needs, and we are asking you to vote to extend this tax
for ten years. This measure will support the following important projects:

Refurbish the Wharf, originally built more than 150 years ago, to protect it and
maintain it for future generations.

Preserve the beachfront, our creek, and lagoon from storms.

Ensure the Police Department is fully staffed, as has been achieved since the sales
tax was first enacted.

Improve our parks, sidewalks and bike lanes.

Capitola’s population swells in the summertime and expenses for public safety and
increased recreational activities skyrocket. We need a fully staffed Police
Department to ensure public safety year-round, including during periods of increased
demand each summer.

It is time for us to take care of the Wharf and beach for the next generation. With
sea level rise and a predicted increase in the frequency and intensity of storms, this
is an important issue for us. The City budget includes funds for minor Wharf repairs,
but major repairs are very expensive.

We want to provide our community with the highest level of service, PROTECT OUR
ENVIRONMENT and ENHANCE PUBLIC SAFETY. This small tax is spread across
a broad spectrum of people including tourists and visitors.

Please VOTE "YES" on this measure and help us continue to keep Capitola the
wonderful place that it is.
