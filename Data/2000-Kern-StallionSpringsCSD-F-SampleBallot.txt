IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL
STALLION SPRINGS COMMUNITY SERVICES DISTRICT MEASURE F

A “Yes* vote by at least two-thirds (2/3rds) of the voters voting on this measure
f^ll authorize the Board of Directors of the Stallion Springs Community Services
iJristrict ("District6) to collect a special tax levied in an amount not to exceed $50
per improved parcel of property per fiscal year and $25 per unimproved parcel of
property per fiscal year for the purpose of providing funds for police protection
services. The tyvo-thirds vote requirement for special taxes is mandated by Article
Xlll-A of the California Constitution.

On July 18,2000, the Board of Directors adopted an ordinance which authorizes
them to levy the special tax subject to approval by at least two-thirds of the voters
voting upon this measure. A copy of the ordinance is available at the office of the
Kem County Elections Department and at the District Office.

The special tax is for the purpose of providing police protection services. The
ordinance adopted by the Board of Directors provides that the proceeds of the
tax, if approved, will be used by the District solely for the purposes of obtaining,
providing, operating and maintaining police protection services including supply-
ing equipment or apparatus therefore; paying the salaries and benefits of police
protection personnel; and for other necessary police protection expenses of the
District.

The special tax will be collected in the same manner as property taxes. The
amount of the special tax shall not exceed $50 per improved parcel of property
per fiscal year and $25 per unimproved parcel of property per fiscal year. Parcel
of property for the purpose of the special tax shall mean any contiguous unit of
improved or unimproved real property held in separate ownership, including but
not limited to, any single family residence, or any other unit of real property. As
a matter of law, the special tax shall not be imposed upon a federal or state
governmental agency or local agency.

The measure also requests authorization to change the appropriations limit of the
District in an amount equal to the authorized aggregate amount of the special tax
approved by the voters. The appropriations limit is required by Article Xlll-B of
/jgre California Constitution and limits the amount of tax money that a governmental
.Ipity may spend in any year. If approved, the appropriations limit will be increased
lor a period of four years. The increased appropriations limit will have to be
approved again by the voters after the expi ration of four years if the District intends
to spend tax revenue in excess of its current appropriations limit as adjusted for
inflation and population changes over the next four years.
