Hawthorne City Clerk, Richard L. Mansfield at (310) 970-7921 and a copy
will 'be mailed at no cost to you.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION Q

Hawthorne is at critical crossroads. Our need for city services continues on
the increase. Yet, funds necessary to meet those needs have become more and
more scarce. We need your help.

Recently the City was notified that entrenched politicians in Sacramento
wanted to balance the State’s budget on the backs of cities. Enough is enough!
We are having our fair share of trouble making ends meet without their making
matters worse.

Over the past years your Hawthorne City Council has worked hard to meet
the needs of its citizens without increasing taxes. In fact, it has been a number
of years since any increase in City taxes has been levied.

However, we have met our limit. No longer can we cut and trim without getting
into essential services, such as police and fife. That is unacceptable. No one,
myself included, wants to raise taxes, but eventually reality sets in. Ultimately
we have to bite the bullet and do what’s best for our children and our
community.

On November 3rd you can make a difference. Your vote to increase the utility
users tax to 7% will enable our city to remain economically viable. Resulting
changes in your monthly utility bills will be pennies. Those pennies will add
up to valuable dollars needed to provide critical services for our citizens.

I am proud of Hawthorne and want to see it grow and be a city of which we
can continue to be proud. Your help in achieving this goal is urgently needed.
Please join me and my family and friends in voting YES on PROPOSITION
Q. You will be glad you did.

Enough is enough. Vote NO on Proposition Q.

Don’t these tax and spend politicians ever get the message? This is the fourth
time in four years that we have been asked to raise our own taxes.

Fortunately, we have defeated these attempts each time.

Hawthorne residents and businesses are sick and tired of paying higher taxes
and getting little in return.

WHY SHOULD WE DOUBLE OUR UTILITY TAX WHEN THERE IS NO
GUARANTEE THAT THE FUNDS WILL BE USED TO HIRE MORE
POLICE? This money could be used to increase pensions, settle lawsuits
- against the City or even redecorate offices.

Raising taxes in a slumping economy is foolish. It will cost us money and jobs.
Are the tax proponents so short-sighted that they don’t understand that?

Over 7,500 Hawthorne residents signed petitions supporting the building of
a card club here in Hawthorne that will bring 2,000 new jobs and millions of
dollars in revenue to the City, all without costing the taxpayers one dime!

Vote NO on Proposition Q NO ON UTILITY TAX INCREASES!

VOTE YES on Proposition P YES ON THE CARD CLUB!
