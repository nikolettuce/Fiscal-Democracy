IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL
COUNTY SERVICE AREA NO. 3
SPECIAL TAX MEASURE A

The Board of Supervisors of the County of Lassen has initiated proceed-
ings to form County Service Area number three (3) to provide extended
library services within such area under the authority of the County Service
Area Law, (Government Code S 25210 et. seq.) Measure A is submitted
to the qualified electors of each elementary school district within the County
for approval by two-thirds of the electors voting thereon within each re-
spective district. The Board of Supervisors has indicated its intent to further
utilize the results of this election to draw the boundaries of the proposed
County Service Area so as to include only those school district territories
in which Measure “A" is successful. Any territory in which the measure fails
is to be excluded from the County Service Area, and no library services
will be maintained within the area so excluded.

The background for this measure; is., .that, the . County , of Lassen is fiscally
unable to further maintain the Courity Free Library system wifhi'ri tile County, t
and various volunteer efforts and pledges, of financial participation have not
materialized as a means of permanent library support. The County Service
Area law has been chosen as a means of offering resumed library services
to residents of those areas of the County which indicate their wish to fund
such services. The basis for such funding is a special tax of $18.00 per
year on each inhabitable dwelling within the County Service Area as finally
formed. The revenues so derived could be used only for the purposes
defined by Government Code Section 25210.78a; (the payment of salaries
and benefits of library personnel, the acquisition or improvement of sites
for library buildings, the construction, alteration, repair or maintenance of
library buildings, or the acquisition, repair or maintenance of furniture or
equipment for library buildings, the acquisition, repair or maintenance of
library materials, or all or any combination thereof.) and would not be subject
to diversion or redirection by the State. The tax would be levied annually
on the lien date, March 1. The measure would have no effect on existing
law,

COUNTY SERVICE AREA NO. 3
APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT MEASURE B

This measure is a companion) tc>) Measure A, and establishes the appro-
priations limit for proposed Lassen County Service Area #3 as $200,000
per annum pursuant to California Constitution Article 13B, Section 4. The
appropriations limit would be effective for the three (3) fiscal years next
following its establishment and would thereafter be subject to change) by
the electors residing within the Service Area at an election called for that
purpose. The proposed appropriations limit is derived from the budget for
the County library budget for the last year of full operation, and the appro-
priations limit of the County of Lassen would be reduced by an identical
amount for fiscal year 1993-1994.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE A

There comes a time when a community must work together to fund ser-
vices that it values and to make sure that those services continue.

This is one of those times. We need to stand together to approve funding
dedicated to the continuation of our county library system and adult literacy
program.

Measure A proposes a conservative funding program. It asks each house-
hold to invest $18 annually into a fund that can only be used for the county
library program. This is less than the cost of most hardback books or one
family evening at the movies. But for this investment the community will be
able to continue a library and literacy program for the benefit of its citizens.

Measure A is the most reasonable way that we can assure that our library
services continue. The County and City have worked hard to maintain the
library, but the library has suffered increasing cutbacks, and the library sys-
tem is on the brink of closure. Without 2/3rd’s approval of Measure A in
elementary school-district areas, it looks as if there would be no public
libraries in Lassen County.

Please don’t let this happen. Show pride in Lassen County and in yourself
by supporting one of our community’s most valued educational and cultural
resources, its public library.

Please join us in approving Measure A. You will be proud you did.
