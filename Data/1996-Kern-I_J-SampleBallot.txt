IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL
MEASUREJ

[ i A ‘Yes” vote by. at least two-thirds of the voters voting on this measure will
s	authorize the Bear Valley Community Services district (“District”) to levy and <

collect annually a special tax hotto exceed Ninety Dollars ($90.00) on each parcel
I	of real property located within Improvement District No. 2 of the District. .

. ! . As a special tax, the proceeds must be earmarked for a specific purpose. The
''I	;	District intends to use the special tax revenue for the purpose of meeting debt

obligations of the District incurred with the issuance in i 995 of general obligation
1/ bonds in the principal amount of $3,5 Million by Improvement District No. 2. The
• i	District intends to use the revenue from the bond issuance for the purpose of

.!	i	purchasing real property and the water rights to that property, along with its

existing water system improvements. Revenue from the bonds will also be used
:	to install water system improvements, including pipelines, a reservoir, a pumping

/■- plant and three wells.	■	■	;

The 1995 bond issue was authorized by the voters in improvement District No. 2
in 1971, when the voters authorized an issuance of not to exceed $8.3 Million in
general obligation bonds for the purposes of acquiring, constructing, or improving
a water supply system, Prior to 1995, the District issued one bond measure in the
•;	•••	amount of $3.5 Million.

The bond debt is a general obligation of the District and may be financed by
property taxes levied'annually on taxable property located within improvement
j	District No. 2. The ad valorem property tax rate may be increased above one

j. ' percent (.1%) of assessed value for the period necessary to pay off the bond debt.

| j ' ' The District has proposed the special tax which is the subject of this measure to
provide ah alternative method of repaying the debt obligation incurred with the
|	•	. 1995 bond issuance. If this measure is approved, the bond debt will be satisfied .

through the annual levy of a flat rate of $90 on each parcel of real property located
within Improvement District No. 2, regardless of the assessed value of the -
■	.	property. If this measure is not approved, the bond debt will be repaid through ain	:

increase in the ad valorem -property tax rate on real property, located within
v--;’ Improvement District No. 2.
