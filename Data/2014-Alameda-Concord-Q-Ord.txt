WHEREAS, the Measure Q Continuation Measure requires independent Citizens’ Oversight,

promised; and

WHEREAS, if this Continuation is adopted, there is no increase in the tax Concord residents
currently pay; and

WHEREAS* if the Measure is approved, police patrols and gang prevention services, park and

WHEREAS, continued funding from this Measure will maintain after-school programs, anti-
gang activities, and recreation programs that keep youth and teens off the streets, out of trouble and
away from drugs and gangs; and

WHEREAS, the City wishes to continue to address service priorities that the public has
identified as being important to them, such as 911 emergency response times, neighborhood police

WHEREAS, Measure Q established a general transactions and use tax (“sales tax”) of one-
half of one percent (as authorized by Revenue and Taxation Code section 7285.9), which is codified at
Chapter 3, Article V, Sections 3.15.360 through 3.15.500 of the Concord Municipal Code; and

WHEREAS, although the revenues raised by Measure Q have helped the City stay solvent
during the period since it was adopted, Measure Q is scheduled to expire; and

WHEREAS, the City’s 10-Year Financial Forecast estimates that if Measure Q expires,
commencing in Fiscal Year 2016-17, $4 million in annual budget reductions will be required to
address the decline in City revenues currently received from Measure Q, which in turn will require the
City to make severe cuts to the services it currently provides, adversely affecting public safety
services including 9-1-1 emergency response times, police officers, gang prevention and crime
investigation services, and neighborhood police patrols, along with other City services, such as road
maintenance, youth sports and recreation programs, city parks and playgrounds, and senior services
and the Senior Center; and

WHEREAS, the extension of the sales tax initially authorized under Measure Q would ensure
fiscal accountability by requiring independent citizens oversight, mandatory financial audits, and
yearly reports to the community; and

WHEREAS, at its June 24,2014 meeting, the City Council adopted a budget for Fiscal Year
2014-15 that recognized the need for maintaining the revenue currently provided by Measure Q to
continue and preserve the level of services desired by residents of the City; and

WHEREAS, at a public hearing on July 29,2014, the Council considered placing a measure
on the ballot for the November 4, 2014 General Election seek voter approval of an extension of the
existing general transactions and use tax (“sales tax”) initially authorized by Concord voters as
Measure Q, extending that sales tax for a period of an additional 9 years, with no increase in the sales
tax that residents currently pay; and

WHEREAS, after that hearing, the City Council concluded that all of the information
presented indicated that, to obtain the revenue necessary to maintain and preserve service levels, the
Council should, at the November 4,2014 General Election, ask the voters of the City to approve a 9
year extension of the current one-half of one percent (.05%) local transactions and use tax initially

services and could not be taken away by the State; and

WHEREAS, on the basis of the foregoing, the City Council determined that it was appropriate
to place a measure before the voters at the November 4, 2014 general election regarding the extension
the current general transactions and use (sales) tax initially authorized by Measure Q; and

WHEREAS, the tax, if approved, would continue to be imposed on the sale of tangible
personal property and the storage, use, or other consumption of such property. The tax rate would
continue to be one-half of one percent (0.5%) (a half cent for each dollar) of the sales price^of the
property. The tax revenue would be continue to be collected by the State Board of Equalization and
remitted to the City. The tax extension would be in effect for 9 years, and would then expire
automatically. The tax shall be approved if the measure receives at least a simple majority of
affirmative votes; and

WHEREAS, the Concord City Council is authorized by California Elections Code Section
9222 to place measures before the voters; and

WHEREAS, Elections Code Sections 9281 through 9287 set forth the procedures for primary
arguments in favor of and in opposition to any City measure and for rebuttal arguments; and

WHEREAS, on May 27, 2014, the City Council adopted Resolution No. 14-31, calling for the
City’s General Municipal Election to be held on the same day as and consolidated with the Statewide

Section 11. The approval of this Resolution is exempt from the California Environmental
Quality Act (Public Resources Code §§ 21000 et seq., “CEQA,” and 14 Cal. Code Reg. §§ 15000 et
seq., “CEQA Guidelines”). The transactions and use tax to be submitted to the voters is a general tax
that can be used for any legitimate governmental purpose; to issue it is not a commitment to any
particular action. As such, under CEQA Guidelines section 15378(b)(4), the tax is not a project within
the meaning of CEQA because it creates a government funding mechanism that does not involve any
commitment to any specific project that may result in a potentially significant physical impact on the
environment. If revenue from the tax were used for a purpose that would have either such effect, the
city would undertake the required CEQA review for that particular project. Therefore, under CEQA
Guidelines section 15060 review under CEQA is not required.

Section 12. This Resolution shall become effective immediately upon its passage and
adoption.

PASSED AND ADOPTED by the City Council of the City of Concord on July 29, 2014, by
the following vote:

AYES:	Councilmembers	-	E. Birsan, D. Helix, L. Hoffmeister, R. Leone, T. Grayson
