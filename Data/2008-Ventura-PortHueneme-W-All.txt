CITY OF PORTHUENEME
IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY*

MEASURE"W"

Measure W proposes to raise revenue for general city of Port Hueneme
purposes by authorizing a 1/2 cent sales tax within Port Hueneme. The tax would
be paid in addition to current sales taxes and would be collected at the same
time and in the same manner as existing sales taxes. California law authorizes
the City Council to impose this sales tax, provided the tax is approved by a
majority of the voters.

Measure W would be a "general tax." Consequently, all revenue generated from
the proposed sales tax would be deposited into the City’s General Fund and
would be available for use by the City to pay for general City operations and
services. The City would not be legally bound in any way to use the tax monies
for any special purpose or for any particular facilities or programs. Since this
ballot measure proposes a "general tax" rather than a "special purpose tax," it
requires approval by a simple majority of the City’s voters.

A "yes" vote on Measure W favors adopting a one-half cent sales tax.

A "no" vote on Measure W opposes adopting a one-half cent sales tax.

* Section 9280 of the California Elections Code allows the City Attorney to prepare an
impartial analysis for each measure on the ballot.

CITY OF PORTHUENEME
TITLE AND SUMMARY PREPARED BY THE CITY ATTORNEY*
MEASURE "W"

AN INITIATIVE TO FUND GENERAL MUNICIPAL SERVICES IN PORT
HUENEME, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, POLICE PROTECTION AND
INVESTIGATIONS, REDUCTION OF GANG ACTIVITIES AND DRUG
RELATED CRIMES; RAPID RESPONSE TO EMERGENCIES; GRAFFITI
REMOVAL; SERVICES FOR SENIOR CITIZENS; AND MAINTENANCE AND
REPAIR OF CITY STREETS, BY ENACTING A ONE-HALF CENT
TRANSACTIONS AND USE TAX (SALES TAX) WITH ALL MONEY STAYING
LOCAL.

The purpose of this initiative is to place on the ballot a proposed ordinance that
would add a one-half cent sales tax to fund general municipal services. This
sales tax is an addition to the existing sales tax rate. If approved, the initiative
would amend the Port Hueneme Municipal Code establish sales tax related
definitions; require the City to contract with the State Board of Equalization to
perform all functions associated with the sales tax; require adherence to State
law regarding the collection and distribution of tax monies; and identify
exemptions and exclusions to the sales tax.

In accordance with Government Code § 53724 and Revenue and Tax Code
§ 7285.9, the proposed initiative was approved by 2/3 of the City Council.

*Pursuant to California Elections Code §9203, the City Attorney has prepared the
following title and summary of the chief purpose and points of the proposed measure.

If you desire a copy of the ordinance, please call the City Clerk's office at (805) 986-6503
and a copy will be mailed at no cost to you.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE "W"

Protect and maintain our essential community and public safety services - VOTE
YES ON W.

Yes on W preserves funding for essential police protection and investigation
services, the reduction of gang activities, graffiti, and drug related crimes.

Yes on W preserves services for senior citizens, families, and youth.

Yes on W preserves funding for the maintenance and repair of City streets.

The City faces a continual and growing General Fund deficit that will reach $1.9
million within the next 5 years if left unchecked. The City has taken action by
cutting positions, raising user fees, and eliminating salary increases for all but
most Police Department employees, all to maintain a minimally acceptable level
of service.

Unlike our neighbors, we don't have a shopping mall, an auto mall, or big box
stores to provide revenue - we're built out and there’s no place to put them.
Without the additional revenue generated by a half-cent sales tax, our remaining
essential services will be at risk of further cuts.

Unfair budget cuts and "takeaways" from the State over the years have taken
over $4 million from our City, and like many other cities in California, these cuts
have left our City with inadequate funding to address public safety and
community service needs.

Yes on W gives us local control over the funds this half-cent sales tax will raise
for our community. Every penny generated by Yes on W stays local and can't be
taken by Sacramento politicians.

Yes on W costs you very little - just 500 for every $100 of taxable merchandise
purchased. Prescription medicines, medical services, grocery food, and water,
sewer, trash, and all other utilities are all exempt from Measure W.

Please join us in voting YES ON W on November 4th, and lets win one for
Port Hueneme!
