WINDSOR FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT
MEASURE K

Shall Windsor Fire Protection District Ordinance No.

K 2006-01 be approved authorizing the District to, (a)
impose and levy an additional special tax with a maximum
rate (subject to adjustment for inflation) of $.04/sq. ft. for
residential properties, from $.05 to $.09/sq. ft. for commercial and
industrial properties, and $36 for mobile home spaces and vacant
parcels, and (b) increase its appropriations limit?

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE K

Right now, as you read this, the Windsor Fire Protection District has only two paid
firefighters on duty, just two paid firefighters to protect a population of 30,000
spread out over 30 square miles. That is why Measure K is on the ballot.

The number of calls for Windsor Fire Protection District services has more than
tripled since 1990. Calls have gone from approximately 1.4 calls per day to 5.4
calls a day, without additional paid firefighters. That is why Measure K is on the
ballot.

An independent study commissioned by the Town of Windsor found that Windsor
Fire Protection District’s resources are not enough to adequately protect residents.
Equally important, the independent study found that the Windsor Fire Protection
District is appropriately managing its limited fiscal resources. There is no misman-
agement — no waste whatsoever. That is why Measure K is on the ballot.

The Windsor Fire Protection District is attempting to upgrade service, on less
money than recommended in the independent study. Measure K is a parcel tax of
four cents per square foot of residential building square footage. Residents of
mobile homes pay a flat rate of $36.00 per year. The average homeowner pays
$72.00 per year.

The revenue from Measure K is earmarked to hire additional firefighters only.

Measure K is a major step to Save Windsor from a significant fire catastrophe, a
catastrophe waiting to happen with only two paid firefighters.

Measure K is endorsed by Windsor Town Councilmembers Debora Fudge, Steve
Allen, Sam Salmon, Lynn Morehouse and Warin Parker, Supervisor Paul Kelley,
former Supervisor Nick Esposti, and the Sonoma County Taxpayers Association.

The people of the Windsor Fire Protection District ordain as follows:
SECTION I. DEFINITIONS.

For the purposes of this ordinance, the following words and phases shall have

This ordinance is adopted pursuant to Article XIII A, section 4, Article XIII B,

Section 13862 of the California Health and Safety Code. Therefore, the District
must establish a larger stable source of supplementary revenue to assist in meet-
ing the costs of providing such services and exercising the other rights and powers
of the District.

SECTION IV. PURPOSE OF SPECIAL TAX.

The purpose for which the additional special tax shall be imposed and levied
is to raise revenue for the District to use in meeting the costs of (1) providing ser-
vices pursuant to Section 13862 of the California Health and Safety Code, and (2)
exercising other rights and powers granted to the District in Chapter 5 (commenc-
ing with Section 13860) of Part 2.7 of Division 12 of the California Health and
Safety Code.

SECTION V. SPECIAL TAX AUTHORIZATION AND LIMIT.

The Board of Directors is authorized to impose and levy the additional special
tax each year on each parcel of real property within the District, except parcels of
real property owned by a federal, state, or local agency, based on the use or right of
use of the parcel and for the purpose stated in Section IV of this ordinance. The ad-
ditional special tax may be levied at a rate not to exceed (subject to adjustment for
inflation) $.04 per square foot for residential properties, from $.05 to $.09 per
square foot for commercial and industrial properties (depending on actual use),
and a fiat rate of $36 for mobile home spaces and vacant parcels. In accordance
with Section 53739 of the California Government Code, the rate shall be adjusted
each year for inflation by an amount equal to the annual adjustment factor deter-
mined pursuant to Section 7902 of the California Government Code and applied by
the District to its appropriations limit. The additional special tax shall be imposed in
accordance with the schedule set forth in Exhibit “A,” attached hereto and incorpo-
rated herein by this reference. The Board of Directors shall set the rate of the addi-
tional special tax each year as provided in Section VI of this ordinance, provided
that in no year shall the rate exceed the maximum specified in this section.

SECTION VI. REPORT AND HEARING ON SPECIAL TAX.

Each year prior to the imposition of the additional special tax, the Board of Di-
rectors shall cause a report to be prepared showing each parcel of real property
subject to the additional special tax, the owner(s) thereof, the land use classifica-
tion or classifications applied thereto, and the proposed levy thereon. Where there
are multiple land uses on a parcel, more than one land use classification may be
applied to the parcel if necessary to reflect the risk associated with the parcel.
Upon receipt of the report, the Board of Directors shall set a date for a public hear-
ing thereon and shall cause notice of the hearing to be given pursuant to Section
VIII of this ordinance. At the public hearing, the Board of Directors shall set the rate
and make such corrections to the taxes proposed to be levied as may be required
to conform to the schedule set forth in Exhibit “A.”

SECTION VII. ANNUAL REPORT ON SPECIAL TAX REVENUES.

Each year the District shall cause a report to be prepared and filed with the
Board of Directors containing information regarding the amount of additional spe-
cial tax revenues collected and expended as well as the status of projects funded
with proceeds of the additional special tax.

SECTION VIII. NOTICE OF HEARING.

In the absence of state law specifying the procedure for giving notice, notice of
any public hearing held pursuant to this ordinance shall be given by posting in at
least three (3) public places within the District at least fifteen (15) days prior to the
hearing and publishing twice pursuant to Section 6066 of the California Govern-
ment Code in at least one (1) newspaper of general circulation within the District.
The notice shall include the date, time, and place of the public hearing, a general
explanation of the matter to be considered, and a statement of where additional
information may be obtained.

SECTION IX. COLLECTION.

The additional special tax shall be collected in the same manner and subject to
the same penalty as other charges and taxes collected by or on behalf of the Dis-
trict by the County of Sonoma. The Sonoma County Tax Collector may deduct rea-
sonable administrative costs incurred in collecting the additional special tax and
deposit the amounts deducted in the Sonoma County General Fund. In accor-
dance with Article 1 (commencing with section 29300) of Chapter 2 of Division 3 of
Title 3 of the California Government Code, there shall be added to the amount of

the special tax an amount for the reasonable administrative costs incurred in col-
lecting the additional special tax.

SECTION X. APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT.

The appropriations limit for the District shall be increased to the sum of
$5,000,000.00 for the maximum period permitted by law (four years) so the District
can spend all proceeds of the special tax.

SECTION XI. SEVERABILITY CLAUSE.

If any section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of this ordinance is for
any reason held to be unconstitutional and invalid, such decision shall not affect
the validity of the remaining portion of this ordinance. The people of the Windsor
Fire Protection District hereby declare that they would have passed this ordinance
and every section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase thereof, irrespective of
the fact that any one or more sections, subsections, sentences, clauses or phrases
be declared unconstitutional or invalid.

SECTION XII. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Ordinance shall take effect the day following its approval by two-thirds of
the District's qualified voters voting on its approval at the special election on No-
vember 7,2006.
