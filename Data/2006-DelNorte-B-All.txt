Norte County Ordinance Code, “Rate - Payment,” is hereby amended

For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is

<impartial> IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL
MEASURE B

The Del Norte County transient occupancy tax (TOT) is currently
8% of the rental charge on lodging in “hotels,” as defined in the
county ordinance. Measure B would increase that rate to 10% of
the rental charge. This increase would apply to the unincorporated
area of the County.

The Del Norte County Board of Supervisors has adopted
ordinance number 2006-12, which increases the TOT rate from 8%
to 10%. However, the ordinance also provides that it does not go
into effect unless it is approved by a majority of the voters.

A YES vote on Measure B would approve the amendment to
increase the County TOT rate from 8% to 10%.

A NO vote continues the County TOT rate at 8%.

Any new revenues from the increase from 8% to 10% are not
earmarked. They can be budgeted for any lawful county purpose
by the Board of Supervisors. <impartialend>

<fiscal> FISCAL IMPACT STATEMENT FOR MEASURE B

The transient occupancy tax is a tax imposed by the County of
Del Norte on persons renting rooms and other accommodations at
motels, hotels and similar lodging in the unincorporated areas of
Del Norte County.

The current transient occupancy rate is 8%. Approval of this
ballot measure will increase the rate to 10%. This increase will
generate approximately an additional $62,500.

Transient occupancy tax revenue is considered general purpose
revenue and can be used to support such activities as Sheriff, District
Attorney, Health, Mental Health, Social Services, Recreation and
Parks and tourism promotional agencies. There is no fiscal impact
on County residents unless they stay at a motel or hotel in the
unincorporated area of the County. <fiscalend>

<favor> ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE B

Vote YES on Measure B.

Measure B is Realistic.

Tourism helps support our economy. The Board of Supervisors
recently committed $62,000 per year to promote tourism in Del Norte
county.

But the influx of tourists has its costs. Local property tax payers
support many services that benefit the welcome travelers through
our community. The dollars must come from someone.

Measure B recognizes that tourists should be paying for some
of the services that protect them and enhance their experience here.

Measure B is Common Sense.

Throughout California, most local governments receive a 10%
transient occupancy tax. Locally, Crescent City and Humboldt County
are already at a 10% TOT. Many of the cities in Humboldt County
already charge 10%.

Travelers already expect to pay local taxes. It makes sense for
Del Norte County to have its tax rate in line with communities
throughout the state.

Measure B is Balanced.	
Vote YES on Measure B.	<favorend>
