IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL NORTH EDWARDS WATER DISTRICT MEASURE N	ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE N NORTH EDWARDS WATER DISTRICT
A “Yes” vote by at feast two-thirds of the voters voting on this measure will autho- rize the Board of Directors of the North Edwards Water District (“District”) to levy annually a special tax in the amount of up to $50.00 per lot or parcel of real prop- erty located within the boundaries of the District. The special tax, if approved, will be levied and collected for each of the four fiscal years commencing with the fiscal year beginning on July 1,2007.  The District intends to use the special tax revenues to construct, operate and maintain facilities of the District necessary for the continued provision of water services. The proceeds of the tax will only be used for those purposes.  The proceeds of the tax will be deposited in a separate account. The chief finan- cial officer of the District will file an annual report with the Board of Directors of the District. That report will contain the amount of funds collected and expended and the status of the projects authorized.  This measure also seeks voter approval for an increase in the District1 s appropria- tions limit in an amount equal to the proceeds from the proposed special tax for a four year period commencing on July 1,2007. Under article XIIIB of the California Constitution, each governmental entity that can levy a tax must have an appropri- ations limit. The purpose of the appropriations limit is to set the maximum amount of tax revenue that the District can spend in any fiscal year. The Constitution per- mits voters to authorize an increase in an entity’s appropriations limit for a maxi- mum of four years.  This wording applies to Measure N:  This is an impartial analysis of Measure N. If you want a copy of the District’s reso- lution ordering the election to vote on Measure N, please call Kern County Elec- tions at (661) 868-3590 or 1 -800-452-8683 and a copy will be mailed at no cost to you.	The District does not have sufficient revenue to cover the cost of water service to a the community. The District needs the revenue from the special tax to improve its * physical facilities, including its wells. Because the water service benefits all prop- erties that obtain water service. By collecting money through the special tax, the District will reduce the burden of the water rates paid by its customers while pro- viding quality service.  s/David P. Harrell
