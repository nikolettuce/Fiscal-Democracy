ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE

A YES VOTE FOR MEASURE __

A YES VOTE FOR OUR KIDS

Greenbrae and Kentfield have excellent public
schools in Bacich and Kent Middle School. For the past seven
years our schools have received supplemental funding through
the generosity of contributors to the Kentfield Schools
Foundation. However, as the gap between the State's allotment

902062-2001-043-7565f

3

11/05/86

to the District and actual expenses widens, it becomes
increasingly difficult to make up budget deficits in this
manner. The projected deficit without any new programs for

1986-87 is $___________ after	accounting	for all normal sources

of income, including spendable income from the sale of
Greenbrae School. The highly touted and highly publicized
Lottery will predictably provide only an additional
$__________■

Measure __ seeks to establish a more equitable and

reliable source of continued funding for our community's
elementary education programs. It is a per-parcel annual tax
of $97.00. Property owners age 65 and older may apply for an

exemption for their primary residence. Measure _____ will	last

for only five years. Funds will be used to maintain the
current high quality of education we enjoy in our District.

No new programs will be funded.

Our public schools add to the desirability of the
Greenbrae-Kentfield neighborhood. It is up to us, as a
communityJsaftifig responsible to its children and ourselves, to
maintain the excellence which the Kentfield School District
has achieved.

[Community members concerned for our schools have
generously contributed to help defray the cost of this special
election.]
