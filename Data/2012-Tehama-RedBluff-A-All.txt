MEASURE A

AN ORDINANCE OFTHE CITY OF RED BLUFF, CALIFORNIA
ADDING SECTION 21.22TOTHE RED BLUFF MUNICIPAL CODE

The People of the City of Red Bluff do ordain as follows:

1.	CODE AMENDMENT.

Section 21.22 is added to Article III of Chapter 21 of the Red
Bluff Municipal Code to read as follows:

§21.22. CAMPING SITES, CAMPGROUNDS AND
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE PARKS.

(A)	For purpose of this Article III of Chapter 21 of
the Municipal Code, relating to the Transient Occupancy Tax,
"hotel" shall be deemed to include camping sites and spaces
at campgrounds and recreational vehicle parks, so long as such
camping sites and spaces are occupied by transients or
intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling,
lodging or sleeping purposes.

(B)	Nothing in this Section 21.22 is intended to cause
any person who actually exercises occupancy of a camping
site or space at a campground or recreational vehicle park for
a period in excess of thirty consecutive days to pay a tax with
respect to the rent for any such excess days.

2.	FINDINGS.

The People of the City of Red Bluff find and declare as follows:

(A)	, The purpose of this ordinance is to ensure that transients
who exercise occupancy in commercial camping sites and spaces
at campgrounds and recreational vehicle parks will be subject to
the 10% transient occupancy tax on the same basis as transients
who exercise occupancy in any other hotel.

(B)	. This Ordinance is declaratory of existing law and of the
law as it has been in effect in the City since 1967.

(C)	. The People would have adopted this Ordinance even if it
were not declaratory of existing law.

3.	SEVERABILITY.

If any subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this
Ordinance is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable by
a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity shall not affect the
validity or enforcement of the remaining portions of this Ordinance,
It is the People's express intent that each remaining portion would
have been adopted irrespective of the fact that one or more
subdivisions, paragraphs, sentences, clauses, or phrases be declared
invalid or unenforceable.

The forgoing ordinance was adopted by the People of the City of
Red Bluff at an election held on November 6, 2012.

ATTEST:

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE A

Since at least 1965, the City of Red Bluff has imposed a Transient
Occupancy Tax ("TOT’) on “transients" (guests) for the privilege of
occupancy at “hotels” within the City. "Hotel" is broadly defined for
TOT purposes to include a wide variety of lodgings for transients.
Each hotel operator collects the TOT from the hotel’s transient guests
and remits the TOT to the City. Transient occupancies are generally
occupancies that last for 30 days or less and are not contracted for
more than 30 days.

A taxpayer has questioned whether the TOT applies to transient
occupancies of camping sites and spaces at campgrounds and
recreational vehicle parks. The City believes that, under existing law,
the TOT does apply to these sorts of transient occupancies. This
measure would clarify the definition of "hotel" to ensure that such
occupancies are taxable and would declare that such definition is
reflective of existing law.

This Measure would add a new Section 21.22 to the Municipal Code
to read:

"§21.22. CAMPING SITES, CAMPGROUNDS AND RECREATIONAL
VEHICLE PARKS.

(A)	For purpose of this Article III of Chapter 21 of the Municipal
Code, relating to the Transient Occupancy Tax, “hotel” shall be deemed
to include camping sites and spaces at campgrounds and recreational
vehicle parks, so long as such camping sites and spaces are occupied
by transients or intended or designed for occupancy by transients
for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes.

(B)	Nothing in this Section 21.22 is intended to cause any
person who actually exercises occupancy of a camping sites or
space at a campground or recreational vehicle park for a period in
excess of thirty consecutive days to pay a tax with respect to the
rent for any such excess days."

A YES vote approves the measure.

A NO vote rejects the measure.

Respectfully submitted,

APPROVED AS TO FORM:

Richard L. Crabtree, City Attorney

52-501

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE A

Since 1965 the City has levied a Transient Occupancy Tax (‘TOT")
on the fees charged by hotel operators for temporary (less than 30
days) lodging within the City. TOT monies are used to support City
services such as police and fire that may be impacted by visitor
activities. TOT revenue is also used to support local tourism and
visitor attraction activities.

There is a dispute regarding application of the City's TOT ordinance
to commercial campgrounds or RV parks. This ballot measure lets
the voters decide. Your “YES" vote makes it clear that the City’s
TOT ordinance applies to both hotels and RV parks. Visitors using
commercial RV parks impact City services in the same way as visitors
staying at local hotels. Fairness suggests that guests at both hotels
and RV parks should be subject to the TOT

This ballot measure will NOT increase current tax rates. If approved,
the ballot measure will simply clarify that commercial RV parks are
subject to the TOT. It is estimated that the City will realize
approximately $100,000 in new revenue annually if the TOT is applied
to commercial RV parks. These monies could be used to support
visitor attraction activities and City services.
