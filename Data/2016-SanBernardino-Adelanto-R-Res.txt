Measure_________—Commercial Marijuana Activity Excise Tax

Shall the Adelanto City Council be authorized to impose excise taxes,
with no termination date, on each commercial marijuana activity business
licensed or operating within the City of Adelanto in an amount of not more
than five percent of the gross revenue attributable to that business’s revenue

SECTION 3: Pursuant to Elections Code section 9282(b) and City Council Resolution
16-47, section 6, the City Council hereby submits the following argument in favor of the
measure for a Commercial Marijuana Activity Excise Tax:

Argument In Favor Of Measure________

Commercial Marijuana Activity Excise Tax

Submitted by the City Council for the City of Adelanto

The City of Adelanto (“City”) faces a significant budget deficit that threatens the viability of
this great City. Despite eveiy effort to cut costs and raise revenue, the City still faces deficits
that undermine essential services and threaten the health and of safety of the People of
Adelanto. The City is at a cross-roads and must find additional sources of revenue or risk
facing the potentially severe consequences of municipal bankruptcy.

The State of California recently adopted the Medical Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act that
authorizes and regulates commercial medical marijuana activities within the State. The
Adelanto City Council has determined that the medical marijuana industry will generate a
significant source of revenue that is taxable by the City.

As one of the first cities in the State to authorize and regulate commercial medical marijuana
activities, the City of Adelanto is on the cutting edge of this industiy. The City’s own
safeguards, coupled with State regulations, will create a safe and profitable environment for
businesses in the medical marijuana industiy to flourish. Consequently, the adoption of these
taxes will provide the City with a significant and much needed source of tax revenue without
having to tax the City’s citizens directly.

hi its ongoing efforts to address the City’s budget deficits, the City Council unanimously
supports these new taxes and respectfully requests that the People of Adelanto vote in favor of
this measure.

This is not a tax on the People of Adelanto.
