ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE "I

CITY OF OJAI
CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS*

MEASURE "I”

This Measure, if adopted, would approve a rate adjustment in the Tran-
sient Occupancy Tax (''TOT') to ten percent (10%), which is the current rate
and was approved by the City Council in 1994. However, based on various
court rulings and the imposition of Propositions 62 and 218, it is now neces-
sary to obtain voters' approval to tax rate increases.

This Measure would not impose a tax on Ojai’s residents or busi-
nesses. it would apply exclusively to tourists or transient occupants of hotels
(as defined in Section 8-1.404 of the Ojai Municipal Code) in the City of Ojai.
Such transients currently pay a ten percent (10%) tax and, therefore, this
Measure would not increase the existing tax rate.

The history of the TOT in Ojai dates back to its original inception in
October 1971. The ordinance, among other things, imposed a five percent
(5%) tax for the privilege of occupying a room or other living space in a
hotel, an inn, or a tourist home in the City, except where the occupancy was
for a period of more than thirty (30) days. In December 1975, the rate
was adjusted to six percent (6%), in April 1985, it was again adjusted to
eight percent (8%) and, in August 1994, the tax was increased to its current
rate of ten percent (10%). By way of reference, the neighboring cities of
Santa Barbara and Ventura have a 10% TOT which is the typical rate in
California. A number of cities, including Palm Springs, Pasadena and San
Francisco, have higher rates.

Under existing law, certain exemptions from the TOT are provided for
state and federal employees on governmental business and persons who
are not transient, as required by law. Further, the TOT sets forth the duties
of hotel operators, including registration, record keeping, reporting and remit-
tance of the tax to the City. There are also enforcement remedies that in-
clude penalties, interest and audit procedures. Any operator aggrieved by
any decision of the City's tax administrator is provided with an appeal process.
These original policies and procedures will be unchanged by this Measure,
(See Article 4, Sections 8-1.401 through 8-1.441 of the Ojai Municipal
Code.) The only issue for consideration is the rate of the TOT.

The TOT is a general tax used to meet the City's obligations to the
community in the provision of current and future vital public services, includ-
ing police, fire, storm drain and street maintenance, youth and recreation
programs, senior services, planning and growth management, and parks
and landscape maintenance, among other things.

The tax rate cannot exceed the maximum established by this Measure
without approval of a majority vote of the electors of the City of Ojai.

"The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure “I". If you desire a
copy of the measure, please call the elections official’s office at (805)
646-5581 and a copy will be mailed at no cost to you."

‘Section 9280 of the California Elections Code allows the City Attorney to prepare an Impartial Analysis for each
city measure appearing on the ballot.

This Measure, if adopted by the voters, will approve the continuation of
the City’s existing ten percent (10%) Transient Occupancy Tax ("TOT'). Approval
of the existing TOT rate will not tax Ojai residents or businesses. The
TOT applies only to transient guests at Ojai’s hotels, motels and inns. Voter
approval is intended to protect the tax from legal challenge.

Loss of the moneys collected by the TOT may hinder the City’s abil-
ity to provide vital public services necessary to protect community needs,
such as public safety services, storm drain and street maintenance,
youth and recreation programs, senior services, planning and growth
management and parks and landscape maintenance, which are dependent,
in part, on revenues collected from the TOT.

A YES vote on Measure T will allow the City to use the moneys collected
from the tax for such vital public services and will not result in the imposition
of any additional tax burden on the citizens of Ojai. Instead, tourists will be
obligated to pay for a portion of the services which they also utilize while
visiting our community. A ten percent (10%) TOT is customary in California
and will not discourage local visitor servicing businesses.

Adoption of this Measure by the voters will provide citizens' approval of
the ten percent (10%) TOT and will preserve the moneys necessary to provide
the existing level of essential public safety and other municipal services
provided to the community.

Remember, approval of the TOT will not tax Ojai residents or businesses.
We urge you to vote YES on Measure "I."

CITY OF OJAI CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS*  MEASURE “J"  This Measure, if adopted, would retroactively approve the City’s exist- ing Transient Occupancy Tax (''TOT') rate of ten percent (10%) from August 1994 to and including the effective date of this Measure. This Measure would not impose a tax on Ojai's residents or businesses. Instead, this Measure would validate the payment of a ten percent (10%) TOT by those visitors who have occupied hotels in the City since August 1994. Specifically, this Measure would retroactively approve Resolution No. 94-35, adopted by the City Council on June 28,1994, which provides for a ten percent (10%) TOT.  The TOT is a genera) tax used to meet the City’s obligations to the community in the provision of current and future vital public services, including police, fire, storm drain and street maintenance, youth and recreation programs, senior services, planning and growth management, and parks and landscape mainte- nance, among other things.  This Measure, if adopted, would have no impact on the existing TOT. It will provide voter approval of the law as it existed from August 1994 through the effective date of Measure "J".  "The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure "J". If you desire a copy of the measure, please call the elections official’s office at (805) 646-5581 and a copy will be mailed at no cost to you.”	.ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE ’’J1'  This Measure, if adopted by the voters, will retroactively protect the Cily of Ojai’s previously collected Transient Occupancy Tax ("TOT") against claims by transients. Approval of this Measure will not tax Ojai residents or busi- nesses. The TOT is paid exclusively by transient guests at Ojai’s hotels, motels, and inns, and has provided money to help pay for the necessary increases in public safety and other municipal seivices such tourism generates.  In the event of a legal challenge, the City of Ojai could incur significant legal fees to defend its TOT, including potential refund claims. The TOT collected in the past has already been expended on public services to the community. Any refunds of the TOT would be paid from current tax dollars paid by Ojai residents and business owners and would be refunded to tran- sient visitors who do not live or work in the City.  Loss due to claims for past taxes collected may hinder the City’s ability to provide vital public services necessary to protect community needs, such as public safely services, street maintenance, planning and growth management, parks, senior and youth facilities, and landscape maintenance.  A YES vote on Measure" J" will allow the City to use its tax dollars to provide vital public services rather than paying attorneys’ fees to defend lawsuits against the TOT or paying potential refund claims to transients who neither live nor work in the City.  We urge you to vote YES on Measure "J.”
