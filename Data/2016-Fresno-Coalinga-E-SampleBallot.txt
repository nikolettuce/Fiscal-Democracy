This measure was placed on the ballot by the City Council of the City of Coalinga. This
measure, if approved, would impose a tax on commercial marijuana operations wherein
every person engaged in commercial marijuana operations in the City shall pay an
annual tax as follows: twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per square foot used in connection
with each operation for the first three thousand (3,000) square feet of space, and ten
dollars ($10.00) per square foot for each additional square foot thereafter.

The purpose of this tax is to raise revenue to fund general municipal services. The City
of Coalinga has an overall deficit that exceeds $3,000,000.00. Payment of the tax shall
solely be the responsibility of the person or entity authorized to legally perform
commercial marijuana operations in the City of Coalinga.

A “yes” vote on this measure is a vote to approve the tax. A “no” vote is a vote to reject
the tax. This tax will take effect immediately upon approval by a majority of the voters. If
a majority of the voters do not adopt this tax, commercial marijuana operations may still
open in the City, regardless, without having to pay a revenue to the City.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Ordinance No. 789 or Measure

____. If you desire a copy of the ordinance or measure, please call the Fresno

County Clerk/Registrar of Voter’s office at 559-600-3011 or the Coalinga City Clerk
at 559-935-1533, extension 113, and a copy will be mailed at no cost to you.

Argument In Favor Of Measure_____	Rv	CLERK

^ DEPUTY

Measure_____is an annual tax of $25.00 per square foot for the first 3,000 square feet

and then $10.00 per square foot thereafter imposed on all commercial marijuana
operations in the City of Coalinga. The City Council of the City of Coalinga previously
voted to allow commercial marijuana operations in the City.

The tax will help fund basic City services such as public safety. The City has a current
deficit that exceeds $3,000,000.00. The City is operating under a “bare bones” budget
to continue City operations through the current fiscal year. The City’s need for additional
revenue is immediate and will become ever more pressing during this fiscal year and
next fiscal year. If a tax on commercial marijuana operations is not approved by the
voters, commercial marijuana operations will proceed in the City of Coalinga without any
financial benefit to the City. Your “yes” vote will show your support for protecting the
interests, values, quality of life, and health & wellness of the residents of the City of
Coalinga.

ARGUMENT AGAINST CITY OF COALINGA MEASURE TO AUTHORIZE TAXES ON
COMMERCIAL MARIJUANA OPERATIONS

The Coalinga City Council, despite strong community opposition, conspired to sell the
Claremont Custody Center to a business that violates federal law. Now they want
voters to condone this action. Do not be fooled, Coalinga voters should not vote to
balance the budget at the expense of decaying their struggling community. Bringing in
these businesses will provide lucrative life styles for a select few and the quality of life in
Coalinga will suffer.

Growing and distributing marijuana is against federal law. Condoning those activities
locally does not change that fact. Openly permitting the sale of illegal drugs will change
the family nature of the community of Coalinga.

Marijuana use by youth in Fresno County is already on the rise. In a 2014/15 report
there were 1,852 youths seeking treatment for drug addiction. Of these, 69% were
seeking treatment for marijuana addiction.

A permissive City and community attitude toward an illegal drug not only leads to
increased use by youth but has negative workplace impacts. Drug use in the
workplace has consequences for employers including personal safety, employee
impairment and increased absenteeism. A permissive culture that makes drugs more
readily available negatively impacts all families, including yours.

Interestingly, there is no mention of medical need or compassion in this measure, only
the need to generate money from drug trafficking and sales for the purpose of funding
more government. Voters should vehemently oppose this quick-fix scheme. These out
of town drug traffickers do not care about our community, but we do.

Law enforcement, business leaders, and educators agree this is a bad idea. Sheriff
Margaret Mims and Supervisor Buddy Mendes are opposed to this measure. Coalinga
businesses, neighborhoods and children are at risk, we cannot allow drug trafficking! A
NO vote is a vote against illegal drug trafficking in our City.

The undersigned proponent(s) or author(s) of the primary argument against a
ballot measure to authorizing taxes on commercial marijuana operations in the
City of Coalinga at the November 2016 Presidential General election for the City
of Coalinga to be held on November 8, 2016 hereby state that this argument is
true and correct to the best of their knowledge and belief.

Rebuttal Regarding Measure E

The Argument Against the City of Coalinga Measure E to Authorize Taxes on Commercial Marijuana
Operations is, for the most part, not factual and strictly opinion. The Coalinga City Council took action to
allow Medical Marijuana Commercial Cultivation and Manufacturing within the City. This measure has
nothing to do with whether the citizens are for or against allowing medical marijuana commercial
cultivation and manufacturing as it is already allowed by Ordinance. This measure simply addresses
whether or not to tax the operations. If this measure does not pass, the businesses will continue to
operate, but the City will not receive tax revenue from these operations. This tax revenue would be
deposited into the General Fund which funds Police and Fire services as well as other city operations.
Vote YES.

The undersigned proponent(s) or author(s) of the rebuttal to the argument against ballot
Measure E at the Presidential General Election for the City of Coalinga to be held on November
8, 2016 hereby state that this argument is true and correct to the best of their knowledge.
