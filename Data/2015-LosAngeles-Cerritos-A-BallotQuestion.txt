Ballot question

The question on the ballot:[2]

To assist in the recovery of expenses for providing general city services,
including police, library and park services, shall the City of Cerritos adopt
an ordinance increasing the existing Transient Occupancy Tax (which is a
hotel bed tax) from a rate of six percent (6%) to twelve percent (12%),
which is a rate closer to the average for other Southern California cities?[3]
