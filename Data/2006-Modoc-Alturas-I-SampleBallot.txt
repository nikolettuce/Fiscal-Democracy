IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE I

CITY OF ALTURAS

Measure I would authorize the City to increase the
supplemental charge on minimum monthly water rates
from the current rate of $0.50 per meter up to $1.50 per
meter to fund mosquito abatement in the City of Alturas
commencing June 15, 2006.

At an election held on April 8,1980, a ballot measure
was passed by the electorate of the City of Alturas that
authorized the City to add a supplemental charge of $0.50
to the minimum monthly water rate per meter to fund
mosquito abatement in the City of Alturas. On a later date
the 50-cent addition to the minimum water rate and the
mosquito abatement program were both discontinued.

On March 9, 2004, the City Council re-implemented the
50-cent supplemental charge to minimum monthly water
rates as authorized in 1980 and again commenced a
mosquito abatement program. The City has determined
that the 50-cent supplemental charge authorized in 1980
is not sufficient to cover the current and future costs of
the City’s mosquito abatement program.

Passage of Measure I will authorize funding to fully cover
the expected costs of mosquito abatement in the City
without the expenditure of City general funds.
