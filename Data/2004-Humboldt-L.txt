<impartial> COUNTY OF HUMBOLDT
TRANSACTION (SALES) AND USE TAX
MEASURE L
IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

A YES vote on Measure L will approve the adoption of an Ordinance
imposing a one-percent (1%) transactions and use tax on all retailers
doing business in Humboldt County, whether in the unincorporated
areas or within the cities. A transactions tax is a sales tax, due on the
gross receipts of any retailer from the sale of all tangible personal
property within the county. A use tax is an excise tax imposed on the
storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property
purchased from any retailer for storage, use or consumption within the
county. The Ordinance contains several exemptions and exclusions
from imposition of the taxes, including an exemption for sales of personal
property to be used outside the county, when delivered to such place by
the retailer or his agent. The tax would be collected and administered
by the State Board of Equalization.

This tax is a general tax not raised for a specific Purpose. Revenues
from the tax will be placed in the County’s discretionary General Fund
for general purposes. The county estimates that this tax will generate
approximately $12 million in revenue each year.

If approved, this tax would be imposed beginning on the first day of
the first caiendar quarter commencing more than 110 days after approval
of the Ordinance. The Ordinance will terminate on June 30 2009 at
which time collection of these taxes will cease, unless a new ordinance
is approved by the voters. The current Board of Supervisors by
Resolution has expressed its intent to cease collection of this tax if
notified that the State of California requires the proceeds of the tax to
be used for any purpose other than local government general purposes.

To become law, this Measure must approved by a majority vote of the qualified vote.

<favor> COUNTY OF HUMBOLDT
TRANSACTION (SALES) & USE TAX
ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE L

The State’s wanton disregard for its fiduciary obligations to local government
by imposing unfunded State mandates and withholding local tax dollars, currently
in excess of $14.5 million each year, has severely crippled Humboldt County.
Geographically remote and sparsely populated, our local government historically
reflects the independent and self-reliant character of its citizens by finding ways
to balance the budget without increased taxes. Humboldt County has maintained
stability and services through user fees, department consolidation, deferring
maintenance, a hiring freeze, depleting reserves, refinancing debt, budget cuts,
layoffs, early retirements, and temporary office closures. Despite these efforts,
maintaining the status quo without this tax revenue will be impossible when
county projections for year 2005 predict another budget gap of $7 million, meaning
budget cuts much deeper than anything we’ve seen to date.

Humboldt County for the first time must consider a 1 % local sales tax to counteract
the harsh realities of the State’s continual and unprecedented money grabs,
with a safeguard enabling the tax to be rescinded if the State attempts to take
any of the revenue this generates.

Without this one-cent sales tax essential services such as sheriff
patrol/investigation/jail, city police, juvenile hall/probation, district attorney, library,
streets, animal control, and parks/recreation will be in jeopardy of further cuts
and or elimination.

The County’s Budget Task Force and the Eureka Finance Advisory Committee
both recommend the 1% transaction (sales) and use tax as the most viable
and equitable solution toward countywide financial assistance. A YES vote on
Measure L will provide crucial funding for local services and give local
government a better chance to retain critical existing services. A defeat of Measure
L will inevitably result in further service and program reductions, with far reaching
negative impacts on Humboldt County's economic health and well being.

TRANSACTION (SALES) & USE TAX
REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE L

This proposed tax is unfair at a time when they are giving more local taxes
to the state, and saying “LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE AGAIN STEPPING
UP TO HELP THE STATE IN ITS TIME OF NEED.”

While citing the problem of local taxes going to the state, they fail to
acknowledge that they and the cities, through their state associations, have
agreed to give the state even more local taxes for the next two years, in
exchange for a promised ballot measure drafted by Sacramento that may
or may not pass.

They fail to acknowledge their current redevelopment actions and
expenditures which will add to the $18 million already diverted from their
general fund and the $ 2 million diverted from the library.

They cite a Eureka Finance Advisory Committee’s recommendation, but not
the Committee’s companion recommendations that the city collect the $6
million that redevelopment owes the general fund, and that they drop the
tax on utilities.

They fail to mention that 40 PERCENT (TOTALING SOME $5 MILLION)

WILL GO TO THE CITIES. This is far beyond any city needs.

•	Trinidad just increased its sales tax.

•	Eureka and Areata just extended their utility taxes.

•	Eureka has $6 million and Fortuna $13 million that they can collect
from their Redevelopment Agencies.

WHAT TAX WAS EVER “REALLY” TEMPORARY?

IT IS GUARANTEED THAT THE STATE WILL TAKE MORE LOCAL TAXES.
WHY SHOULD WE VOTE FOR MORE TAXES WHEN THEY GIVE THEM
TO THE STATE?

Vote NO on Measure L. <rebutfavorend>

ARGUMENT AGAINST OF MEASURE L

($13 million annually, 60 percent county, 40 percent cities) is
disproportionate to the needs of the individual entities, and would
be detrimental to our already fragile economy.

The city of Trinidad recently increased their sales tax by one percent.
Eureka and Areata recently re-authorized utility taxes. Fortuna is in
the black and has given all employees a 5% salary increases and
hired 5 new employees.

Eureka’s Redevelopment Agency (RDA) owes $6 million to the city’s
general fund, and Fortuna’s RDA owes $13.5 million to the city. With
$18 million already diverted from the county’s general fund to
redevelopment, the County is actively pursuing further diversions
its general fund to redevelopment.

All have recently authorized huge retirement benefits for their
employees, adding several million dollars to taxpayers costs.

The county has failed to act on the $800,000 in management perks
identified by the Humboldt Taxpayer’s League and County Grand Jury.

The Sunset and Poison Pill clauses are ineffectual window dressing.

Local governments, through the League of California Cities and
California State Association of Counties, have already agreed to
give the state an additional $2.6 billion over the next two years.

Their web site says, "Local governments are again stepping up
to help in the state’s hour of need."

With one hand they ask for more taxes - with the other they are
giving it to the state.

That, we believe, says it all - as they come hat in hand for new taxes.

The Humboldt Taxpayer's League urges your NO VOTE on this
disproportionate and unfair tax. <againstend>

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE L

The State, without our permission, has continued to take and spend the
County’s money with reckless abandon. Now, to recover our balance, and
keep the community safe, we respectfully ask for your help.

Measure L is a temporary, LOCAL tax for LOCAL people. The state CANNOT
take it and it will end in four years.

Humboldt County Supervisors have NEVER agreed to bail out the State,
as the Taxpayer’s League wrongly declares.

Before turning to the community for help, county officials studied all options,
made hard decisions, and trimmed every reasonable expense. We face
another $7 million budget gap next year, but there is no sensible place to
make further cuts. This temporary tax is a last-ditch effort to fill the gap.
Measure L is fair. Fair to citizens who cherish our quality of life. Fair to
children, fair to seniors, fair to every family who wants a safe community.
Voting YES on Measure L will protect crucial services. Without it, police and
sheriff patrols will be cut. Crimes will not be investigated. Criminals will not
be fully prosecuted. Libraries, roads, animal control, parks and recreation
will be jeopardized and possibly eliminated.

These drastic cuts will devastate our community - socially AND economically.
We urge you to support Measure L. We can’t force the State to behave;
we must defend our social and economic health the best way we can. A
new tax is not a pleasant option, but it is truly our last resort.

Vote YES on Measure L. <rebutagainstend>
