Compiled by County of Sacramento Voter Registration and Elections

Shall the American River Fire Protection District assess a Special Tax beginning
January 1, 2001, not to exceed $100 per year per parcel, to replace its existing
Rancho Murieta/Sloughhouse Fire Suppression Assessment Fee, to assist in
funding the current level of fire suppression, fire prevention and'emergency
medical services operations?

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE K
Prepared by County Counsel

if approved by the voters, Measure K would allow generation of revenue to
support fire suppression and emergency ambulance services to the Rancho
Murieta/Sloughhouse area. This assessment would replace a voter-approved.
Fire Suppression Assessment Fee which is currently set to expire at the close of
December, 2000.	-

If Measure K is passed, the assessment would be levied annually at a rate not to
exceed $100 per parcel, commencing January 1,2001.

For passage, Measure K requires approval by two-thirds of the voters voting
thereon.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE K

" The American River Fire District proposes to continue the existing level of fire
suppression, fire prevention, and emergency medical service operations in the
i!; Rancho Murieta-Sloughhouse community with a special fire tax to replace the
fire suppression assessment fee that expires December 31, 2000. Property
i taxes from, the community provide about 40% of the cost for delivery of fire
| protection services in the Rancho Murieta-Sloughhouse community and the fire
: suppression assessment fee provides about 10% of that cost. Quality fire
i protection service is being delivered at 50% of cost!

■ it would be very difficult for the American River Fire District to continue the
existing level of protection services without the funding provided by the fire
suppression assessment fee. Unfortunately, recent changes in state law make it
. too expensive for voters to renew this fee. Therefore, the American River Fire
' District proposes Measure K, a special fire tax to replace the fire suppression
assessment fee and-allow continuation of the existing level of fire suppression,
V fire prevention, and emergency medical service operations in the Rancho
I Murieta-Sloughhouse community.	>.

| Without a Yes vote, the District may be unable to continue funding your existing
I, level of protection services. Safeguard your family, your property and yourself,
y Vote to continue quality fire protection services. Vote Yes on Measure K!
