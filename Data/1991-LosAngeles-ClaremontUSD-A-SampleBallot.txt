ANALYSIS OF PROPOSITION A

By DeWitt W. Clinton, County Counsel

Approval of this ballot measure would allow the Claremont Unified School
District to impose a special tax upon each parcel of real property located wholly
or partially within the District, effective July 1, 1992.

The amount of the tax would initially be $97 per year, adjusted annually each
year thereafter in accordance with the Consumer Price Index for the Los Ange-
ies-Anaheim-Riverside area. The tax would be levied each year for a maxi-
mum of 8 years.

Taxpayers who own and occupy contiguous parcels used for single family resi-
dential purposes may, upon application to the Board of Education, have such
parcels treated as a single parcel for purposes of the special tax.

The special tax would be used to reduce class size, address the needs of students
who are at risk of failing, maintain and enhance remedial reading programs,
improve classroom resources and implement up-to-date science programs.

The approval of the measure would also allow the District to increase the legal
ceiling on expenditures currently imposed by the Stale Constitution, in an
amount equal to the tax collected each year. This increase in the ceiling is lim-
ited to four (4) years, without additional voter approval.

A two-thirds (2/3) vote is required for passage of the measure.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION A

Aren’t today’s kids worth to us what we were worth to our parents?

Claremont has always prided itself on its schools. Homes are routinely adver-
tised and priced on the basis of excellent schools. Unfortunately, our school
district is finding it almost impossible to maintain this high quality of educa-
tion. Why?

Beginning in the late I970’s, Claremont, like other California communities,
lost much of its local control over its schools to the State. Eighteen years ago,
when communities had control over their schools, California ranked 12th in
the nation in the percent of personal income its citizens were willing to spend
on education. That standing has now plummeted to 48th.

Today California is near last in the nation in the significant areas of class size
and per-pupil spending. In November 1988, California voters passed Proposi-
tion 98, guaranteeing a base level of funding for schools. Although it has been
said that Proposition 98 was “saved’’ during the recent budget decisions, the
fact is that Claremont schools are expected to receive the equivalent of 12%
less funding from the State in 1991-1992 than just 2 years ago. This means
cuts in programs and classroom personnel.

Claremont should not be at the mercy of unreliable and inadequate State fund-
ing for basic educational resources, such as up-to-date science and remedial
reading programs, needed library books and some class size reductions. The
passage of Proposition A will help maintain the quality of Claremont
education.

Wc believe today’s kids are worth to us what we were worth to our parents.
Our future depends on the strength of their education.

Help regain local control of our schools and our future. Vote YES ON PROPO-
SITION A.
