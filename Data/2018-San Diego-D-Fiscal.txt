MINUTE ORDER NO. 23

SUBJECT:	CERTIFICATION	OF	INITIATIVE	PETITION	REGARDING

COUNTY SERVICE AREA 113 SPECIAL BENEFIT TAX
(DISTRICTS: ALL)

OVERVIEW

The “Initiative Measure Repealing Ordinance No. 6735 Regarding Special Benefit Tax
for Structural Fire Protection in County Service Area 113” was filed with the Registrar
of Voters on May 8, 2017.

The Registrar examined the petition in accordance with California Elections Code, and
found it contains a sufficient number of valid signatures, and is now certifying the
results to the Board of Supervisors. The Board of Supervisors is required to exercise one
of the following options in accordance with State law: 1) to adopt the ordinance to
repeal Ordinance No. 6735 or, 2) to submit the measure to the voters at the June 5, 2018
election.

The County collects the Special Benefit Tax and uses the funds to directly support the
residents who pay the tax. The taxes are used to provide services and capital projects at
the San Pasqual Fire Station. Repeal of the tax could limit the County’s ability to invest
in fire protection equipment and facilities in the San Pasqual area.
