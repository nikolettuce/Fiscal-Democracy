AMENDING TRANSIENT TAX RATE

The following analysis of the ballot measure for the primary election for
the City of Oakdale on November 3, 1992, has been prepared by the City
Attorney's office:

Measure "E”: Shall an ordinance amending Section 11-14 of the Code of
the City of Oakdale, providing that "for the privilege and occupancy in any
hotel, each transient is subject and shall pay a tax in the amount of 10% of
the rent charged by the operator”, be adopted? If Measure *E" passes, the
transient occupancy tax rate as set forth in Section 11-14 of the Oakdale
City Code would be increased from 7% to 10%.
