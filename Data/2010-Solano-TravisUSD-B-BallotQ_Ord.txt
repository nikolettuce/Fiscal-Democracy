FULL TEXT OF MEASURE B

The Governing Board (“Board”) of the Travis Unified School
District (“District”) has established the goals of improving academic
performance and the quality of education for all children in the
District.

In support of these goals and to improve local control of its
programs and services, the Board has proposed supplemental
educational funding for schools and programs for kindergarten
through twelfth grade, including the funds needed to help minimize
class size increases and protect, preserve and improve classroom
and library programs.

The community recognizes the positive impact of excellent
schools on the quality of life in the District, and that successful
schools support and enhance property values.

The District seeks to maintain excellent schools at a time
when the California Legislature is again unable to provide adequate
funding for the operation of the schools in the District.

The District was forced to cut approximately $3.3 million from its
budget in 2009 10, and is again facing budget cuts of approximately
$1 million in 2010 11 due to continuing cuts and unpredictability in
State funding of education for the foreseeable future.

The District may be forced to adopt a budget that includes
teacher and staff layoffs and reductions in programs and services
beneficial and necessary to students.

Property values within the District will be adversely affected by
a decline in the quality of education provided by the District.

A superior and comprehensive education program delivers
many benefits to all the residents of our community.

TERMS

To minimize the loss of teaching positions, increases in class
sizes, cuts in reading, math and other programs and to provide
students with high-quality classroom programs and student services,
shall the Travis Unified School District be authorized beginning July
1, 2011 to levy a qualified special tax of $250 per year for 3 years
with exemptions for seniors and all expenditures reviewed by a
citizens’ oversight committee?

Moneys raised under this Measure shall be authorized to be
used only for the following purposes in accordance with priorities
established by the Board and to the extent of available funds:

•	to minimize increases in class size

•	to hire, train and retain teachers

•	to provide students with the support and instruction they
need to succeed with basic reading and math skills

•	to maintain quality band and music programs

•	to maintain quality physical education programs

•	to provide students and teachers with textbooks and
classroom supplies

•	to provide students at all grade levels with high quality
classroom programs and student services.

Amount and Basis of Tax

The parcel tax shall be $250 per Parcel of Taxable Real
Property beginning in fiscal year 2011 -2012 for a period of three (3)
years. The District shall provide the Solano County Tax Collector
a report indicating the parcel number and amount of tax for each
Parcel of Taxable Real Property.

“Parcel of Taxable Real Property” is defined as any unit of
real property in the District that receives a separate tax bill for ad
valorem property taxes from the County Treasurer-Tax Collector’s
Office. All property that is otherwise exempt from or upon which
no ad valorem property taxes are levied in any year shall also be
exempt from the special tax in such year.

An exemption may be granted on any parcel owned by one or
more persons aged 65 years or older who occupies said parcel as
a principal residence, upon approved application to the District for
exemption.

Claims / Exemption Procedures

With respect to all general property tax matters within its
jurisdiction, the Solano County Tax Assessor or other appropriate
County tax official shall make all final determinations of tax
exemption or relief for any reason, and that decision shall be final
and binding. With respect to matters specific to the levy of the
education parcel tax, including the Senior Citizen Exemption, the
decisions of the District shall be final and binding. The procedures
described herein, and any additional procedures established by
the Board shall be the exclusive claims procedure for claimants
seeking an exemption, refund, reduction, or re-computation of
the special tax by the District. Whether any particular claim is to
be resolved by the District or by the County shall be determined
by the District, in coordination with the County as necessary.
Taxpayers wishing to challenge any determination of the County
Tax Assessor must do so under the procedures for correcting a
misclassification of property pursuant to Part 9 of Division 1 of
the California Revenue and Taxation Code or other applicable
procedures. Taxpayers seeking a refund of any tax paid shall
follow the procedures applicable to property tax refunds pursuant
to the California Revenue and Taxation Code.

Appropriations Limit

Pursuant to California Constitution article XIIIB and applicable
laws, the appropriations limit for the District will be adjusted
periodically by the aggregate sum collected by levy of this special
tax.

Accountability Provisions

Independent Citizens’ Oversight Committee. The Board
shall provide for an independent Citizens’ Oversight Committee to
ensure that moneys raised under this Measure are spent only for
the purposes named in this Measure. The Board shall provide by
resolution for the composition, duties, funding and other necessary
information regarding the Committee’s formation and operation.

Annual Audit. Upon the levy and collection of the education
parcel tax, the Board shall cause an account to be established for
deposit of the proceeds, pursuant to Government Code Section
50075.1. For so long as the tax is in effect, the Superintendent
or the chief financial officer of the District shall cause a report to
be filed with the Board no later than December 31 of each year,
commencing December 31, 2011, stating (1) the amount collected
and expended in such year, and (2) the status of any projects or
description of any programs funded. The report may relate to the
calendar year, fiscal year, or other appropriate annual period, as
said officer shall determine, and may be incorporated into or filed
with the annual budget, audit, or other appropriate routine report to
the Board.

Specific Purposes. All of the purposes named in the measure
shall constitute the specific purposes of the education parcel tax,
and proceeds thereof shall be applied only for such purposes.

Severability

The Board hereby declares, and the voters by approving
this measure concur, that every section and part of this measure
has independent value, and the Board and the voters would have
adopted each provision hereof regardless of every other provision
hereof. Upon approval of this measure by the voters, should any part
of the measure or taxing formula be found by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid for any reason, all remaining parts of the
measure or taxing formula hereof shall remain in full force and effect
to the fullest extent allowed by law.
