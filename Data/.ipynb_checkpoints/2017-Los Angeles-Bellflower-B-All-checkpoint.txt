CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE B

Measure B is a proposition placed on the ballot by the Bellflower City Council. If
approved by voters, Measure B would impose a new general tax upon cannabis
businesses operating within the City of Bellflower including commercial
cultivation, distribution, manufacturing, and retail sales. All tax revenue derived
from the tax would be deposited in the City’s General Fund.

Measure B itself does not authorize or permit cannabis business activities.
Rather, beginning July 1, 2017, it authorizes imposition of an annual tax upon all
commercial cannabis activities authorized by separate City Council action and
state law.

For commercial cannabis cultivation (except for nurseries) the tax would be
$15.00 per fiscal year, per square foot of authorized space. Commencing
July 1, 2020, this tax will increase each fiscal year by $2.50 per square foot until it
reaches a maximum annual tax rate of $25.00 per square foot. For nurseries, the
tax would be $2.00 per square foot of authorized space. Beginning July 1, 2020,
this tax will increase each fiscal year by $1.50 per square foot until it reaches a
maximum annual tax rate of $5.00 per square foot.

Every person transporting cannabis or cannabis products from one permitted
business location of one permittee to another must pay an annual tax of
$1,500.00 per year.

Every person who operates a dispensary, manufacturing facility, testing
laboratory, or distribution facility, or engages in delivery of cannabis in the City
must pay an initial annual tax of 5% of the gross receipts per fiscal year. That
rate would increase on July 1, 2020 (and for each fiscal year thereafter) by 2.5%
until it reaches an annual maximum tax rate of 10%.

Beginning July 1, 2024, and continuing each July 1st thereafter, non-gross receipt
based cannabis taxes (cultivation, nurseries, and transportation) would increase
based upon the consumer price index.

There is no sunset clause on the taxes. All the taxes implemented by Measure B
may be suspended or reduced by City Council action. Any other increase of the
tax would require voter approval.

Measure B would impose a “general tax.” Therefore, all tax revenue would be
available for use by the City to pay for general City operations and services. The
City would not be legally bound in any way to use the tax monies for any special
purpose or for any particular facilities or programs. Since this ballot measure
proposes a “general tax” rather than a “special tax,” it requires approval by a
simple majority of the City’s voters.

A “yes” vote on Measure B favors the Measure. A “no” vote on Measure B
opposes the Measure.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE B

A YES vote on Measure B will make Bellflower a fiscally sound City at no cost to
the residents of Bellflower. The anticipated revenues from Measure B will
provide funding for needed law enforcement, including additional neighborhood
patrols, parks and recreation and after-school programs. The estimated new
funds of up to $3 million annually would allow the City to continue providing the
existing law enforcement and economic development services provided by the
existing utility user tax fees that are set to expire in April 2018. All programs
funded by Measure B will be subject to citizen oversight and review, and the
funds will be fully audited every year.

Measure B will be implemented through a tightly regulated Conditional Use
Permit (CUP) process and regulatory ordinance. It is the City’s intent to allow
only a very limited number of highly qualified operators to do business in the
City. We recognize that cultivation and distribution of cannabis is not necessarily
a preferred activity among all facets of the community. However, it is simply a
matter of good government to regulate and tax a lucrative business that that has
been overwhelmingly approved by voters throughout the State and in the City on
November 8, 2016.

Vote YES on Measure B. It is a matter of good government and good business.

ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE B

Argument Against 12 Pot Businesses in Bellflower & their taxation
Please VOTE NO, against the sale of pot in our city!

This measure doesn’t allow enough distance away from schools, safe passages to
& from school, homes where children live, & churches from these 12 pot
businesses that could harm the brain development of kids with an increased drug
supply & drug culture.

Where is the urgency on the part of the city manager, Mayor, & City Council for
more regular businesses among the vacant lots & buildings throughout
Bellflower? The City will open its doors wide open for up to 12 pot businesses in
your neighborhood? Why has the city given up on our family oriented community
& our kids’ brain development? (google the research)

Maybe a few pot businesses, but 12?

Is the city withholding accurate information about the true nature of the city’s
finances?

Why wasn’t a community task force set up to research the best practices on such
an important issue to develop our community standards on this issue with forums
at local schools & parks?

Federal law is against this, plus a new President might enforce all drug laws. His
proposed Attorney General is against Pot Businesses. Especially if Marijuana
sold in Bellflower will be sold in another state, like what is happening in
Colorado. We should take a wait & see approach to this, like surrounding
bedroom communities. We do not have large industrial areas to hide pot
businesses, like Long Beach.

With the city’s new direction will our property values drop? What will be the
total liability & cost to the city & its residents with higher emergency room visits
with kids experimenting at a higher levels. VOTE NO, SAY NO TO POT &
TAXES!

§ 3.37.070

§ 3.37.080

A.

B.

AUTOMATIC TAX INCREASE.

Beginning on July 1, 2024, non-gross receipts based taxes imposed by
this chapter will be increased annually each July 1st on a percentage basis
using the percentage increase in the consumer price index (“CPI”) for all
urban consumers as calculated by the United States Department of Labor,
Bureau of Labor Statistics, for the Los Angeles-Riverside-Orange County
area, for the 12 months ending March 31st of each year.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this code, the tax imposed in this
chapter will be increased by a minimum of one cent ($0.01) every year for
square footage-based or other non-gross receipts based taxes.

REPORTING AND REMITTANCE OF TAX.

Each person required by this chapter to remit a tax must file a return to the
administrator on forms approved by the administrator on or before the due
date. The full amount of the tax owed must be included with the return and
filed with the administrator. The administrator is authorized to require such
additional information as deemed necessary to determine if the tax is
being levied, collected, and remitted in accordance with this chapter.
Pursuant to Revenue and Tax Code § 7284.6, the administrator, and its
agents, must maintain such filing returns as confidential information, and
not subject to the California Public Records Act.

The Cannabis tax imposed by this chapter is imposed on a fiscal year
basis and is due and payable in quarterly installments as follows:

1.	Each person or business owing a Cannabis tax must, on or before
the last day of the month following the close of each fiscal year
quarter remit to the administrator the tax due. The tax due is no
less than the quarterly installment due, but the taxpayer may at any
time pay the tax due for the entire fiscal year.

2.	If the Cannabis tax is owed on commercial cannabis cultivation, the
square footage tax due is paid based on the square footage of
cultivation authorized by the City permit. The tax will not be
prorated or adjusted for any reduction in the square footage
authorized but not utilized for cultivation unless duly authorized in
writing by the administrator. If the cultivation begins in the middle of
a fiscal year, the administrator must prorate, in daily increments,
the amount due for the fiscal year.

Tax statements and payments for all outstanding taxes owed the City are
immediately due to the administrator upon cessation of business for any
reason.

D.	The administrator may establish shorter reporting and payment periods for
	any taxpayer as the administrator deems necessary to ensure collection of the tax.
E.	The administrator may, as part of administering the tax, modify the form of payment and take such other administrative actions as needed to facilitate collection of the tax.
§ 3.37.090	CONSTITUTIONAL EXEMPTIONS.
A.	The tax imposed by this chapter does not apply to:  1.	Any person or service when imposition of the tax upon that person or service would violate a federal or state statute, the Constitution of the United States, or the Constitution of the state of California;  2.	The city.
B.	Except as otherwise provided, any person that is exempt from the tax imposed by this chapter must file an application with the administrator for an exemption. The application for a Tax exemption must be made upon a form approved by the administrator and state those facts, declared under penalty of perjury, which qualify the applicant for an exemption, and include the names of all utility service providers serving that person. If deemed exempt by the administrator, such person must give the administrator timely written notice of any change in utility service providers so that the administrator can properly notify the new utility service provider of the person's Tax exempt status.
C.	A person failing to comply with this section is not entitled to a refund of Tax remitted to the administrator from such person as a result of such non-compliance.

§ 3.37.100 SUSPENSION OR REDUCTION.

Nothing in this chapter requires the City Council to collect a tax; the city council
may suspend or reduce tax rates imposed by this chapter by resolution after a
public hearing.

§ 3.37.110 CITY COUNCIL AUTHORITY TO AMEND.

Unless voter is approval is required by the California Constitution or applicable
law, the City Council may exercise all applicable powers set forth in the
Government Code including, without limitation, amending this chapter by
ordinance upon three affirmative votes by its members. It may, in additional,
adopt by ordinance or resolution such additional regulations that may be
necessary to implement the purposes of this chapter.”

SECTION 2. Environmental Analysis. This Resolution is exempt from review
under the California Environmental Quality Act (California Public Resources Code §§
2100, et	seq., “CEQA”)	and CEQA regulations (14 California Code of Regulations §§

15000, et seq.) because it establishes rules and procedures to implement government
funding mechanisms; does not involve any commitment to a specific project which could
result in a potentially significant physical impact on the environment; and constitutes an
organizational or administrative activity that will not result in direct or indirect physical
changes in the environment. Accordingly, this Resolution does not constitute a “project”
that requires environmental review (see specifically 14 CCR § 15378(b)(4-5)).

SECTION 3. Interpretation. This Proposition must be interpreted so as to be
consistent with all federal and state laws, rules, and regulations. If any section, sub-
section, sentence, clause, phrase, part, or portion of this Proposition is held to be invalid
or unconstitutional by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, such decision
does not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this Proposition. The voters
declare that this Proposition, and each section, sub-section, sentence, clause, phrase,
part, or portion thereof, would have been adopted or passed irrespective of the fact that
any one or more sections, sub-sections, sentences, clauses, phrases, part, or portion is
found to be invalid. If any provision of this Proposition is held invalid as applied to any
person or circumstance, such invalidity does not affect any application of this
Proposition that can be given effect without the invalid application.

SECTION 4. Severability. If any portion of this Proposition is held by a court
of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the remainder of the Proposition and the
application of such provision to other persons or circumstances will not be affected
thereby. We the People indicate our strong desire that: (i) the City Council use its best
efforts to sustain and reenact that portion, and (ii) the City Council implement this
Proposition by taking all steps possible to cure any inadequacies or deficiencies
identified by the court in a manner consistent with the express and implied intent of this
Proposition, and then adopting or reenacting such portion as necessary or desirable to
allow imposition of the tax.

SECTION 5. Construction. This Proposition must be broadly construed in
order to achieve the purposes stated in this Proposition. It is the intent of the voters that
the provisions of this Proposition be interpreted or implemented by the City and others
in a manner that facilitates the purposes set forth in this Proposition.

SECTION 6. Effective Date. This Proposition will enact and impose a general
tax. Accordingly, it will be submitted to a general election on March 7, 2017 for voter
approval. If a majority of voters vote in favor of this Proposition, it will become valid and
binding ten days after the date that the City Council certifies the election results in
accordance with Elections Code § 9217.

Ordinance No. 1324
Page 6 of 6

SECTION 7. City Council Authority. BMC Chapter 3.37 may be repealed or
amended by a majority of the City Council without voter approval. However, voter
approval is required for any amendment that would increase the rate of any tax levied
pursuant to this Proposition as required by California Constitution Article XI11C. Should
the provisions of Government Code § 53720, et seq. or California Constitution Article
XIIIC be repealed or amended, or interpreted by the courts so that voter approval is not
required for enacting this Proposition, then this Proposition will take effect as provided
for all other City ordinances and may be amended in the same manner as all other City
ordinances.

SECTION 8. Effective Date. The Mayor will sign this Proposition and the City
Clerk will attest and certify to the passage and adoption of this Ordinance if a majority of
the voters voting in the City’s general election on March 7, 2017 approve the
Proposition.

I HEREBY CERTIFY MEASURE B (ORDINANCE NO. 1324) WAS PASSED,
