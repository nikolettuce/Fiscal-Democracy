WHEREAS, the City of Daly City has been facing ongoing fiscal challenges dating to the
“great recession” of 2008/2009, resulting in reductions to staffing levels across all city
departments and operations, except for sworn personnel in Fire and Police; and

WHEREAS, salaries and benefits have been reduced for current staff, significant
reductions have been made in direct services to the public and to departmental operations; and

WHEREAS, increasing workforce costs, rising healthcare expenses, overtime costs due
to staffing shortages, and escalating pension obligations due to losses suffered by the CalPERS,
have all contributed to a perfect storm when coupled with a sluggish economic recovery
affecting the City’s revenues; and

WHEREAS, stagnant revenue growth over the last serval years, as well as the lack of a
diversified revenue base and overxeliance on property, sales, and utility users taxes, have
contributed to a structural budget deficit of approximately $6 million; and ;

WHEREAS, to address the structural budget deficit and minimize reliance on general
fund reserves to plug the fiscal gap, in the just adopted FY 2016-17 and 2017-18 biennial budget,
the City Council approved recommended cuts in service levels and programs across every city
department including, for the first time, significant reductions in public safety services including
the elimination of six vacant police officer positions in the Police Department and the
elimination of a Fire Department engine company (nine sworn fire personnel); and

WHEREAS, these budget reductions, while not desired by the City, were necessary to
support balancing the FY 2016-17 and 2017-18 budget and avoid continued reliance on the
City’s reserves to support ongoing fiscal expenditures which would have exacerbated the City’s
already growing budget deficit; and

WHEREAS, thereafter the City Council directed staff to examine a new source of
revenue to fund the restoration of the public safety services cut from the current biennial budget;
and

WHEREAS, at its regular meeting of July 25,2016, City staff presented the City Council
with information related to the potential implementation of a parcel tax pursuant to Article 3.7 of
Chapter 4 of Part 1 of Division 2 of Title 5 of the Government Code (Sections 53720-53730) and
the California Constitution Articles xm A, Section 4 and XIH D, Section 3(a)(2), specifically
for police and fire public safety purposes, and after duly considering all information and public
testimony thereon, the City Council directed staff to present it with legislation necessary to place
a Parcel Tax Ordinance on the November 8,2016; and

WHEREAS, the proposed “ORDINANCE ADDING CHAPTER 3.26 TO TITLE 3 \

to be billed on the annual property tax bill sent by the county tax collector pursuant to
Government Code section 53087.4, thereby generating an estimated $3.8 million per year to
restore specific police and fire personnel and related operational costs; and

WHEREAS, a general municipal election consolidated with the statewide general
election to be held on Tuesday, November 8, 2016, has been called and pursuant to Government
