the dwelling unit to be constructed, with a minimum fee of Three Hundred
Dollars ($300) and a maximum fee of One Thousand Two Hundred Dollars
($1,200). The fee will be imposed at the time of issuance of the building permit. The fee will be imposed on new residential dwellings for the next ten
years, Proceeds from the imposition of the fee must be used by the Vallecito
Union School District solely to alleviate conditions of overcrowding.

A “NO” vote on this measure is a vote against the imposition of the fee
described above.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE B

This measure will continue to provide for additional classrooms in the
Vallecito Union School District by requiring a fee for each NEW residential
dwelling unit built. The income from the new construction fee will continue to
provide temporary and permanent facilities for the Vallecito Union School
District. Existing homeowners will not pay any fees or assessments under
this proposition.

The Vallecito Union School District is located in a fast-growing area and
continues to experience a growth rate of 6 to 10% per year. At the present
time, both schools in the district have exceeded their designed capacity. To
continue to enroll students without adequate space hurts all students.

The new construction fee continues to be the best solution NOW for dealing with the overcrowded condition.

Your YETI vote will continue to provide funds for additional school district
facilities. Help us to continue to maintain a quality program for the students
of the district!
