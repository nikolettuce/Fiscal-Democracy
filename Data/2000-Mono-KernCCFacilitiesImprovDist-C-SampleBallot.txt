IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL
MEASURE C

Mammoth Campus, Kern Community College District Bonds

Ad valorem property taxes (taxes based on the assessed value of property) ordinarily cannot be levied above 1% of the full cash value of
the property. Under an exception added to the California Constitution in 1986, however, ad valorem property taxes above the 1% limitation
may be imposed if approved by 2/3 of the votes cast on the election proposal. Under the exception, the taxes must be used to pay for debt
service on bonded indebtedness for the acquisition or improvement of real property.

If there is a 2/3 vote in favor of Measure C, the Mammoth Campus, Kern Community College School Facilities Improvement District (the
“Improvement District'1) will be authorized to incur bonded indebtedness for the following stated purposes:

1.	To expand and improve the Mammoth Campus of Cerro Coso College.

2.	To build additional classrooms and labs.

3.	To build an astronomy center.

4.	To build a new library and an arts center.

Measure C would authorize the Improvement District to cause to be levied an annual ad valorem property tax on property located within
the Improvement District boundaries to pay for the debt service on the Bonds. The boundaries of the Improvement District are the same as
the boundaries of the Town of Mammoth Lakes, excluding the airport.

The maximum amount of the proposed bonded indebtedness is $15 million and the maximum duration of the Bonds is 25 years. The exact
effect on tax rates of the issue and sale of the Bonds cannot be determined until the Bonds have been sold. Estimated information regarding
tax rates is available in the Tax Rate Statement, which is provided in this pamphlet.

If the measure is not approved by at least 2/3 of the qualified electors voting on the measure, the measure will fail and no bonds will be issued.

A "yes" vote is a vote to authorize the Mammoth Campus, Kern Community College School Facilities Improvement District to issue and sell
the Bonds and to levy taxes to pay for the debt service on the Bonds.

A "no" vote is a vote against authorizing the Mammoth Campus, Kern Community College School Facilities Improvement District to issue
and sell the Bonds.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure C submitted by the Office of the Mono County Counsel pursuant to
the requirements of Section 9500 et seq. of the California Elections Code. If you would like a copy of the measure, please call
the elections official’s office at (760) 932-5215 and a copy will be mailed to you at no cost.

TAX RATE STATEMENT
IN CONNECTION WITH MAMMOTH CAMPUS,

CERRO COSO COLLEGE,

SCHOOL FACILITIES IMPROVEMENT DISTRICT

An election will be held in the Mammoth Campus of the Cerro Coso
College, School Facilities Improvement District on, September 26,
2000 to authorize the sale of up to $15 million in general obligation
bonds of the District to finance the acquisition and improvement of
real property. If such bonds are authorized and sold, the principal
thereof and interest thereon will be payable from the proceeds of tax
levies made upon the taxable property in the District. The following
information is provided in compliance with Sections 9400-9404 of the
Election Code of the State of California.

1.	The best estimate of the tax rate that would be required to
be levied to fund the bond issue during the first fiscal year
after the first sale of bonds based on a projection of future
assessed valuations is $0,028 per $100 of assessed valuation
in Fiscal Year 2001-2002.

2.	The best estimate of the tax rate that would be required to
be levied to fund the bond issue during the first fiscal year
after the last sale of bonds if the bonds are sold in series,
and an estimate of the fiscal year in which that rate will apply,
based on a projection of future assessed valuations is $0,028
per $100 of assessed valuation in Fiscal Year 2011-12.

3.	The best estimate of the highest tax rate that would be required
to be levied to fund the bond issue and an estimate of the
fiscal year in which that rate will apply, based on a projection
of future assessed valuations, is again $0,028 per $100 of
assessed valuation, which is projected to be the same in every
fiscal year.

Attention of all voters is directed to the fact that the foregoing is
based upon projections and estimates only, which are not binding
upon the District. The actual tax rates and years in which they will
apply may vary (rom those presently estimated, due to variations
from these estimates in the timing of bond sales, the amount of bonds
sold at any given sale, and the actual assessed valuation over the
term of the repayment of the bonds. The actual time of sales of said
bonds and the amount sold at any given time will be governed by
the needs of the District and other factors (including market rate
variations in the interest rate on general obligation bonds). Actual
future assessed valuation will depend upon the amount and value of
taxable property within the District as determined in the assessment
and equalization process.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE C

The Mammoth Campus of the Cerro Coso College is an asset to
our community. The College provides affordable academic, cultural and
business development opportunities to all of our residents. It allows
for adults and our high school students to continue their education
locally in Mammoth. Enrollment continues to grow annually and is
expected to exceed 500 by 2001.

The Mammoth Campus has secured $7 million in State funding for
construction and needed expansion. The Mammoth Lakes Foundation
has contributed $5 million over the past ten years, including the land
and funding for the first phase of the College’s construction. Having
fully utilized all other resources, the College must now locally fund
the remaining share to complete the required projects. Consequently,
Measure C has been placed on the September 26h ballot.

The College must be expanded to best serve the academic and cultural
needs of our community and provide a wider choice of courses and trades
to better equip our residents to face the challenges of the 21s Century.

MEASURE C WILL:

•	IMPROVE AND EXPAND THE COLLEGE CAMPUS

•	CONSTRUCT ADDITIONAL PERMANENT CLASSROOMS
AND A COMPUTER LAB

•	CREATE A NEW SCIENCE LAB AND ASTRONOMY CENTER

•	BUILD A NEW COLLEGE LIBRARY AND CONSTRUCT A
FINE ARTS CENTER FOR COMMUNITY USE

All Measure C proceeds will be used locally to benefit the residents
of Mammoth Lakes. Under State Law, no funds from Measure C can
be used for salaries or operating expenses.

Living in Mammoth should not mean foregoing cultural opportunities,
higher education and 21s Century business skills. Voting Yes on Measure
C will have lasting, positive benefits. It will provide affordable
opportunities to better educate our children, ourselves and our
community without having to leave the area. Join us in voting YES on
Measure C. It's an investment in ourselves.
