IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY	ANALISIS IMPARCIAL POR EL PROCURADOR MUNICIPAL
CITYOFTEHACHAPI MEASURE F	CIUDAD DE TEHACHAPI MEDIDA F
This ballot measure asks the voters of the City of Tehachapi to approve a transac- tions and use tax ordinance (the “sales tax ordinance”) that would increase the City’s existing sales tax rate by 0.50% or one-half cent for every dollar of taxable sales of goods in the City, and on the taxable storage, use or consumption in the City of goods purchased. The total sales tax rate currently paid in the City of Tehachapi, which also includes the sales tax rate collected for the State of Califor- nia and the County of Kern, is 7.50%. If this measure is approved by the voters, the total sales tax rate in the City will increase to 8.00%.  The proposed tax is a general tax. The tax revenues will be deposited in the City’s general fund and may be used for any municipal purpose. It is estimated by the City Manager that this measure will raise approximately $1.3 million per year in general fund revenue for the City beginning in the 2015-16 fiscal year.  The tax is subject to an independent annual financial audit that will review whether the tax is collected, managed and expended in accordance with the requirements of the proposed sales tax ordinance. In addition, the proposed sales tax ordinance requires an annual report to the City Council regarding the amount of revenues collected pursuant to the sales tax ordinance and how the City used such reve- nues. If adopted by the voters, the tax would be in effect for ten years and termi- nate on March 31,2025. On August 4,2014, the City Council approved Resolution No. 57-14 to place this measure on the ballot.  Article XIIIC of the California Constitution, commonly known as Proposition 218, requires that the proposed tax be approved by a majority of the voters voting on the ballot measure. A “yes” vote on the measure enacts the sales tax ordinance. A “no” vote will result in the tax not being adopted.  The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure F. If you desire a copy of the sales tax ordinance, please call the City Clerk at 661 -822-2200, and a copy will be mailed at no cost to you.	Esta medida de la balota les pide a los votantes de la Ciudad de Tehachapi a que aprueben una ordenanza de un impuesto de transacciones y uso (la “ordenanza de impuesto sobre las ventas”) que aumentaria la tasa existente de impuesto sobre las ventas de la Ciudad por 0.50% o medio centavo por cada dolar de ventas imponibles de bienes en la Ciudad, y en el almacenamiento imponible, el uso o el consumo en la Ciudad de los bienes adquiridos. La tasa de impuesto total de ventas que actualmente se paga en la Ciudad de Tehachapi, que tambien incluye la tasa de impuesto sobre las ventas recaudado para el Estado de Califor- nia y el Condado de Kern, es 7.50%. Si esta medida es aprobada por los votantes, la tasa de impuesto total sobre las ventas en la Ciudad aumentara a 8.00%.  El impuesto propuesto es un impuesto general. Los ingresos por impuestos seran depositados en el fondo general de la Ciudad y se pueden usarse para cualquier proposito municipal. Se estima por el Administrador Municipal que esta medida aumentara aproximadamente $1.3 millones por ano en ingresos de fondo general para la Ciudad empezando en el ano fiscal 2015-16.  El impuesto esta sujeto a una auditoria financiera independiente anual que revisara si el impuesto es recaudado, gestionado y agotado de acuerdo con los requisitos de la propuesta ordenanza de impuesto sobre las ventas. Ademas, la propuesta ordenanza de impuesto sobre las ventas requiere un informe anual al Concejo Municipal en cuanto a la cantidad de los ingresos recaudados conforme a la ordenanza de impuesto sobre las ventas y como la Ciudad uso tales ingresos. Si es adoptada por los votantes, el impuesto estaria en vigor por diez anos y terminariael 31 de marzo de 2025. El 4 de agosto de 2014, el Concejo Municipal aprobo la Resolution Num. 57-14 para poner esta medida en la balota.  El Articulo XIIIC de la Constitution de California, comunmente conocida como la Propuesta 218, requiere que el impuesto propuesto sea aprobada por una mayoria de los votantes votando sobre la medida de la balota. Un voto de “si” sobre la medida promulga la ordenanza de impuesto sobre las ventas. Un voto de “no” resultara en que el impuesto no se adopte.  La declaration anterior es un analisis imparcial de la Medida F. Si usted desea una copia de la ordenanza de impuesto sobre las ventas, por favor llamele al Actuario Municipal al 661 -822-2200, y una copia se le enviara por correo sin costo alguno a usted.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE F	ARGUMENTO A FAVOR DE MEDIDA F
On this ballot is a proposed temporary sales tax measure that would generate a supplemental source of revenue for the City that the State cannot take away.  While the City has continued to adopt balanced budgets throughout the recession, the elimination of the Redevelopment Agency (RDA), severely hampered our abil- ity to deliver projects like the downtown enhancements, the BeeKay Theatre, the Historic Depot, and other quality of life improvements.  The City also needs to reinvest in our street network. According to a recent engi- neering study, the roads in the City are reaching a critical turning point where maintenance is no longer effective and costly reconstruction will be needed for many roads. A reasonable program of street repair and maintenance costs over $3 million and current expenditures on street maintenance average approxi- mately half of that annually.  The benefit of the sales tax measure is that the revenue generated can be spent not just on projects and streets, but other City services as well. We believe citizens thinkthat enhancing City streets, continuing beautification throughoutthe City, im- proving senior services, developing better recreation opportunities, and increas- ing other City services is worth investing an additional Vz a penny on a dollar purchase of taxable goods. Voting “yes” on this measure would confirm that belief.  s/Ed Grimes, City Council  s/Donna Fischman, Slick Fish Marketing, Owner	En esta balota hay una medida de un impuesto temporal propuesto sobre las ventas que generarfa una fuente suplementaria de ingresos para la Ciudad que el Estado no puede llevarse.  Mientras que la Ciudad ha seguido adoptando presupuestos cuadrados durante la recesion, la elimination de la Agenda de Reurbanizacion (RDA), obstaculizo gravemente nuestra habilidad de ofrecer proyectos como las mejoras del centro, el Teatro BeeKay, la Estacion Historica, y otros mejoramientos para la calidad de vida.  La Ciudad tambien necesita reinvertir en nuestra red de calles. De acuerdo con un estudio de ingenieria reciente, los caminos de la Ciudad estan llegando a un momento crucial en el que el mantenimiento ya no es efectivo y se necesitara la reconstruction costosa para muchos caminos. Un programa razonable de reparation y mantenimiento de calles cuesta mas de $3 millones y los gastos actuales en el mantenimiento de las calles se promedia aproximadamente la mitad de eso anualmente.  El beneficio de la medida del impuesto sobre las ventas es que los ingresos generados se pueden gastar no solo en los proyectos y en las calles, pero en otros servicios de la Ciudad tambien. Creemos que los ciudadanos piensan que realzando las calles de la Ciudad, continuando el embellecimiento en toda la Ciudad, mejorando los servicios para las personas de la tercera edad, desarrollando mejores oportunidades de recreo, y aumentando otros servicios de la Ciudad vale la pena invertir un Vz centavo adicional en la compra de bienes imponibles con un dolar. Votando “si” sobre esta medida confirmaria esa creencia.
