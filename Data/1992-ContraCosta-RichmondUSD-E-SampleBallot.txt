ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF
RICHMOND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT
SPECIAL TAX MEASURE E ELECTION
TUESDAY, APRIL 14, 1992

Our school district's problems are well documented. The excesses of past administrations have
had a severe and detrimental effect on our local schools and children. The financial crisis has
forced the school district to cut the .sixth period in middle schools and junior high, lay off
employees, postpone essential maintenance of facilities and reduce teacher and employee
salaries by 9'r.

The continuing state financial crisis means further cuts in our educational program and an
increase in class size.

“Measure E, for Education,"1 has been proposed by parents, teachers and community and bus-
iness leaders as an important step to get our schools back on track.

Measure E would allow the district to raise $4 million per year for the next five years.

The money from Measure E could only be spent to-

1.	Restore the sixth period which had been previously cut.

2.	Restore college preparatory and basic education courses for high school students.

3.	Improve English and science instruction for elementary school children.

4.	Restore Vi of the 9ri cut in teacher and employee pay.

No money would be used for administrative overhead or for previous debts. The cost of Measure
B would be $60 per year per parcel —only $5 per month. Measure E would expire in 5 years
and if needed, would have to be approved again by the voters.

Homeowners over 65 would be exempt. All funds generated by Measure E would stay in the
school district to benefit Pinole. Hercules, El Sobranie, San Pablo, Richmond, North Richmond,
El Cerrito, Kensington, and other unincorporated areas of West County.

VOTE YES ON MEASURE E.
