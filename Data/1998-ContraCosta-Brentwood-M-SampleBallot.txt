MEASURE M

Shall the proposed ordinance to protect funding for parks in the City of Brentwood be approved?
YES NO	

CITY ATTORNEY IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
OF MEASURE M

Measure “M” on the ballot provides: “Shall the proposed ordinance to protect funding for parks in the City
of Brentwood be approved?”

The full text of the proposed ordinance follows this Impartial Analysis. The ordinance will not be effective
unless and until approved by a vote of not less than a majority of those voting on this Measure and provided
further that this Measure receives more affirmative votes than Measure “N” which also appears on the ballot.

The ordinance is on the ballot because the City Council requested it to be submitted to the voters.

The ordinance would authorize the City to continue with City-Wide Park Maintenance Assessment District
98-1. In April 1998, Brentwood property owners voted to assess themselves a maximum $79 a year, per
single family dwelling, to maintain park and recreational facilities in Brentwood. Other land uses, such as
multi-family, commercial, public property and agricultural, were also assessed at different amounts. This
City-Wide Park Maintenance Assessment District 98-1 is currently in full force and effect.

The ordinance is directly contrary to Measure “N” which is also on the ballot. Measure “N” seeks to
terminate City-Wide Park Maintenance Assessment District 98-1. This ordinance seeks to confirm the
District. Even if this ordinance and Measure “N” both fail to receive a majority vote, City-Wide Park
Maintenance Assessment District 98-1 would continue in full force and effect.

A 'yes’ vote means you are in favor of Measure “M” and the City’s park maintenance funding program and
a ‘no’ vote means you are opposed to Measure “M” and opposed to the City’s park maintenance funding
program

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF

MEASURE M
TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 3,1998

Measure M provides parks and recreational opportunities for the youth and families of Brentwood. Measure
M ensures these opportunities will be available for all residents on an equal basis. It also means park
maintenance can be provided through private enterprise bids on a scale that can insure the highest quality at
the lowest price. Measure M is accountable to you, the resident, placing a required public hearing before any


annual assessments can be levied. Having attractive and accessible programs of community parks enhance
property values and helps increase the quality of life in Brentwood’s neighborhoods. Many Brentwood youth
will continue to be denied opportunities to swim, play softball, baseball, soccer and other recreational
activities if park facilities are not available. Measure M provides new opportunities for the Brentwood
schools in partnership with the City to share common park and recreational facilities and maintenance making
your tax dollars go farther. The State law that established the Parks Maintenance District required a “worst
case scenario” fee be established. That fee of $79.00 per parcel annually was levied in 1998-99 and will be
used to help implement the maintenance of the park lands that developers must build as required by the City’s
General Plan. The responsibility for managing these funds is spelled out in State law. An annual expenditure
plan must be submitted to the public each year before funds can be spent and requires approval by the City
Council. This is not a program of over spending or big government. Just the opposite, it invites public scrutiny
and private sector performance. Your support for Measure M ensures a fair and equitable Park Maintenance
Program.

MEASURE M
TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 3,1998

It is heartening to see that the city is finally considering a private contractor to maintain the parks, a
suggestion we have been advocating all along.

With a private contractor, there will be no need for a city-wide park tax.

Antioch saved $1 million by using private contractors, which enabled the city to maintain its 190 2 acres of
parks, after voters rejected a similar park tax measure there.

The city is trying to blackmail us by stating that swimming, baseball, soccer and other activities will be
denied to Brentwood youth if we don’t pay more taxes.

If a budget shortage existed, we should be outraged that youth recreation is the program the city chose to cut
But growth in property tax and sales tax revenue has increased Brentwood’s budget for 1998-99. Moreover,
the new state budget contains $130 million for parkland acquisition and another $50 million for low-cost
loans to finance city park projects.

Park maintenance has historically been paid from the city’s general fund and landscaping and lighting
assessments. But by moving park maintenance out of the general fund and adding this new park tax, the city
freed up huge sums for itself to spend elsewhere. We don’t even know where that money is going.

There’s no reason to change the way parks were financed in the past. Don’t agree to keep this new tax

Vote NO on measure M.

ARGUMENT AGAINST
CITY OF BRENTWOOD
MEASURE M
TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 3,1998

Measure 98-129 will do nothing but retain the park tax forced on unwilling Brentwood homeowners by the
city and a few big developers


The $79 tax was passed by a narrow margin of 153 votes. Support for the tax came mainly from nonresident
developers who need the city’s blessing to develop. Their large tracts of land were entitled to huge blocks of
votes, which accounted for over 40 percent of the support for the tax. Without them, the tax would have
failed by a landslide.

Controversy erupted when one city councilman met with the district engineer the last week of the election
with the measure behind in votes, to determine which large landholders had not yet voted so that he could
contact them and “encourage” them to cast their votes.

The tax was not approved by the Brentwood homeowners who ultimately must pay the tax, but by out-of-
town developers whose intent was not to assess themselves, but to win the city’s favor by cooperating with
city’s desire for more revenue

By shifting all park funding over to this new tax, the city has freed up a great deal of money in its general
fund for some unknown unpublicized purpose.

When the city wants more money, why does it always put our highest priority services, like police and parks,
on the chopping block in an attempt to blackmail us into accepting more taxes? We homeowners live on a
budget. We prioritize our spending so that essentials are covered even if it means cutting out some
nonessentials.

Its time to say we want a city council that can live on a budget and prioritize their spending like we do. Parks
can be maintained without the wasteful, overpriced program we have now.

Vote NO.

MEASURE M
TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 1998

The opponents of Measure M have refused to acknowledge the benefits parks bring to a community. They
fail to tell residents the truth about taxes and that total City property taxes paid for 1998-99 are $980,000
or $5.77 per person. This does not even fund one-third of the cost of our Police service. Park maintenance
funds are kept in a separate account and can only be used for park maintenance. Unspent funds are carried
over to reduce the next years assessment, and cannot be used to finance other City services.

The opponents of Measure M are using scare tactics, by saying if you don’t vote for Measure M the City will
cut critical services. NOT TRUE. They suggest if you support Measure M it will produce budget savings for
some unknown City project. NOT TRUE. The City committed itself to continue funding the same $223,000
you pay now for park maintenance, unfortunately this only pays for present park maintenance by the
Recreation and Park District and not any future regional or neighborhood parks.

Measure M opponents say this benefit district was forced upon an unwilling population by big developers.
NOT TRUE

Every property' owner of the 6,025 parcels of land in the City was eligible to vote. Unfortunately just 50%
of all parcels voted. The results were a factor of who voted, not who could have.

The opponents have said they don’t want “wasteful” parks. Their vision is one of crowded neighborhoods
with houses where parks should be.
