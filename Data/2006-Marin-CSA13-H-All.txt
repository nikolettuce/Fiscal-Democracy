SECTION I. Authority, Purpose and Intent. This

COUNTY COUNSEL’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
OF MEASURE H

If this measure is approved by a two-thirds vote, for
County Service Area No. 13, Ordinance No. 3458, increas-
ing the maximum special tax to continue emergency para-
medic services, effective July 1, 2007, in an amount not to

County Counsel

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE H

For over 22 years, County Service Area No. 13 (Upper
Lucas Valley) has contracted with the City of San Rafael for
paramedic services. A YES vote on Measure H will ensure
that all households will continue to receive the protections
and benefits of this vital lifesaving service. The approval of
2/3 of those voting is required to pass this measure.

This measure authorizes continuation of the paramedic
charge and sets the maximum amount at $85.00 per year.
For the last four years the maximum amount was $61.00
which we are currently paying.

In order to account for future cost increases, this measure
provides the authority to increase the maximum amount to
$85.00 over four years.

If this measure does not pass by a 2/3 majority, the City of
San Rafael can terminate paramedic service to our com-
munity.

We urge a “YES” vote to maintain this vital service to our
Lucas Valley Community.
