KENWOOD SCHOOL DISTRICT
MEASURE A

Shall the Kenwood School District, serving the children

A of Kenwood, provide funds for the purpose of reduction
of class size and maintenance and enhancement of
academic and educational programs by levying a
special tax assessment on each assessor’s parcel of $52.00
per year ($26.00 per semi-annual payment) for a period of five
years, beginning July 1,2007, with certain specific exemptions
as set forth in the Resolution and Order of Election?

COUNTY COUNSEL’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF
MEASURE A

The Kenwood School District has called an election on a special tax
measure to fund educational programs. State law requires voter ap-
proval before a school district can impose a special tax.

Currently, the District imposes a special tax of $48 per year per
parcel to fund educational programs. The measure now before the
voters proposes a special tax of $52 per year per parcel for each par-
cel of land within the District’s boundaries. The tax would begin on July
1, 2007, when the District’s existing special tax ends, and would re-
main in effect for no more than five years.

Proceeds of the tax would be placed in a special fund and could only
be used for the purposes set out in the measure, which include
class size reduction, and maintenance and enhancement of aca-
demic and educational programs. State law establishes additional ac-
countability measures which require filing of an annual report by the
chief fiscal officer of the district stating the amount of funds collected
and expended, and the status of any project required or authorized to
be funded by the tax measure.

The tax would be applied to each unit of real property in the District
that receives a separate tax bill for property taxes. Multiple parcels
that are contiguous and are part of one economic unit under the same
name and ownership would be charged as one parcel. Parcels which
are exempt from property tax, or on which no property tax is otherwise
levied, are also exempt from this tax. The'measure also exempts from
the tax parcels owned or partially owned and occupied by a person
who will be 65 years of age or older on or before May 1,2007, or May 1
of any subsequent year for which the tax is assessed. Persons claim-
ing exemptions based on ownership by a senior citizen would need to
apply to the District for this exemption by May 1 the first year it applied
to them. The measure requires the District to establish an administra-
tive review process for such exemption applications.

If two-thirds of the voters in the Kenwood School District who vote on
this measure vote “yes," the measure will pass and the special tax will
be levied. The tax would be collected in the same manner as regular
property taxes starting with the 2007- 2008 fiscal year.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE A

Kenwood Elementary School, with a district including roughly half of
Oakmont, has demonstrated tremendous academic success. These
achievements have been made possible by a parcel tax last approved
by voters in 2001, and due to expire on June 30,2007. A “Yes" vote on
Measure A will maintain your current annual tax of $52 through June,
2012. The same tax exemptions will be offered.

In 2001, 78.3% of our community voted “Yes” in favor of this parcel
tax. Here is why Kenwood School has earned your support.

The school promised and has maintained that the proceeds from the
tax would be spent only on student programs, not on administration,
pay raises or facilities. The top priority will again be to maintain our
small class sizes and fund enrichment programs.

The parcel tax collects approximately $100,000 each year. All funds
have been spent on student programs, including art, music, physical
education and computer technology.

Kenwood School District is a small, basic aid district and therefore
does not qualify for funding that many other California schools are cur-
rently receiving. It is even more important today for this measure to be
successful as the state lottery provides only 1% of our school’s total
annual budget.

Kenwood School has kept its promises, maintains the standards of
excellence and continues to provide the best possible educational
program for the children of our community. Please vote “Yes” to main-
tain this critical funding for our children.

FULL TEXT OF MEASURE A

Shall the Kenwood School District, serving the children of Kenwood,
provide funds for the purpose of reduction of class size and the main-
tenance and enhancement of academic and educational programs
of the Kenwood School District by continuing its current special tax
based upon the use or right of use on each assessor's parcel
within the boundaries of the Kenwood School District for a period
of five (5) years beginning July 1,2007 and increasing its appropria-
tions limit for the maximum time allowed by law by the amount of rev-
enue generated by that special tax?

The special lax will be imposed in the amount of $52.00 per year for each
assessor’s parcel. The proceeds of the tax shall be deposited in a
special fund to be used for the purpose of reduction of class size and
the maintenance and enhancement of academic and educational
programs of the Kenwood School District. Exemptions from the as-
sessment will be made available as follows:

a.	To each individual in the District who will attain 65 years
on or before May 1 of the assessment year, and who
owns a beneficial interest in the parcel, or a divided or un-
divided portion of such parcel, and who uses that parcel
as his or her principal place of residence.

b.	For the owner of a parcel which has been determined to
be unusable by the Sonoma County Assessor’s Office.

c.	For multiple parcels which are contiguous and are part of
one economic unit under the same name and ownership.
Such multiple parcels may be charged as one parcel.

Anyone claiming an exemption must apply to the District on or before
May 1,2007 or May 1 Of any succeeding assessment year.

Any one application from a qualified applicant will provide an exemp-
tion for the parcel for the remaining term of the assessment so long
as such applicant continues to qualify for the exemption. The District
shall establish an administrative review process to grant such ex-
emptions.
