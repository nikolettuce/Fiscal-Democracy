FULL TEXT OF MEASURE E
ROWLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT

To prevent deep cuts in local educational programs, including: maintaining college preparation classes, high school counselors, student
health/safety/security services, adequate instructional supplies and classroom technology; keeping school libraries open; protecting small class sizes and
music/art programs; and retaining qualified teachers; shall Rowland Unified School District levy an annual $120 tax per parcel, for 5 years only, with
independent oversight, an exemption for seniors, no money for administrator salaries, and all funds benefiting Rowland Unified schools?

PARCEL TAX AUTHORIZATION

By approval of this proposition by at least two-thirds (2/3) of the registered voters voting on the proposition, the District will be authorized to levy a qualified
special tax of $120 per parcel, subject to all the accountability requirements specified below.

ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIREMENTS

The provisions in this section are specifically included in this proposition in order that the voters and taxpayers in the District may be assured that their
money will be spent wisely. As required by the laws of the State of California, the proceeds of the qualified special tax will be deposited into a special account
established by the District and will be applied only to the specific purposes identified herein. The District has covenanted to file with its governing board each
year a report stating the amount of the funds collected and expended and the status of any project authorized to be funded.

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL
MEASURE E

Approval of Measure E would authorize the Board of Education (“Board’') of
the Rowland Unified School District (“District") to levy a special parcel tax
('Tax") of $120 per parcel for five (5) years, on each parcel of taxable land
that receives a separate property tax bill from either the Los Angeles or
Orange County Tax Collectors.

The Tax revenues would be used for the purpose of preventing cuts in
educational programs such as college preparation classes, high school
counselors, student health, safety, and security services, maintaining
instructional materials, supplies and classroom technology, keeping school
libraries open, maintaining small class sizes, music and art programs, and
retaining teachers.

An exemption may be granted for any parcels which are owned and
occupied by at least one person aged 65 years or older, upon annual
application to the District. All property that would otherwise be exempt from
ad valorem property taxes will also be exempt from the Tax.

The proceeds of the Tax shall only be applied to the specific purposes
identified and shall be deposited into a special account. An annual written
report shall be prepared by the District and filed with the Board detailing the
amount of funds collected and expended, and the status of any projects
authorized to be funded from the Tax.

This Measure requires a two-thirds (2/3) vote for passage.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE E

Parents, teachers and civic leaders throughout our community urge you to
VOTE YES on Measure E to protect the quality of education in our
neighborhood schools.

Rowland Unified schools are proud to serve students from Rowland
Heights, Walnut, West Covina and La Puente. We are fortunate to have
award winning schools and exceptional academic programs.

But Rowland Unified School District is facing severe budget cuts due to the
current state budget crisis. This year alone, the District was forced to cut
$5.8 million from its budget. Without additional revenue, next year an
additional $9 million in cuts will be required.

Every effort has been made to keep cuts away from the classroom. But now
there is nothing left to cut except quality teachers, educational programs
and small class sizes that allow teachers to give students individual
attention.

Measure E will provide stable, locally controlled funding for Rowland Unified
schools and help avoid further devastating cuts. Measure E MAINTAINS
current programs; it does not establish new ones.

Measure E will:

-	Maintain college preparation classes and high school counselors

-	Preserve student health/safety/security services

-	Provide adequate instructional materials and classroom technology

-	Keep school libraries open

-	Protect small class sizes

-	Maintain music and art programs

-	Retain qualified, experienced teachers

Every Measure E penny will stay local to benefit our neighborhood
schools. This money cannot be taken away by the State.

NO Measure E funding can be spent on administrators’ salaries.

Measure E will last 5 years only. An Independent Citizens’ Oversight
Committee will ensure funds are spent properly. Senior citizens are eligible
for exemption to ensure this measure is not a burden to those living on fixed
incomes.

Good schools protect property values, which is more important now than
ever. Please help protect the quality of education in our local schools.

PLEASE— VOTE YES on E.
