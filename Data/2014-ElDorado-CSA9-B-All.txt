FERNWOOD COTHRIN RANCH ROAD ZONE OF BENEFIT #98114 WITHIN COUNTY SERVICE AREA
#9 - SETTING FOR MAILED BALLOT ELECTION A MEASURE TO INCREASE A SPECIAL TAX FOR
THE PURPOSES OF PROVIDING ROAD IMPROVEMENT AND MAINTENANCE SERVICES.

WHEREAS, the Board of Supervisors of the County of El Dorado has formed County Service Area #9 pursuant to Title 3, Division 2,
Part 2, Chapter 2.2 of the California Government Code; and

WHEREAS, this Board formed Fernwood Cothrin Ranch Road Zone of Benefit #98114 (Zone) on April 30, 1985 by Resolution 91-85 for
the purpose of providing road improvement and maintenance services; and

WHEREAS, California Government Code §25215.2, together with §25217.4, expressly authorizes a zone within a county service area to
levy a special tax for road improvement and maintenance services subject to voter approval; and

WHEREAS, on July 21, 1998, a mailed ballot election was conducted for the Zone, and an annual special tax amount of $150.00 per
parcel was approved by a two-thirds majority of the voters casting a ballot in the special tax ballot proceeding; and

WHEREAS, the advisory committee for the Zone has recommended an increase to the special tax amount to keep pace with increases
in labor and material costs associated with road improvement and maintenance services which have occurred since approval of the
existing special tax;

WHEREAS, pursuant to California State Law, the Board of Supervisors is required to place before the electorate the approval of the
measure as shown on Exhibit A before the special tax can be levied; and

WHEREAS, the County Registrar of Voters has determined that four hundred thirty four registered voters reside within the zone of
benefit boundaries; and

WHEREAS, such a special tax increase shall take effect only if approved by a two-thirds majority of the voters casting a ballot in the
special tax ballot proceeding; and

WHEREAS, the zone advisory committee has determined an annual special tax of $365.00 for each parcel is reasonable and sufficient
to provide road improvement and maintenance services within the zone of benefit commencing in fiscal year 2014/2015;

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED the Board of Supervisors determines as follows:

1.	The measure as shown on Exhibit A shall be submitted to the voters of the Fernwood Cothrin Ranch Road Zone of
Benefit #98114 within County Service Area #9.

2.	The El Dorado County Registrar of Voters shall submit the measure as shown on Exhibit A to the electorate in a mailed
ballot election to be held on May 6, 2014.

3.	The tax amount as shown on Exhibit A, if approved, shall appear as a separate item on the tax bill of each affected
parcel and shall be collected at the same time and manner as county ad valorem property taxes are collected as set
forth in the applicable provisions of the Revenue and Taxation Code, and shall be subject to the same penalties and the
same procedure and sale in the case of delinquency as provided for such taxes. All laws applicable to the levy,
collection and enforcement of county property taxes shall be applicable to such tax.

Exhibit A
SPECIAL TAX BALLOT MEASURE

COUNTY SERVICE AREA #9
FERNWOOD COTHRIN RANCH ROAD ZONE OF BENEFIT #98114
COUNTY OF EL DORADO, STATE OF CALIFORNIA

“Shall an annual special tax in an amount of $365.00 on each parcel of real property be levied within Fernwood Cothrin
Ranch Road Zone of Benefit commencing fiscal year 2014/2015 to be used only for road improvement and
maintenance services, to replace the current special tax?”

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
FERNWOOD COTHRIN RANCH ROAD ZONE OF BENEFIT #98114

MEASURE B

This measure, if approved by 2/3 of the voters voting on the measure, would authorize a special tax on parcels of real property in the
Fernwood Cothrin Ranch Zone of Benefit #98114 within County Service Area #9 (“Zone”) to be used solely for the costs of providing
road improvement and maintenance services within the Zone (“Special Tax”).

This Special Tax for parcels within the boundaries of the Zone would be “an annual special tax in an amount of $365.00 on each parcel
of real property” “commencing fiscal year 2014/2015 to be used only for road improvement and maintenance services, to replace the
current special tax” of $150.00 used for the same purposes.

The Special Tax will be listed as a separate item on the county property tax bill for each affected parcel of land, and will be collected in
the same way as the general property tax. All laws applicable to the levy, collection, and enforcement of county property taxes,
including the provisions for penalties and the procedures for sale of the property in case of delinquency, shall also apply to the special
tax.

State law requires the proceeds from the special tax be applied only to the identified purposes, and that an annual report be made
indicating the amount of funds collected and expended and the status of any project required or authorized to be funded by the
proceeds.

This measure was placed on the ballot by Resolution No. 188-2013 adopted by the El Dorado County Board of Supervisors upon the
recommendation of the Zone advisory committee that determined that an annual special tax of $365.00 for each parcel is reasonable
and sufficient to provide road improvement and maintenance services commencing in fiscal year 2014/15 and to keep pace with
increases in labor and material costs associated with road improvement and maintenance services which have occurred since the
approval of the existing special tax in 1998.

This measure requires an affirmative vote of 2/3 or more of all voters voting on the measure in order to pass.

A “YES” vote is a vote to authorize the special tax provided in the measure.

A “NO” vote is a vote against the special tax provided in the measure.
