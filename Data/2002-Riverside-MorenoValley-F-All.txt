THE UTILITY TAX ORIGINATED WHEN THE COUNCIL COULD DO
SO BY A SIMPLE MAJORITY VOTEOFTHE COUNCIL. THE TAX WAS
f FOR A THREE YEAR TERM.

THE TERM OF THE TAX WAS EXTENDED BY A SIMPLE MAJORITY
VOTE OF THE COUNCIL. AND LATER MADE A PERMANENT TAX BY
THE SAME REQUIRED VOTE.

THE PEOPLE. BY A MAJORITY IN JUNE 1996 VOTED TO
DISCONTINUE THE TAX. THE COUNCIL REJECTED THAT VOTE
AND PLACED THE MATTER ON THE NOVEMBER BALLOT. IT WAS
THEN APPROVED BY THE SAME MAJORITY VOTE.

THE MATTER IS NOW BROUGHT BEFORE THE VOTERS BY
CONCERNED CITIZENS WHO BELIEVE THE CITY COUNCIL
REPRESENTS AN AGENDA THAT IS NOT IN THE BEST INTERESTS
OF THE PUBLIC.

THE CITY MANAGEMENT CLAIMS THAT THE UTILITY TAX iS
NECESSARY TO CONTINUE THE OPERATION OF THE CITY.

IN THE MEANTIME THE CITY COUNCIL CONDUCTS BUSINESS AS

USUAL

THE CITY COUNCIL WANTS A NEW LIBRARY. THEY HAVE
DESIGNATED ONE MILLION DOLLARS FOR PLANS TO BUILD IT
WHILE THEY THREATEN REDUCTION IN PUBLIC SAFETY

SERVICES.

THEY CONTINUE TO PAY 6% ANNUAL BONUSES TO CITY
EMPLOYEES.

THEY HAVE DESIGNATED FUNDS FOR A SPORTS AND

THEY ARE MAKING PLANS FOR A NEW CITY HALL,

Y HAVE DESIGNATED FUNDS TO CREATE AND MAINTAIN A
FORMING ARTS FACILITY ON MARCH ARB.

THEY HAVE DESIGNATED FUNDS FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A
CITY OWNED GOLF COURSE WHICH WILL THEN COMPETE WITH
FOUR OTHER PRIVATELY OPERATED GOLF COURSES IN THE
IMMEDIATE MARKETING AREA.

STILL THE CITY COUNCIL MAINTAINS THAT THEY CANNOT
CONDUCT THE PUBLIC’S BUSINESS WITHOUT THE UTILITY TAX.
THEY THREATEN TO REDUCE BOTH POLICE AND FIRE
PROTECTION IF THE TAX IS REPEALED.

WE URGE YOUR YES VOTE ON MEASURE “F” TO REPEAL THE

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE “F”

Let's go to the bottom line: Moreno Valley needs the utility tax to provide
basic services, including police and fire.

The proponents of Measure F claim that we can lose 20% of the general
budget without affecting public safety. That is simply untrue. ‘Where are
their proposals to cut services? You won’t find a plan because they have
none.

They try to confuse us by claiming the utility tax was defeated in one
election and passed in another by the same majority vote. Not true. They
fail to mention that the first election had a turnout of only 10,184 voters.
They fail to mention voters approved the tax in. the largest turnout in the
City’s history: 32,297 voters.

They somehow won’t believe the Mayor, Sheriff, Sheriff-elect, Fire Chief,
business owners, church and community leaders when they say, “Make
intelligent choices. Protect your family, your home, and your property

values.”

We all know we get what we pay for. How much do you thinfAve are
going to get if we don’t pay?

Most people in Moreno Valley like the city and the services it provides.
We are fortunate that, when compared to other cities of its size, Moreno
Valley operates more economically than most. A short-sighted few don’t
want improvements in our city. They don’t care about cuts in public
services and public safety. Lets not be fooled,

Measure “F” fails Moreno Valley.

PLEASE VOTE NO ON “F"

ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE “F”

In 1996, Moreno Valley voters passed a utility tax so the City could
maintain important services and improve the scope and quality of
services for our growing population. The City delivered.

We have 18 new police officers, a new fire station and a police/fire
headquarters. We have more crossing guards for children, and a city-run
library with more hours.

Property values are up, crime is clown and our future has never looked
brighter.

Measure F will scrap these achievements, forcing the City to eliminate
programs and services that we deserve and depend on.

Local sheriffs and firefighters oppose Measure f because it will cause
sharp reductions in vital law enforcement and tire protection services that
keep us safe. Measure F will eliminate police officers and firefighters,
close one fire station and prevent another from opening. As Moreno
Valley grows, we need to expand public safety services, not cut them.

Parents and teachers oppose Measure f because it would cut a Cross-
ing Guard program that protects children walking to school and reduces
police traffic enforcement at school sites.

Homeowners oppose Measure F because the code enforcement
program will be cut, increasing blight and reducing property values.

Business owners oppose Measure F because they know that fewer
police on our streets, elimination of graffiti clean-up and a reduction in
library hours means more graffiti and juvenile crime. This will drive up

insurance rates and increase operational costs, hurting business
owners.

Join these people, the Chamber of Commerce, Hispanic Chamber of
Commerce, Sheriff-elect Bob Doyle, Former Police Chief Richard Coz,
Former Fire Chief Duane Chamlee, business owner Jan Zuppardo,
Nolan Kerr, Pastor Ray Hahn and other community leaders in
OPPOSING Measure F.

Measure F fails Moreno Valley.

Vote NO on Measure F.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE “F”

IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT PRIORITIES ARE SET BY

THE "CITY COUNCIL.’’ THEY WILL DECIDE BY A SIMPLE MAJORITY
WHAT ITEMS OR PROGRAMS ARE AFFECTED BY THE REPEAL OF

THE UTILITY TAX.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THE PEOPLE WHO OPPOSE
THE EFFORT TO REPEAL THE TAX, WHO THEY ARE, WHOM THEY
REPRESENT AND BY WHOM THEY ARE EMPLOYED. YOU WILL
FIND THAT IN EACH AND EVERY CASE THEIR MOTIVATIONS ARE
BASED ON THE EXISTENCE OF THE TAX.

IT IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE GROUP
WHO CIRCULATED THE PETITION TO REPEAL THIS TAX AND ALL
THOSE WHO SIGNED THE PETITION ARE REGISTERED VOTERS
WITHIN THE CITY OF MORENO VALLEY. MORE THAN 2500 OF
THEM.

THIS IS NOT SO WITH THOSE WHO WOULD KEEP THIS TAX. LOOK
CLOSELY AT THE NAMES AND ADDRESSES OF THOSE WHO
OPPOSE MEASURE “F.”

TO “MANAGE” IS TO PROVIDE DIRECTION. TO EFFECT CONTROL
AS IN “CITY MANAGER.” ACCOUNTABILITY MEANS TO PROVIDE A
REPORT. A STATEMENT OF DEBTS AND CREDITS, A FINANCIAL

RECKONING. AN EXPLANATION. NOT A DEMAND FOR MORE
MONEY.

OUR CITY COUNCIL AND MANAGEMENT HAVE BECOME
ACCUSTOMED TO REACHING INTO THE POCKETS OF THE
TAXPAYER EVERY TIME THEY SEE SOMETHING THEY WANT TO
BUILD OR BUY.

DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE EXPENSIVE MAILERS AND THE SCARE
TACTICS OF THE OPPOSITION, JUST CONSIDER WHO IS PAYING
FOR THEM MAKE THE CITY MANAGEMENT BECOME MANAGERS.
HOLD THE CITY COUNCIL ACCOUNTABLE.

INITIATIVE MEASURE TO BE SUBMITTED DIRECTLY TO THE VOTERS

The City Attorney has prepared the following title and summary of the chief purposes and points of the proposed measure:

BALLOT TITLE

"AN INITIATIVE ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF MORENO VALLEY REPEALING
THE EXISTING 6% UTILITY USER'S TAX AND PROHIBITING THE CITY FROM
IMPOSING A UTILITY USER’S TAX"

IMPARTIAL SUMMARY

The City of Moreno Valley currently Imposes a utility user's tax. The existing tax rate is 6% of utility service charges. It applies to
charges for water, sewer, natural gas, electricity, telephone, cellular telephone, cable television, and wireless pay television. Utility
users pay the tax with their utility bills. The existing tax was approved by the voters at the November 1996 general election.

This initiative ordinance would repeal the existing utility user’s tax. It would prohibit the City from imposing a utility user’s tax In the
future. It could not be amended or repealed without voter approval. If the existing tax were repealed, the State Constitution would
also prohibit the City from adopting a utility user's tax, in any amount without voter approval at a future election.

NOTICE OF INTENT TO CIRCULATE PETITION

Notice is hereby given by the persons whose names appear hereon of their intention to circulate the petition within the City of
Moreno Valley for the purpose of repeal of the City utility user's tax. A statement of the reasons of the proposed action as
contemplated in the petition is as follows:

1.	The Moreno Valley Utility User's Tax was Initially Identified as a Temporary, three year, 6% Tax." It was extended for one
year, (hen made a "Permanent Tax” by the City Council, by removal of the "Sunset Clause" which limited the term of the
tax.

2.	The City of Moreno Valley has continued to collect surplus money from this tax and the City Council has continued to
demonstrate an unwillingness to enact any utility user's tax rate reduction or suspension to help offset the increase in
utility bills.

3.	The dollar amount collected in the form of the Utility User's Tax gets bigger with each increase of utility costs, and the City
Council, rather than provide us with tax relief, finds new projects to which the surplus funds can be dedicated.
