THEREON

ORDINANCE NO: 2017-001

The Board of Directors of the Northshore Fire Protection District does ordain as fol-
lows:

Section 1. Authority

Section 4 of Article XIIIA of the California Constitution permits special district by
two-thirds vote of their qualified electorate to impose a special tax on property.
Health and Safety Code Section 13913 authorizes a fire protection district to im-
pose a special tax pursuant to Government Code Section 53978 for fire protection
and prevention services.

Section 2. Purpose and Intent

It is the purpose of this Ordinance to authorize the levy of a special tax on parcels of
real property on the secured property tax rolls of Lake County that are within the
Northshore Fire Protection District and to expend the revenues therefrom, in order
to augment funding for fire protection and prevention, rescue, emergency medical
services and transportation, hazardous material, and other services relating to the
protection of lives and property. This special tax shall repeal existing 1996 & 2004
special tax for Clearlake Oaks Fire Protection District, Lucerne Recreation and
Park, Nice Community Services District and Upper Lake Fire Protection District.

The special property taxes shall be used solely for the purpose of providing fire pro-
tection, rescue, emergency medical, ambulance and other services within the Dis-
trict, any responses outside of the District under mutual aid agreements with other
fire suppression agencies and any incidental expense relating thereto including ex-
penses related to the collection of the tax.

Because the burden of this falls on property, it is a property tax, but is not deter-
mined according to, nor is it in any manner passed on the value of the property.
This tax is based, to the extent practical, upon the risk of fire or emergency services
and the need for services to each parcel and the improvements thereon. Insofar as
not inconsistent with this Ordinance, such provisions of the California Revenue and
Taxation Code as related to ad valorem property taxes are intended to apply to the
collection and administration of this tax. As authorized by Government Code Sec-

tion 53978, this tax is not an ad valorem tax; the exemptions contained in or
authorized by Article XIII of the California Constitution shall not apply.

Section 3. Definitions

The following definitions shall apply throughout this Ordinance:

1.	“Parcel” means the land and improvements thereon, designated by a parcel
number on an assessor’s parcel map and carried on the secured property tax
roll of Lake County. For purposes of this Ordinance, parcel does not include any
land or improvements outside the boundaries of the Northshore Fire Protection
District.

2.	“Developed Parcel” means any parcel upon which an improvement exists.

3.	“Improvement” means those items included within Revenue and Taxation Code
Section 105 definition of improvements, except for:

a. Fences, poles and walls that are not a part of or connected to a structure

4.	“Year” or “Fiscal Year” means the period of July 1 through the following June 30.

5.	“Taxpayer” means the assesse of the property shown on the secured tax roll or
the person or legal entity actually paying the tax, if different from the assesse.

6.	“District” means the Northshore Fire Protection District.

Section 4. Special Tax & Tax Rate

The Board of Directors of the Northshore Fire Protection District is authorized to
levy a special tax, for the purpose as specified in Section 2, on each parcel of real
property located within the boundaries of the District at a rate not to exceed $4.00
per benefit unit for the first year and is to be adjusted each year thereafter by the
change in the consumer price index. Provided that if at any time the consumer
prices index resulted in anything less than zero, the special tax rate would remain
at the previous year’s rate in an effort to maintain the current level of services. How-
ever provided, that such a special tax shall not be imposed upon property of a fed-
eral, state or local government agency.

The special tax shall be imposed in accordance with the schedule for Units of Ben-
efit attached hereto as Exhibit A. Each land use within a parcel is subject to Units of
Benefit computation and the total of all uses on a parcel shall be computed to be
the tax due to the District.

Section 5. Setting the Tax Rate

At a regularly scheduled Board Meeting in May of each year, the Board of Directors
will set the tax rate for the next fiscal year by adoption of resolution, not to exceed
the amount per benefit unit as set forth in Section 4 above.

Section 6. Collection

The special tax shall constitute a lien against each parcel for which the tax is col-
lected in accordance with Revenue and Taxation Code Section 2187.

The County of Lake shall be charged with the collection of this tax and shall deduct
the reasonable costs incurred by the County from the taxes collected.

Section 7. Ambulance billing for property owners

Northshore Fire Protection District will accept a property owner’s medical insur-
ance payment as payment in full for any emergency medical services rendered.
This is to help subsidize the out of pocket medical expenses incurred by the
individual.

Section 8. Authorization for Spending Limit Increase

To the extent that the revenue from the special property taxes enacted by this Ordi-
nance are in excess of the spending limit for the District as calculated in accor-
dance with the provisions of Article XIII B of the California Constitution and
applicable statutory provisions, the approval of this special property tax by the vot-
ers shall constitute approval to increase the District’s spending limit in the amount
equal to the revenue derived from the special property tax for the maximum period
of time as allowed by law.

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF NORTHSHORE FIRE
PROTECTION DISTRICT MEASURE “E”

Pursuant to Government Code Section 53978, the Northshore Fire Protection Dis-
trict has adopted Ordinance Number 2017-001, an ordinance imposing a special
tax for fire protection and prevention, emergency medical, and other related ser-
vices. A 2/3 vote is required for the approval of this special tax prior to it becoming
effective.

This measure, placed on the ballot by the Northshore Fire Protection District, sub-
mits Ordinance Number 2017-001 for voter approval. Approval by 2/3 of the vot-
ers voting on the measure would authorize a special tax on parcels of real property
in the Northshore Fire Protection District to be used for the costs of funding fire pro-
tection and prevention, rescue, emergency medical services, transportation, haz-
ardous material services, and other services relating to the protection of lives and
property within the Northshore Fire Protection District. State law requires that the
proceeds of a special tax may be used only for the purposes specified and for no
other purpose.

This special tax would be levied on each parcel of real property located within the
Northshore Fire Protection District at a rate not to exceed $4.00 per benefit unit for
the first year, adjusted each year thereafter only in accordance with increases in
the consumer price index. The number of units of benefit applicable to the real
property subject to the proposed tax is as set forth in Exhibit A of Ordinance Num-
ber 2017-001. This special tax would repeal and replace an existing 1996 and
2004 tax for the Clearlake Oaks Fire Protection District, the Lucerne Recreation
and Park District, the Nice Community Services District, and the Upper Lake Fire
Protection District.

The special tax will constitute a lien against each parcel for which the tax is col-
lected, will be listed as a separate item on the county property tax bill for each af-
fected parcel of land, and will be collected in the same way as the general property
tax.

A “YES” vote is a vote to authorize the special tax provided in the measure.

A “NO” vote is a vote against the special tax provided in the measure.

County Counsel

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF
MEASURE “E”

By voting yes on Measure “E”, you have an opportunity to make a lasting change in
the health and wellbeing of our communities. The communities of Upper Lake, Blue
Lakes, Nice, Lucerne, Clearlake Oaks and Spring Valley make up the Northshore
Fire Protection District. In 2006 these 6 communities agreed to merge to become
one independent special district within Lake County. The parcel taxes that were in
place at the time of the consolidation still exist today. For the majority of the com-
munities those special parcel taxes have not been increased since 1996. As an
independent special district, we are not funded by any county or other public entity.
The gap between our funding and the actual cost of service continues to widen
year after year. Our community’s demographics prevent us from recovering our
cost through ambulance revenue. Currently we do not meet the national standards
for staffing based on our call volume. We need your help!!

-► Measure “E” will bridge the gap between our funding and the actual cost
of services.

-► Measure “E” will allow us to staff the Upper Lake Fire Station 24 hours,
365 days a year.

-► Measure “E” will also allow the District to accept any insurance payment
for a medical emergency as payment in full.

-► Measure” E” will add an annual cost of living increase so the district will no
longer lose funding to inflation.

-► Measure “E” will set the special parcel tax rate at an equal amount for all
communities the district serves.

We ask you to approve an increase in the special parcel tax that supports the
Northshore Fire Protection District, which is the foundation for our emergency re-
sponse services. Without this increase, we will be forced to reorganize, which
could include reducing our staffing, longer response times and various other com-
munity services. Voting YES will ensure continued reliable, effective, and fully
funded emergency response.
