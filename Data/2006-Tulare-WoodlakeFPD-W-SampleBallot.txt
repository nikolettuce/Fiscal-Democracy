IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL
MEASURE W

Section 4 of Article XIIIA of the California Constitution and section 50075 of the Government Code authorize a special
district to levy a special tax with voter approval of two-thirds of the qualified electors within the district.

If this measure is approved, the Woodlake Fire Protection District (“District”) will be authorized to increase the existing
special annual tax on the secured tax roll commencing in the 2007-2008 fiscal year. The purpose of this special tax
measure is to preserve the existing equipment and staff levels of the District for emergency response, fire protection,
fire fighting and hazardous materials services. The District must provide the accountability measures called for in
section 50075.1 of the Government Code and will allow the amount of the tax to be appealed directly to the District.

If this measure is approved, the special increased tax shall be levied and collected at the same time and in the same
manner that ad valorem property taxes are levied and collected under the Revenue and Taxation Code. The special tax
levied on each taxable parcel will be based on a standard allocation for a single family residence as the base tax and
adjusted upward for parcels with larger or commercial structures. The tax increase for a parcel with a single family
residence will be $22.60 during the first year. Pursuant to the District’s Resolution No. 02-2006, the special tax
increase may be adjusted each fiscal year thereafter in accordance with the average increase, if any, in the San
Francisco Consumer Price Index for the preceding two-year period. However, the annually adjusted increase cannot
exceed two percent in any fiscal year and the District may levy the tax increase in an amount that is less than the
maximum amount authorized.

This measure makes no change to existing law. The electors entitled to vote on this measure are the registered voters
within the boundaries of the District. If the measure is not approved by at least two-thirds of the votes cast on the
measure, the measure will fail and the special tax increase will not be levied.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE W

Nearly all of us at some time will experience an emergency that requires assistance. Whether the emergency be fire,
medical emergency (heart attack, stroke, etc.), automobile accident, rescue or numerous other types of emergencies, we
know that the Fire Department will come to our aid. Now the Fire Department needs your help. For the past several
years the revenue available has not kept pace with the cost of providing the services we expect from our Fire
Department. The Woodlake Fire District handles over four hundred incidents per year in and around the community of
Woodlake. The fire district has an impressive record of being able to respond to an emergency in Woodlake within a

three to four minute time range, which is now jeopardized.

The Woodlake Fire District is funded through a fire tax and fire assessment for fire protection. The fire tax makes up
for thirty-one percent of the fire Districts annual budget. The fire assessment makes up for sixty-one percent of the
annual budget.

The Woodlake Fire District has worked hard on improving itself with the resources that are available. Most recently is
the improvement of a new garage that houses two fire trucks and a support vehicle that was paid for by a grant from the
City of Woodlake. The Fire District has reserched other alternatives for raising the funds to alleviate the deficit in the
annual budget. But, as a special district there are limitations for how funds can be raised. The community is growing
at a steady rate and with new construction and future new construction being built, the fire department needs to grow as
well.

We ask for your support on this very important measure.
