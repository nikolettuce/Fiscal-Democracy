IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL
MEASURE Y

SPECIAL TAX OF $8.50 TO PROVIDE FOR ONGOING AND ADDITIONAL OPERATIONS AND PROJECTS

Article XIIIA of the California Constitution, Military and Veterans Code section 1192.5 and Government Code section
50075 authorize a special district to levy a special tax on all real property within the district when approved by at least
two-thirds of the qualified electors voting on the measure.

If this measure is approved, the Springville Memorial District (“District”) will be authorized to levy an annual tax of
eight dollars and fifty cents (USD $8.50) upon all assessable parcels of real property within the boundaries of the
District. The stated purpose of this special tax measure is to provide for ongoing and additional operations and projects
of the District, including the lawful operation and maintenance of the District’s building, parking lot, and any parks and
other property. The District must provide the accountability measures called for in section 50075.1 of the Government
Code.

If this measure is approved, the special tax shall be levied and collected at the same time that other real property taxes
are levied and collected by the County of Tulare.

This measure makes no change to existing law. The electors entitled to vote on this measure are the registered voters
within the boundaries of the District. If the measure is not approved by at least two-thirds of the votes cast on the
measure, the measure will fail and the special tax will not be levied.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE Y

A Yes vote for Measure Y will provide the Springville Veterans Memorial District with funding to help it continue
managing and maintaining the Springville Veterans Memorial Building as a tribute to the men and women who have
served our nation in the U.S. armed forces. The building also serves the entire area as a shelter for natural disasters such
as fires and floods. Approval of Measure Y would generate funds to be used to maintain the building which the District
operates on a bare-bones budget, depending heavily on community organizations to provide additional funds and
volunteer labor for building improvements. Additionally, the fixed parcel tax of $8.50 per parcel per year (could not be
increased without another election) will enable the District to assume the management and maintenance of Springville

Park, which would be re-named Springville Veterans Memorial Park. The approval of both Measure X and Y is
necessary to preserve the historic park. A vote for Measure Y is a vote continue Springville’s tradition of honoring our
veterans.
