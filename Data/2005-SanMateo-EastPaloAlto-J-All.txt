A PROPOSED ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF EAST PALO
ALTO AMENDING ORDINANCE NO. 103, AS AMENDED BY
ORDINANCE NO. 169, REGARDING THE UTILITY USERS TAX

Ordinance No. 103, AN ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF EAST
PALO ALTO IMPOSING AN ELECTRICITY, GAS, TELEPHONE AND
WATER USERS TAX, as amended by Ordinance no. 169 to impose said
tax on cable television, is further amended as follows:

SECTION 1. IMPOSITION OF TAX AND SUNSET DATE

further amended to delete the expiration date of November 30, 2006, to
read as follows:

“There is hereby established and imposed a utility users tax in the
amount set forth in this Ordinance for the purpose of raising
revenues for the general governmental purposes of the City. All of
the proceeds of the taxes levied under this Ordinance shall be
placed in the City’s general fund.”

SECTION 2. EFFECTIVE DATE

This Ordinance shall take effect only if a majority of voters voting on
the measure approve this Ordinance at the special municipal election
scheduled for November 8, 2005.

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE J

In November, 2002, East Palo Alto voters approved a measure which
accomplished the following:

•	validated and allowed continued collection of the five percent (5%)
utility users tax until November 30, 2006; and

•	imposed said utility users tax on cellular telephones and similar
communications technology.

The utility users tax, which generates approximately $1.4 million per
year, goes into the City’s General Fund and is used for general government
purposes, including police and public safety, parks and recreation, street
improvements, youth and senior citizen services and the like. The tax is
collected on electricity, gas, telephone, cable, water services and mobile
communication technology such as cellular telephones.

This proposed measure, if approved by a simple majority of voters
voting on the measure, would remove the November 30, 2006 expiration of
the tax, in effect making it permanent.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE J

THIS IS NOT A NEW TAX! We’ve all been paying a utility user tax since
1989. Most cities have a utility user tax. In East Palo Alto, the average
family of four pays about $10 per month in utility users taxes. THE
UTILITY TAX RATE IS NOT INCREASING. The utility tax provides
about $1.4 million a year for general services like parks, recreation, street
maintenance and police services.

The Utility Users Tax has been in place for residential and commercial
utility customers since 1989. Recently, some court decisions have raised
the question whether such a tax is legal if it wasn’t put on the ballot and
approved by voters. In 2002, you approved this tax for four years to make
sure it could not be challenged. This tax is going to expire next year if not
re-approved by voters.

If this Measure wins, the City will sustain this important income source. If
this Measure fails, the City will lose at least $1.4 million a year. Vote
“YES” on this measure.
