IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
CITY OF CALIFORNIA CITY
SPECIAL TAX MEASURE G

If two-thirds of those voting approve, Measure G will authorize the City of
California City to levy a yearly special tax in the amount of $53.00 per parcel
or lot. The tax could be levied for four fiscal years starting July 1,1991. The
proceeds of the tax will be deposited in a special fund and expended only for
municipal purposes. These purposes include the replacement of the annual
assessment levied by the California City Community Services District, the
replacement of taxes for interest and redemption of certain bonds, and the
replacement of water and sewer standby charges once levied by the City.
Approval of this special tax will also constitute approval of an increase in the
appropriations limit for the City by an amount equal to the special tax.

s/ Wayne K. Lemieux
City Attorney

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE G

California City needs to continue its special tax program if the City is to
continue to provide municipal services to inhabitants and property owners.
For the last four years, California City financed much of its operations from a
$53.00 per parcel special tax. The City Council unanimously approved seek-
ing voter approval of a four year extension of the special tax without any
change in rate.

The City works hard to provide needed services. The City Council is always
there to hear your complaints and do something about it. However, the City
cannot take care of your needs without money. We have increased most of
our fees and are in the process of starting a developer fee but the law prevents
us from collecting any more than we are charging. This means that the only
way that we can continue to provide adequate service to you is through the
levy of this tax.

We urge a “yes" vote on Measure G to keep California City moving
forward.
