Dear Voter,

Welcome to the November 2016 Election!

The November 8 ballot features contests from
President and Vice President of the United States to
local special districts. In addition, there are 17 state
propositions and 16 local measures. Only those
local measures that impact where you live will
appear on your ballot.

Clearly the November 2016 is a big ballot with lots
of different contests. I want to remind you that
voting is not a test. You do not have to vote on every
contest.

In November, all voters will receive the same ballot
regardless of your political party or no party
registration.

Some contests allow for write-in candidates and
others do not. The law does not allow write-ins for
the voter-nominated offices of US Senate, US
Representative, State Senate, and State Assembly.

You will find a lot of information in this guide to help
you make your decisions. You can also find
information on our website at
www.votescount.com. In addition, there is another
great website, www.votersedge.com, where
candidates can post information about themselves
free of charge.

If you are signed up to be a permanent vote-by-mail
voter, we will automatically mail you a ballot on
October 10. Be aware that mail can take 3 to 7 days
for delivery.

As a new convenience for our voters, we have
installed new ballot drop boxes available 24/7
located in each of the four cities and at the County
Government Center.

We are here to help and answer any of your
questions. Please call us at 831-454-2060 or email
info@votescount.com

Your vote counts! Thank you for being a voter!

Who is on the ballot for this election?

In the November General Election, all voters receive the same ballot, no matter what political party
you are registered with, or if you have no party preference. The address where you are registered
to vote determines which contests are on your ballot.

In the June Primary Election, all Californians were able to vote to decide which candidates for

For U.S. Representative, 20th District
Party Preference: Democratic

Occupation: Deputy District Attorney	Age:	46

Being a member of Congress is about giving people the opportunity
for a better life.

Growing up on the Central Coast in a household committed to public
service, I've dedicated my career to upholding that tradition.

When I take my daughters to school, I'm proud that they go to the
same public school that I attended. I graduated from Monterey
Peninsula College, UC Davis, and Santa Clara University Law School.

In the District Attorney's Office, I prosecuted violent gang members
and delivered justice for victims and their families. I ensured that
those open to rehabilitation were given resources to move away from
crime.

As an Officer in the U.S. Navy Reserve, I volunteered to serve our
country in Afghanistan and received the Bronze Star Medal.

At home, I worked closely with veterans and local leaders to establish
a veterans cemetery and treatment court, and was recognized as a
2015 Veteran of the Year.

The grandson of immigrants, I'll fight for common sense immigration
reform with a path to citizenship for law-abiding families.

I'll protect jobs in our area by supporting a robust diverse economy in
agriculture, tourism, education, research, small businesses, and high
tech.

I'll be a strong voice to protect our priceless coastline, environment,
and future of our planet.

I'll work tirelessly for pay equity and to protect a woman's right to
choose.

I'll bring energy, new ideas, and a fresh perspective to solve problems
facing Central Coast families.

I’d be honored by your vote.

Casey Lucius

For U.S. Representative, 20th District
Party Preference: Republican

Occupation: Professor/Councilmember/Mother	Age:	40

As a non-partisan elected City Council member, I have a proven
record of building consensus to get things accomplished.

I grew up living in apartments, served seven years in the Navy, and
earned a Masters and PhD. I struggled to pay off student loans. I
worked my way from waitress to professor. I'm married to a retired
Marine and we have a little boy. My family is just like yours.

I am an outsider who will work across the aisle in a non-partisan way
to finally get our problems resolved. The key to success for our
children is a better education. My priorities are protecting the
environment, access to healthcare, and public safety. I will fight for
women's rights and marriage equality.

Year after year, we talk about our poor roads, lack of water storage
and the need for immigration reform. It is time to get these issues
resolved with practical, non-partisan solutions.

My entire life has centered on hard work, commitment and serving
others. I want to serve you. Our families need a thriving economy,
strong businesses that can offer good jobs, safe neighborhoods, and
quality schools. The next generation deserves a chance at the
American Dream and opportunities to succeed, not to be stuck with
trillions of dollars in debt and a broken government.

Vote for real change and a local leader who will represent you. I will
represent you with hard work, honesty and determination. I would
be honored to have your vote.

Bill Monning

For State Senate, 17th District
Party Preference: Democratic

Occupation: California State Senator	Age:	65

Eight years ago, you sent me to Sacramento to make a difference, and
I am proud of what we have been able to accomplish together.

Since joining the State Legislature, I've authored over 80 bills signed
into law by the Governor, including the ground-breaking End of Life
Options Act to give terminally ill patients a compassionate way to take
control of their own lives - subject to strict guidelines.

After years of hard work with many key partners, the new California
Central Coast Veterans Cemetery is scheduled to open this fall. My
legislation in Sacramento and ability to secure funding helped break
the logjam to honor those who served our nation with a final resting
place, fulfilling a promise made over two decades ago.

In Sacramento, we've passed balanced, on-time budgets six years in a
row and put the State's fiscal house in order. We've made great
strides toward tackling our State's pension obligations while restoring
critical funding to education, healthcare, and public safety.

I've earned the highest ratings from the California Labor Federation,
the California League of Conservation Voters, the Sierra Club, and the
Consumer Federation of California.

While our economy has recovered since the Great Recession, we
must continue to focus on creating jobs by strengthening the
backbones of our local economy: agriculture, tourism, and our
educational institutions.

That's why I'm asking you to send me to the State Senate for another
term.

Please visit www.billmonning.org. I'd be honored by your vote on
November 8th. Thank you.

Bill Monning

Para Senado Estatal, Distrito 17
Preferencia de Partido: Democrata

Ocupacion: Senador Estatal de California	Edad:	65

Hace ocho anos, me envio a Sacramento para hacer una diferencia y
estoy orgulloso de lo que hemos logrado juntos.

Desde que me uni a la Legislatura Estatal, fui autor de mas de 80
proyectos de ley que el Gobernador convirtio en leyes, e incluso la Ley
de Opciones de Final de Vida, que fue muy innovadora, para dar a los
pacientes con enfermedades terminales una manera compasiva de
tomar el control de sus propias vidas - sujeta a pautas estrictas.

Despues de anos de trabajo duro con muchos socios clave, esta
programada la inauguracion del nuevo Cementerio de Veteranos de la
Costa Central de California este otono. Mi legislacion en Sacramento y
mi capacidad para garantizar fondos ayudaron a desbloquear la
situacion para honrar a aquellos que sirvieron a nuestra nacion con un
lugar de descanso eterno y asi cumplir una promesa realizada hace
mas de dos decadas.

En Sacramento, hemos aprobado presupuestos equilibrados y
oportunos durante seis anos seguidos y ordenamos las cuentas
fiscales del Estado. Hemos hecho grandes avances para ocuparnos de
las obligaciones de jubilaciones del Estado mientras restauramos los
importantes fondos para educacion, atencion medica y seguridad
publica.

Obtuve los puntajes mas altos de la Federacion Laboral de California,
la Liga de Votantes Conservadores de California, el Club Sierra y la
Federacion de Consumidores de California.

Mientras que nuestra economia se ha recuperado desde la Gran
Recesion, debemos continuar concentrandonos en crear empleos
mediante el fortalecimiento de los pilares de nuestra economia local:
agricultura, turismo y nuestras instituciones educativas.

Es por eso que le estoy pidiendo que me envie al Senado Estatal para
otro periodo.

Por favor visite www.billmonning.org. Seria un honor tener su voto el
8 de noviembre. Gracias.

Palmer Kain

For State Senate, 17th District
Party Preference: Republican

Occupation: Community Volunteer	Age:	37

During my service in the U.S. Army stationed overseas, I developed a
powerful work ethic and was instilled with a deeper commitment to
duty, honor and justice. I have built a strong track record as a capable
manager of people, resources and logistics while proving myself as a
leader who fosters unity and consensus to complete any mission he is
chosen to lead. My mission as your next State Senator is to defend
the freedom, rights, and quality of life of all citizens of the 17th
District.

In more than twenty years of experience in local, state, and national
politics, I have learned how to create tangible, positive change in a
system that often suppresses it. For decades, our district and state
have used short-term solutions for long-term problems. The
consequences being a rise in crime, homelessness, unemployment,
tax rates, public corruption and inequality. We cannot afford to be
complacent anymore. Sacramento has no long-term sustainable
action plans, I do.

Sacramento has chosen to serve the needs of special interest groups
while neglecting the people of California. I will return the power back
to the people, to usher in a new era of transparency, accountability,
and community engagement in politics. There is a new day dawning in
California. Visit palmerkain.org to see my vision and plan. Vote for
Palmer Kain on November 8, and I promise to work hard in your best
interest as your next State Senator. Let's shatter the status quo and
transform California together.

Karina Cervantez Alejo

For State Assembly, 30th District

Party Preference: Democratic

Occupation: Educator/Mayor Pro-Tempore	Age: 36

As a daughter of farm workers, I understood how hard my parents
worked everyday to make ends meet. It is the story of many families
throughout the region. I was the first in my family to go to college,
and soon, a PhD from UC Santa Cruz.

My life in public service has been dedicated to creating safer and
healthier communities by working with at-risk youth, developing
leadership and after-school programs, and working as an educator at
CSU Monterey Bay.

As mayor and councilmember, I've been an effective voice for
working families—expanding crime prevention programs for youth
and strengthening our police, fire and emergency response services.

In Sacramento, I will put what is best for our communities ahead of
party politics. Til work to bring people together to solve problems
and get things done—like creating more jobs, supporting agriculture
and small business, keeping college affordable and lessening the
burden of debt for students, improving our roads and highways,
cutting government waste and balancing our state budget. I will fight
to get big, special interest money out of politics and restore our
democracy.

I am also the ONLY candidate who can serve our Assembly District for
more than just one term.

I’m proud to be the ONLY candidate officially endorsed by a broad
coalition of individuals and organizations including local law
enforcement, teachers, school employees, nurses, and leaders from
all political parties.

This November 8th, I respectfully ask for your support for State
Assembly.

Anna Caballero

For State Assembly, 30th District
Party Preference: Democratic

Occupation: Independent Small Businesswoman

You know me. I have dedicated my career to making our community a
better place to live. I moved to Monterey County 36 years ago to work
as a lawyer for farmworkers. I later started the non-profit "Partners for
Peace" to develop strategies to reduce youth violence. We focused on
early childhood education, literacy, school safety, afterschool
programs, youth employment and strengthening family
communication.

I served as your City Councilmember, Mayor, and State
Assemblymember. In the Assembly, I helped lead early efforts to deal
with California's water crisis. Five years ago Jerry Brown asked me to
serve in his Cabinet to help reduce California's $26 billion dollar budget
deficit. I worked with the Governor to make the state more efficient,
customer service oriented and fiscally accountable. I enjoyed working
with the Governor to help resolve issues that threatened our
community; like getting state approval for local public school
construction to make them safe, funding affordable housing projects
and helping federal and local authorities make the new Veterans
Cemetery at Fort Ord a reality.

With encouragement from local leaders I returned home to finish what
I started. I will stand up for you and make sure that the needs of our
communities are being met. We need someone with experience, who
has worked with Governor Brown and knows how to get things done to
solve the problems of homelessness, youth violence and the needs of
returning veterans. Honor me with your vote. I know how to get things
done.

Argument for Measure D

Rebuttal to argument for Measure D

Vote YES on D to Get Santa Cruz County Moving!

Whether we travel on foot, by bicycle, car or bus we all
agree it should be safer, faster and easier to get where
we're going.

Many local streets and roads are in poor condition,
highways are crowded and public transportation suffers
from state and federal budget cuts. Options for safe biking
are limited, cut-through traffic threatens neighborhood
safety and there aren't enough sidewalks and safe
crossings for pedestrians.

Our traffic congestion is so bad that critical police, fire and
ambulance response time is often lost on crowded local
highways. Measure D can improve the outcomes for those
in need of 911 emergency services.

Cuts in federal and state funding have significantly
reduced funding for transportation improvements.

Measure D is the only option to address these issues.

Measure D is the solution to Get Santa Cruz County
moving:

•	Fix potholes

•	Ease traffic congestion on Highway 1 and other
congested roads

•	Speed up emergency response

•	Improve safety for children walking and bicycling
near schools

•	Expand safe bike routes

•	Maintain senior and disabled transit services

•	Improve traffic flow on highways and reduce
dangerous neighborhood cut-through traffic

•	Preserve transportation options on the rail corridor

•	Invest in transportation projects that reduce pollution
causing global warming

Best of all. Measure D funding can't be taken away by
the state or federal government. In fact, without
Measure D, Santa Cruz County will continue missing out
on millions of available matching funds that will go to
neighboring counties.

Measure D will fund the most environmentally sustainable
local transportation improvement plan in California. It
provides more than $100 million for safer bike routes and
protects vital transit services so we can reduce reliance on
automobiles.

It's time to act. The longer we wait, the more costly these
improvements become. Get Santa Cruz County Moving!
Vote YES on Measure D!

The proponents of Measure D make multiple unsupported
claims:

Claim 1: Measure D will "ease traffic congestion on
Highway 1 and other congested roads".

Fact: Widening Highway 1 will not ease traffic congestion
on Highway 1 or local streets. Caltrans reports that
widening "would not achieve sufficient congestion relief
to attract any substantial number of vehicles that had
diverted to the local street system back to the freeway." -
Caltrans Draft Environmental Impact Report on Highway 1,
p2.1.5-16. (More at WideningWontWork.org)

Claim 2: "Measure D will fund the most environmentally
sustainable local transportation improvement plan in
California".

Fact: San Francisco Bay Area's commuter benefits
programs and excellent public transportation systems are
already far ahead of Santa Cruz County in terms of
environmental sustainability.

Claim 3: Measure D "will reduce reliance on automobiles".
Fact: Spending $100 million to widen Highway 1 will
attract more cars, and divert 30 years of public funds from
programs that would offer commuters options besides
being stuck in traffic on Highway 1.

Claim 4: Measure D will "protect vital transit services".
Fact: Measure D will not restore the recent 12% cut in
METRO service let alone provide the funds for expanding
needed public transportation choices.

Claim 5: Measure D will improve safety.

Fact: Caltrans reports that after widening Highway 1
collision rates would stay the same and more vehicles
would fill the highway. That means a higher overall
number of collisions.

Please vote NO on Measure D. Let us work together for a
better measure—with solutions that work.

Measure D will not provide our County with the effective
transportation system we need.

Measure D would waste $100 million to add lanes to
Highway 1. A survey of highway studies conducted at UC
Davis concludes that adding lanes does not improve traffic
flow over the long term. The Caltrans Environmental
Impact Report on Highway 1 confirms that there would be
negligible congestion relief from the proposed project due
to an increase in auto traffic (see our website for details:
https://WideningWontWork.org)

Cities and counties in the S.F. Bay Area have been
successful using less costly strategies to reduce traffic
congestion and pollution. Recently introduced commuter
benefits programs offered through employers eliminated
4.2 million solo vehicle trips and their associated emissions
in 12 months. No sales tax revenues were needed, and
employers and workers received federal tax breaks.

Measure D won't even provide sufficient funds to maintain
current bus service, let alone create new programs such
as bus rapid transit that can accommodate large numbers
of riders.

If Measure D is defeated, we can pass a better ballot
measure in a couple of years—a measure that would offer
alternatives for commuters stuck on Highway 1, as well as
road repair, safe routes to schools, and a trail along the
rail corridor.

If Measure D passes, we will be stuck with 30 years of
bond payments for a strategy that doesn't work.

As County voters have already done in the past, we
need to reject highway widening and work for a
better measure.

We need a ballot measure that serves all members of our
community without producing increased greenhouse
gases that destabilize the climate, without destroying
trees and wetlands, and without enabling urban sprawl.

Santa Cruz County can do better.

Please vote NO on Measure D.

Don't be fooled: Measure D opponents aren't working for
sustainable, community-wide transportation solutions.
They prefer doing nothing to solve our transportation
problems rather than accept modest compromises that
address everyone's needs.

Twelve years in the making. Measure D is our best chance
to upgrade transportation in Santa Cruz County. If
Measure D fails our problems will grow worse and become
more expensive to fix over the next twelve years - and
we'll forfeit millions in state matching funds.

Measure D has been carefully vetted through an
exhaustive community-wide process. It'll help everyone -
whether you travel by car, bike, bus, rail - or on foot.

Measure D will relieve congestion on Highway 1 and other
clogged corridors using proven methods. The University of
California Transportation Center study cited by our
opponents actually shows Measure D will help reduce
greenhouse gases.

Everyone experiences high blood pressure or loses time
away from their families while stuck in traffic -
particularly people living in Watsonville and South County.

Other benefits include:

•	Fixing potholes and repairing roads

•	Neighborhood relief from cut-through traffic

•	Speeding up 911 emergency response times

•	Improving traffic safety near schools

•	Protecting essential transit services, many for senior
citizens and the disabled

•	Over $130M to make Santa Cruz County a safer place
for people bicycling

Many of us don't love every single aspect of Measure D,
but we recognize that we need a balanced, sustainable
plan that benefits all of us.

Join environmental leaders, commuters, parents, cyclists,
bus riders and seniors from across the county in voting
Yes on Measure D.

It's time for a solution.

Impartial analysis of Measure D

Dana McRae, County Counsel

By Jane M. Scott, Assistant County Counsel

If this measure is approved by at least two-thirds of those voting on it, it will enact ordinance no. 2016-01 of the Santa
Cruz County Regional Transportation Commission. The ordinance will cause the retail transactions and use tax rates
("sales tax") imposed within Santa Cruz County to increase by half of one percent for a thirty-year period in order to pay
for the transportation projects described in the ordinance and its expenditure plan which are printed in the ballot
pamphlet. If approved, it is expected to take effect in or around April 2017.

The ordinance sets out accountability requirements, as well as exemptions and exclusions from the new tax. It also
establishes that the constitutional appropriations limit will include the taxes which are collected.The sales tax increment
proposed by this measure would apply within the cities as well as the unincorporated areas of the County. Those
jurisdictions have differing sales tax rates for the transactions within their boundaries. Currently and prior to this
proposed increase, the sales tax rates are: 8.75% within the cities of Capitola, Santa Cruz, and Scotts Valley; 9.0% within
the City of Watsonville; and 8.25% in the unincorporated areas of the County. Following this election, the rates would
be subject to further change as might be permitted or required by State law.

This election was requested by the Santa Cruz County Regional Transportation Commission, and was called by the Santa
Cruz County Board of Supervisors as requested by the Commission.

A "yes" vote is to adopt the ordinance and approve the increase in the sales tax.

A "no" vote is against the increase in the sales tax.

of the projects to be funded using the Transportation Tax, such as coordination with other responsible agencies as
well as project delivery and negotiation of project agreements. These purposes include expenditures for planning,
environmental reviews, engineering and design costs, and related right-of-way acquisition. Expenditures may also
include, but are not limited to, payments to the County of Santa Cruz for any election costs as set forth in the

reserves in connection with the issuance of the same.

Section 6. ADMINISTRATION OF PLANS. The Authority shall impose the Transportation Tax and enter into an

agreement with the State Board of Equalization to collect the funds, may at the discretion of the Authority's governing

Tax consistent with the Ordinance and Expenditure Plan, and shall administer the Ordinance and Expenditure Plan

Local ballot measure: D

included in this Ordinance, consistent with the provisions and priorities of the Ordinance and Expenditure Plan,
consistent with the authority cited herein.

Section 7. CREATION OF SPECIAL FUND. The Authority shall establish a new fund entitled "Transportation Tax
Regional Transportation Fund". All Transportation Tax Revenue, plus interest, will be deposited in the special fund. The
fund authorized hereunder will be administered by the Authority pursuant to this Ordinance and the provisions of
Division 19 (commencing with Section 180000) of the California Public Utilities Code, and Part 1.6 (commencing with
Section 7251) of Division 2 of the California Revenue and Taxation Code.

Section 8. IMPLEMENTATION.

A.	Projects and programs funded in the Expenditure Plan will be implemented over the 30-year time horizon of the
Transportation Tax. Three types of investments are funded by the Expenditure Plan: investment categories which are
allocated a percentage of net revenues, capital investments which are allocated specific dollar amounts, and
ongoing direct allocations of a percentage of net revenues to be distributed to cities, the County of Santa Cruz, and
transit operators for capital projects and operations. Capital investments will be made based upon clearly defined
project descriptions and limits resulting from the outcomes of environmental analyses, as applicable. The Authority
shall distribute revenues no less than quarterly to local jurisdictions, the Santa Cruz Metropolitan Transit District,
and the Consolidated Transportation Service Agency based on the formulas set forth in the Expenditure Plan, in
accordance with the Act and this Ordinance.

B.	The Santa Cruz County Regional Transportation Commission, which currently allocates, administers and oversees
the expenditure of federal, state and Transportation Development Act funding for local and regional transportation
projects and programs, in its role as the Authority shall allocate, administer and oversee the expenditure of all
Measure Revenues which are not directly allocated by formula annually to other agencies, consistent with the
Expenditure Plan, as it may be amended in accordance with the Act and this Ordinance through an Implementation
Plan, which it will update at least every 5 years, following a public hearing. The purposes of the Implementation Plan
are to define the scope, cost, and delivery schedule of each Expenditure Plan project or program, detail the revenue
projections and possible financing tools needed to deliver the Expenditure Plan within the 30 years promised to
voters, and describe the risks, critical issues and opportunities that the Authority should address to expeditiously
deliver the Expenditure Plan. The Implementation Plan may be amended by a majority vote of the Authority,
however, amendment of the Implementation Plan shall not serve to amend provisions of the Expenditure Plan.

C.	Agencies implementing the Expenditure Plan projects may accumulate revenue over multiple years so that sufficient
funding is available for larger and long-term projects. Any interest income earned on funds allocated pursuant to
this ordinance shall be expended only for the purposes for which the funds were allocated.

Section 9. LEVERAGING FUNDS. Leveraging or matching of outside funding sources is strongly encouraged. Any
additional transportation revenues made available through their replacement by matching funds will be spent based on
the principles outlined for fund allocations described in the Ordinance and Expenditure Plan.

Section 10. BONDING AUTHORITY. Pay-as-you-go financing is the preferred method of financing transportation
improvements and programs under this Ordinance. However, if determined by the board of the Authority to be cost
effective and to accelerate implementation of projects, the Authority may decide to use bond financing as an alternative
method. Upon voter approval of this Ordinance, the Authority shall have the power to sell or issue, from time to time, on
or before the collection of taxes, bonds, or other evidence of indebtedness, in an aggregate principal amount at any one
time outstanding not to exceed the estimated proceeds of the Transportation Tax, and to secure such indebtedness
solely by way of future collection of the Transportation Tax, for capital outlay expenditures for the purposes set forth in
this Ordinance, including, but not limited to, carrying out the transportation projects described in the Expenditure Plan,
consistent with the Section 180250 of the Public Utilities Code.

Section 11. COOPERATIVE FUND AGREEMENTS. To maximize the effective use of funds, revenues may be transferred
or exchanged between or among jurisdictions receiving funds from this measure. Jurisdictions receiving funds may, by
annual or multi-year agreement, exchange funds provided that the percentage of funds allocated as provided in the
Expenditure Plan is maintained over the duration of the period of time the tax is imposed. Agreements to exchange funds,
including fund repayment provisions, must be approved by the Authority and shall be consistent with all rules adopted or
approved by the Authority relating to such exchanges. The Authority may exchange revenues for State or federal funds
allocated or granted to any public agency within or outside the area or jurisdiction of the Authority to maximize
effectiveness in the use of the revenues. Such federal or State funds shall be distributed in the same manner as revenues
derived from this ordinance. The Authority shall maintain for public review an accounting of all balances that are subject
to cooperative agreements approved pursuant to this section.

Local ballot measure: D

Section 12. ADMINISTRATIVE AND IMPLEMENTATION COSTS.

A.	The Authority shall expend only that amount of the Transportation Tax Revenue for staff support, audit,
administrative expenses, and contract services that is necessary and reasonable to carry out its responsibilities
pursuant to Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code. Pursuant to Section 180109 of the Public Utilities Code,
the Authority shall not expend more than one percent of the funds generated pursuant to Division 19 of the Code
for administrative salaries and benefits net of the amount of fees paid to the State Board of Equalization for
collection of the transactions and use tax and prior to the distribution of the Transportation Tax Revenue as
provided in the Expenditure Plan (Exhibit A).

B.	In order to ensure that the cost of administration, implementation and oversight this Measure are not borne by other
programs and sources, such as Transportation Development Act-funded programs, any funds necessary for
administrative, implementation and oversight of the Ordinance and Transportation Tax shall be paid by Measure
Revenues. These functions include audits, programming processes, reporting, financial management, compiling and
publishing an annual report, providing public information concerning the Ordinance, rent, supplies, consulting
services, overhead, legal, other responsibilities as may be necessary to administer the Ordinance and Expenditure
Plan. Costs of performing or contracting for project-related work shall be paid from the revenues of the
Transportation Tax allocated to the appropriate purpose and project.

Section 13. EXECUTION OF DUTIES. The Authority may engage, contract with, employ and compensate any public or
private agency, party, contractor or professional, in accordance with the Public Contract Code and/or any of the
provisions for public employment of profession services for public agencies, for the planning, finance, approval, design,
construction, acquisition of right of way, maintenance, operation, control and repair of any road, highway, bus, rail or
other transportation facility. However, the Authority shall not be responsible for the maintenance or operation of any
State highway facilities following construction contract completion.

Section 14. ELECTION. The Authority requests the Board of Supervisors to call an election for voter approval of this
Ordinance, which election shall be held on November 8, 2016. The election shall be called and conducted in the same
manner as provided by law for the conduct of elections by a county. Pursuant to Section 180203 of the Public Utilities

shall include delivery charges, when such charges are subject to the state sales and use tax, regardless of the place to
which delivery is made. In the event a retailer has no permanent place of business in the State or has more than one
place of business, the place or places at which the retail sales are consummated shall be determined under rules and
regulations to be prescribed and adopted by the State Board of Equalization.

DESCRIPTION OF PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS TO BE FUNDED

The Expenditure Plan identifies transportation projects to be funded from a new one-half of one percent transactions
and use tax, to be collected for thirty (30) years, if two-thirds of voters approve the ballot measure in 2016. The
Expenditure Plan is presented to the voters of Santa Cruz County as a means to address insufficient funding to meet
current and projected transportation needs in Santa Cruz County. Given current sales tax receipts, one-half of one
percent transaction and use tax is expected to generate $17 million a year in 2016 dollars, totaling approximately $500
million for transportation investments. These local funds can be used to leverage state and federal transportation funds

Local ballot measure: D

that would otherwise be unavailable. The investments described in the Expenditure Plan reflect the best efforts to
achieve consensus among varied transportation needs of Santa Cruz County residents.

Three types of investments are funded in the Expenditure Plan: investment categories which are allocated a percentage
of net revenues, capital investments which are allocated specific dollar amounts, and ongoing direct allocations of a
percentage of net revenues to cities, the County of Santa Cruz, and transit operators for capital projects and operations.
The following describes the investments funded by the Santa Cruz County 2016 Transportation Improvement Plan -
Expenditure Plan.

Neighborhood Projects - 30% per year
Direct Allocation to Cities and County

The existing local street and road, bicycle, and pedestrian systems are critical to the everyday movement of people
within the county. Much of the local roadway system is aging, has potholes, and is in need of major repair. Continued
deferred maintenance will result in an exponential increase in the cost of maintaining the roadway system. Additionally,
many sections of the county currently have inadequate facilities for bicyclists and pedestrians to travel safely. Current
resources, without generation of new revenues for transportation, cannot provide adequate funding to maintain the
local roadway system at the level necessary to adequately serve the public or expand the bicycle and pedestrian system
to encourage more users.

Approximately $135 million ($4.5 million per year) in Measure Revenues will be allocated to the cities of Capitola, Santa
Cruz, Scotts Valley, and Watsonville and the County of Santa Cruz for transportation projects. Projects to be funded with
Measure Revenues may include: fixing potholes, local roadway repairs, rehabilitation, reconstruction and intersection
improvements; new and improved sidewalks, crosswalks and bicycle lanes and paths, especially near schools; and other
transportation projects as necessary for the benefit of residents in those jurisdictions. The County of Santa Cruz and the
cities of Capitola, Santa Cruz, Scotts Valley and Watsonville, who are best able to determine their local transportation
needs, shall each prepare an annual report through a public process to identify how they plan to spend their share of
measure funds and how measure funds were spent in the prior year.

Funds will be distributed at least quarterly to cities and the County of Santa Cruz based on each jurisdiction's
proportional share of the countywide population (29%), lane miles of roadway (39%) and site where the Measure
Revenue from the transaction and use tax is generated (32%). Population, road mile, and tax site generation figures will
be updated each year based on the latest available data.

San Lorenzo Valley Highway 9 Corridor

Ten ($10) million in Measure Revenues is designated for transportation projects improving travel for residents of San
Lorenzo Valley. Example projects may include:

•	Safety projects for people walking, biking or driving in the Highway 9 corridor through San Lorenzo Valley

•	Projects that provide safe access to schools along or near Highway 9

•	Intersection and signal improvements

•	Bicycle lanes, paths and/or signage

•	Accessible pedestrian crosswalks and sidewalks, including lighting and flashing pedestrian beacons that increase
visibility

•	Improved access to bus stops and bus service
Highway 17 Wildlife Crossing

Highway 17 is a major connection between the Monterey Bay Region and San Francisco Bay Area. The dense traffic,
concrete median barriers, and lack of drainage culverts and/or bridge undercrossings makes Highway 17 a major barrier
for wildlife moving through the Santa Cruz Mountains. Mountain lions, bobcats and deer have all been hit trying to cross
Highway 17 which also makes it dangerous for the motorists. Five ($5) million in Measure Revenues will be allocated for
construction of a safe passage for wildlife to cross under Highway 17. This project will improve safety for both drivers
and wildlife.

Highway Corridors - 25%

Aging highway systems continue to operate under high traffic volumes as population, and thus demand for moving
people and goods increases. State highways provide essential mobility for Santa Cruz County residents, businesses, and
visitors. The highway corridors are the region's main thoroughfares with Highway 1 carrying over 100,000 people daily.
Measure Revenues are needed to improve traffic flow and safety as state and federal formula funds do not fund most
highway improvements in Santa Cruz County. Measure Revenues (25% or approximately $125 million total) will be
allocated to Highway 1 and Highway 17 corridor projects to increase the safety and efficiency of these corridors in Santa
Cruz County.

Local ballot measure: D

Highway 1 Corridor

Highway investments included in the Expenditure Plan, improve traffic flow and safety on Highway 1, especially for South
County and Mid-County commuters, small businesses, bus riders and first responders (law enforcement, fire, medical) by
adding auxiliary lanes between three interchanges: 41st Ave-Soquel Dr; Bay Ave/Porter St-Park Ave; and State Park Dr-
Park Ave. Auxiliary lanes are lower cost highway projects that can improve flow by separating entering or exiting traffic
from the through lanes. Approximately 10% of all of the injuries and fatalities in Santa Cruz County in 2013 occurred
between Soquel Dr and Park Ave on Highway 1. Auxiliary lanes can help to improve safety on this high traffic volume
corridor.

New bridges for cyclists and pedestrians

Highways can separate neighborhoods and make it harder to ride a bike or walk to access locations of interest. In order
to improve bicycle and pedestrian movement between neighborhoods, employment, retail, medical, and recreation sites
on either side of Highway 1, Measure Revenues can be used to construct bicycle/pedestrian bridges crossing over
Highway 1 including crossings in Live Oak near Chanticleer Avenue and in Aptos/Seacliff near Mar Vista Elementary
School. Measure Revenues can also improve bicycle and pedestrian facilities on existing crossings.

Traveler Information and Transportation Demand Management

The efficiency of the existing transportation system can be increased by promoting use of transit, carpooling, vanpooling,
as well as bicycling and walking. Transportation demand management strategies can reduce the number of vehicles on
our roadways especially during peak periods. Examples of transportation demand management programs that could be
funded by this measure include "Cruz511", the traveler information service for Santa Cruz County, and carpool/vanpool
programs.

Highway Safety and Congestion Reduction Programs

Improving safety is a primary goal of this measure. Programs that reduce fatal and injury collisions on highways and
reduce congestion are also funded by Measure Revenues. Examples of programs that improve safety and reduce
congestion are the Safe on 17 Task Force and the Freeway Service Patrol (roving tow trucks that remove stalled or
disabled vehicles, debris, and other obstructions that may cause backups).

Transportation for Seniors and People with Disabilities - 20% per year

Direct Allocation to Service Providers

Seniors and disabled persons make up an increasing percentage of Santa Cruz County's population. For seniors and
persons with disabilities, access to healthcare, social services, shopping, and recreation is key to quality of life. A number
of specialized transportation programs have been implemented which meet specialized needs for transportation to
medical services, social service programs, shopping and other purposes that cannot be met by conventional bus transit.
An aging population will require maintenance and expansion of transit and paratransit services for elderly and disabled
residents into the future.

Measure Revenues (16% or approximately $2.75 million per year) will be distributed to Santa Cruz Metropolitan Transit
District (METRO) to provide transit and paratransit service for seniors and people with disabilities. Measure Revenues (4%
or approximately $680,000 per year) will be allocated to the Consolidated Transportation Services Agency for Santa Cruz
County (Community Bridges-Lift Line) for paratransit service. Paratransit works with social service agencies to increase
transportation options for seniors, individuals with disabilities, and persons with low incomes. Funds will be distributed at
least quarterly.

Active Transportation - 17%

Monterey Bay Sanctuary Scenic Trail (Coastal Rail Trail)

Measure Revenues (17% or approximately $85 million total) will be allocated for the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Scenic
Trail Network, otherwise known as the Coastal Rail Trail, for people walking and bicycling along the coast in Santa Cruz
County. The coastal rail and trail corridor connects Watsonville, Aptos, Capitola, Live Oak, Santa Cruz, and Davenport and
links to trails in Monterey County. The trail offers spectacular views of the Monterey Bay, historic trestles, and a flat
surface free of automobile traffic. This trail will provide kids, commuters and recreational bicyclists and walkers a safe
and enjoyable way to travel. Funds will be used for trail construction, maintenance, operation, management and
drainage of the rail and trail corridor and will leverage other state and federal grants for completion of the trail network.

Rail Corridor - 8%

Infrastructure Preservation and Analysis of Options

Eight percent of Measure Revenues (approximately $40 million total) will be used for preservation of the Rail Corridor
infrastructure and analysis of its future potential use to better serve Santa Cruz County residents and visitors. Projects

Local ballot measure: D

include analysis (including environmental and economic analysis) to answer important community questions about
possible future transit and other transportation uses of the corridor through an open, transparent public process; and
maintaining and repairing the publicly-owned Santa Cruz Branch Rail Line. The Measure Revenues do not include funding
for any new train/rail service. If the Regional Transportation Commission determines that the best use of the corridor is
an option other than rail transit, funds may be utilized for other transportation improvements along and near the
corridor.

Notes

(1)	Estimated revenues from a Vz-cent transaction and use tax are $17 million per year (in 2016 dollars) for 30 years. The
present value (7.e., present day purchasing power) of the Measure Revenues is forecasted to be approximately $500
Million. The actual revenues to be received over the 30-year life of the tax will be affected by various economic factors,
such as inflation and economic growth or decline. The estimated amounts for each category reflect the allocation of
approximately $500 Million. The estimated amounts for each category, divided by $500 Million, establishes ratios for the
allocation among the categories. While total revenues will vary, the net percentages to each investment category will
remain constant over the 30-year life of the tax.

(2)	Percentages are net after costs required for administration, implementation and oversight of the measure -
including annual independent fiscal audits, reports to the public, preparation and implementation of state-mandated
reports, oversight committee, and other administration, implementation and oversight responsibilities as may be
necessary to administer and implement the Ordinance and the Expenditure Plan. Administrative salaries and benefits
shall not exceed 1% of total Measure Revenues.

(3)	If bonding is used to advance implementation of any of these projects, finance costs will be paid from the percent of
funds designated for the associated investment category.

(4)	it is anticipated that a portion of the total costs of the projects included in the Expenditure Plan will also be funded
from federal, state, and local sources, as described in the Regional Transportation Plan (RTP).

(5)	Outside of the funds to local jurisdictions and transit agencies which will be allocated on an ongoing basis, based on
revenues generated, the Santa Cruz County Regional Transportation Commission shall allocate Measure Revenues to all
other categories of transportation projects and specific capital projects. Capital investments will be made based upon
clearly defined project descriptions and limits resulting from the outcomes of environmental analyses, design
engineering, and public input, as applicable.

(6)	In the event that any agency that is designated funds through the Expenditure Plan is dissolved, the redistribution of
funds will be based on the same formulas minus the dissolved agency. New or successor entities that come into
existence in Santa Cruz County during the life of the Expenditure Plan, such as incorporation of a new city, merging of
agencies, or designation of a new agency as the county Consolidated Transportation Services Agency or transit agency,
may be considered as eligible recipients of funds through the amendment process as set forth in the Ordinance.

Rebuttal to argument for Measure E

VOTE YES ON MEASURE E - THE CANNABIS BUSINESS TAX

Santa Cruz County voters overwhelmingly approved the
Measure K Cannabis Business Tax in 2014 with 77.54% of
the vote. Santa Cruz County has a history of supporting
State and local laws for the compassionate and safe use
of medicinal cannabis by physician's recommendation.
Residents have strongly supported safe access to medical
cannabis for patients in need.

As a result, Santa Cruz County continues to work
successfully with neighborhood groups and local industry
representatives to create laws allowing cannabis to be
responsibly cultivated, distributed, delivered, dispensed,
sold, or given away without creating a public nuisance.

These laws respect the needs of medical patient and their
caregivers, as well as legitimate medical cannabis
businesses. They also protect our neighborhoods and land
from illegitimate operators who harm our environment
and neighborhoods.

With the recent changes in State law by the Medical
Marijuana Regulatory and Safety Act (MMRSA), the County
is seeking to amend the language of Measure K to
conform to the new State law, defining "cannabis,"
"cannabis business," and "medical marijuana business" to
be the same as that in MMRSA.

The Cannabis Business Tax currently provides general
purpose funding for County services including:

•	public health and safety;

•	fire services;

•	environmental protection;

•	animal shelter and community programs; and

•	financial accountability.

Measure E will not change the current tax rate or the
purposes for which the tax is used. All revenue
collected will stay local, to protect and maintain our
neighborhoods and environment.

Voting yes will not disadvantage low income patients,
as there are resources for income restricted patients
to receive low or no cost medicine.

Measure E maintains the business tax only for cannabis
businesses, not all businesses.

Measure E is supported unanimously by the Board of
Supervisors and will help maintain essential services for
County residents.

Join us in voting YES ON MEASURE E.

Please Vote No.

The Tax amendment now includes patients' and
caregivers' cultivation. The previous elections had support
by patient dispensaries and cultivators. They were soon to
discover the true meaning of this tax when Sheriff's
Deputies showed up at their homes and gardens with
machine guns while children and other family members
were present to remove crops.

My receipts show proof the pro-argument is false,
misleading, or inconsistent because of the Federal Judge
in my case said I had standing to sue the County because I
paid the tax, but my claims weren't federal so she sent it
back to state court.

The ballot argument for the tax in the County contains
false statements.

"These laws respect the needs of medical patient and their
caregivers, as well as legitimate medical cannabis
businesses."

"State law, defining 'cannabis,' 'cannabis business,' and
'medical marijuana business' to be the same as that in
MMRSA"

"Will not change the current tax rate".

"Will not disadvantage low income patients".

Like measures statewide claiming legalization, as with
MMRSA, I am challenging the County of Santa Cruz tax on
state constitutional grounds, Article I "A statute or other
authority, shall be broadly construed if it furthers the
people's right of access, and narrowly construed if it limits
the right of access. A statute or other authority adopted
after the effective date of this subdivision that limits the
right of access shall be adopted with findings
demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and
the need for protecting that interest."

Argument against Measure E	Reply  Rebuttal to argument against Measure E
Proposition 215 the Compassionate Use Act of 1996 passed with 5,382,915 (55.6%) votes in favor and 4,301,960 (44.4%) against. Like other local and state measures claiming they are for legalization of marijuana, Measure E is a fraud to repeal rather than amending the Compassionate Use Act. The Compassionate Use Act does not include any of the words "Cannabis business" or "tax".  Proposition 215 said "the purposes of the Compassionate Use Act of 1996 are as follows, to ensure that patients and their primary caregivers who obtain and use marijuana for medical purposes upon the recommendation of a physician are not subject to criminal prosecution or sanction. To encourage the federal and state governments to implement a plan to provide for the safe and affordable distribution of marijuana to all patients in medical need of marijuana. The purposes of this section, 'primary caregiver' means the individual designated by the person exempted under this section who has consistently assumed responsibility for the housing, health, or safety of that person." Classifying "caregivers" as a "Cannabis business" stigmatizes patients' compassionate use.  I'm asking you as a taxpayer, voter, and as a medical marijuana patient who relies on this medicine for pain relief, please vote no on the amendment to the so-called Cannabis business tax because it discriminates against me personally and you too because the law says medical marijuana shouldn't be taxed just like any other prescription medicine you pick up at your pharmacy has no tax.	Measure E simply extends the Cannabis Business Tax, which currently only applies to dispensaries, to all cannabis-related businesses, such as cultivators.  It also aligns the definition of cannabis to conform to State law. Measure E does not repeal or amend the Compassionate Use Act.  It is well settled that cannabis is taxable. The production of cannabis comes with steep local costs such as the regulation of illegitimate operators and environmental damage which must be mitigated. The cost to protect our community and the environment should be borne by all cannabis-related businesses.  Measure E is supported unanimously by the Board of Supervisors and will help expand and maintain essential services for County residents.  Join us in voting YES ON MEASURE E.

Impartial analysis of Measure E

Dana McRae, County Counsel

By Jane M. Scott, Assistant County Counsel

If approved by a majority of those voting, this measure will amend three provisions of the existing Cannabis Business Tax
which applies to the unincorporated area of the County of Santa Cruz.

In 2014 the voters approved Measure K which enacted the ordinance entitled Cannabis Business Tax. It is codified as
Chapter 4.06 of the Santa Cruz County Code.

This measure would adopt an ordinance to amend the language defining "cannabis," "cannabis business," and "medical
marijuana business" for purposes of that tax. It would not change the tax rate nor the purposes for which the tax is
used.

This measure was placed on the ballot by the Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors.

A "yes" vote on Measure E is a vote to adopt the ordinance amending the Santa Cruz County Code.

A "no" vote on Measure E is a vote against adopting the ordinance.

Fiscal impact statement Measure E

Edith Driscoll, Auditor-Controller/Treasurer-Tax Collector

Measure E would authorize the County of Santa Cruz to amend Chapter 4.06 of the County Code and revise the
definitions of the terms 1) "cannabis" and 2) "cannabis business" or "medical marijuana business". This change will result
in all cannabis businesses such as cannabis cultivators, manufacturers, transporters and distributors in the
unincorporated areas of Santa Cruz County being subject to the Santa Cruz County Cannabis Business Tax.

Fiscal Effect

This amendment will expand the number of businesses subject to the tax which will result in additional tax revenue being
generated.

Use of the Funds

This amendment does not change the purposes for which the tax approved in 2014 may be used. These taxes are
considered General County Revenues which are deposited into the County General Fund and kept locally. The funds can
be spent on general governmental services currently supplied by the County such as public protection, health services,
parks and recreation and other county services.

Accountability

This amendment does not change the Auditor-Controller/Treasurer-Tax Collector's role as tax administrator with
authority to examine the books and records of cannabis businesses to verify the accuracy of their Cannabis Business Tax
reporting and to authorize assessments for unpaid taxes.

Impartial analysis of Measure J

Alan J. Smith, City Attorney

Article 3 of Chapter 6 of Title 3 of the Watsonville Municipal Code has levied a 10% transient occupancy tax since 1964
on each hotel or motel guest in the City. The City Council voted to approve the proposed tax but it can only go into effect
if it is also approved by a majority of voters at the November 2016 election. This ballot measure, if approved by City
voters, would increase that tax rate from 10% to 11% of the rent charged by the hotel or motel operator.

This transient occupancy tax is a general tax meaning that all tax revenue is deposited in the City's General Fund and is
available to pay for the costs of all City operations and programs including police and fire protection, parks and
recreation programs, economic and employment development, and other essential City services. This ballot measure
therefore proposes a "general purpose tax" rather than a "special purpose tax" and requires a simple majority vote for
adoption.

Since many of the City's hotel/motel guests are non-City residents who are tourists or City visitors, much of the
increased tax revenue generated by this measure, if adopted by the voters, would be paid by non-City residents.
Proceeds will underwrite the costs of providing municipal services to these visitors while here and to City residents.

A "Yes" vote will increase the tax from 10% to 11%. A "No" vote will leave the tax unchanged.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of the proposed transient occupancy tax increase ordinance.

Fiscal impact statement Measure J

Ezequiel Vega, Administrative Services Director

Measure J authorizes the City of Watsonville to increase the existing Transient Occupancy Tax (hotel tax) from 10% to
11%. Current tax proceeds are deposited in the General Fund and approval of this ordinance will not change that
practice. Funds generated by the tax will continue to be used to fund services such as public safety services to include
police and fire and community services offered by Parks and Community Services.

I estimate the approval of this tax measure will generate an additional eighty thousand annually. The tax rate cannot be
increased by action of the City Council without voter approval.

The projected revenues appear accurate based on my analysis of past transient occupancy revenues provided by City
staff. In this analysis, I relied on the best data available at this time; however, actual revenues may be more or less than
City staffs estimates due to increased or decreased activity in activities generating Transient Occupancy Tax due to
changes in the general economy.

EFFECTIVE DATE:

THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY OF WATSONVILLE, CALIFORNIA, DO HEREBY ORDAIN AS FOLLOWS:

SECTION 1. ENACTMENT.

Article 3 (Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax) of Chapter 6 (Taxation) of Title 3 (Finance) of the Watsonville Municipal
Code is hereby amended by removing Article 3 (Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax) in its entirety and replacing with a
new Article 3 (Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax Law) to read in words and figures as follows:

Article 3. Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax Law

Sec. 3-6.301 Title.

This article shall be known as the "Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax Law" of the City.

Local ballot measure: J

Sec. 3-6.302 Definitions.

Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this section govern the construction of this article:

(a)	"Person" shall mean any individual, firm, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, association, social club,
fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or any
other group or combination acting as a unit.

(b)	"Transient Occupancy Facility" shall mean any temporary or permanent structure, motor home, mobile home,
modular building or out building or any portion thereof, which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy, by
transients for dwelling, lodging, or sleeping purposes and shall include any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, home,
residence, outbuilding, granny unit, accessory unit, duplex, triplex, fourplex, apartment, motel studio hotel, bachelor
hotel, lodging house, rooming house, dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or house trailer at a fixed location,
or other similar structure, or any portion thereof.

(c)	"Occupancy" shall mean the use or possession, or the right to the use or possession, of any room, or portion thereof,
in any transient occupancy facility for dwelling, lodging, or sleeping purposes for any time period.

(d)	"Transient" shall mean any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession,
permit, right of access, license, or other agreement for a period of thirty (30) consecutive calendar days or less, counting
portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a transient occupancy facility shall be
deemed to be a transient until the period of thirty (30) days has expired, unless there is an agreement in writing between
the operator and the occupant providing for a long period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is transient,
uninterrupted periods of time extending both before and after the effective date of this article may be considered.

(e)	"Rent" shall mean the consideration charged, whether received, for the occupancy of space in a transient occupancy
facility valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor, or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits,
property, and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever.

(f)	"Operator" shall mean the person who is the proprietor of the transient occupancy facility, whether in the capacity of
owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, trustee, receiver, or any other capacity including such
arrangements as "Airbnb" or similar. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing agent of any type
or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this
article and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this article by
either the principal or the managing agent, however, shall be considered to be compliance by both.

(g)	"Finance Director" shall mean the City Finance Director.

(h)	"Certificate" shall mean the transient occupancy registration certificate as described in WMC 3-6.306.

Sec. 3-6.303 Tax imposed.

For the privilege of occupancy in any transient occupancy facility, each transient shall be subject to and shall pay a tax in
the amount of eleven (11%) percent of the rent charged by the operator. Such tax shall constitute a debt owed by the
transient to the City which debt shall be extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the City. The transient shall
pay the tax to the operator of the transient occupancy facility at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in
installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the
transient's ceasing to occupy space in the transient occupancy facility. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the
operator of the transient occupancy facility, the City Finance Director may require that such tax shall be paid directly to
the City Finance Director.

Impartial analysis of Measure K

Alan J. Smith, City Attorney

This measure would amend Watsonville's Utility Users Tax ("UUT") ordinance to: (1) modernize the telecommunications
part of the UUT; (2) reduce tax rate on telecommunications from 6% to 5.5%; and (3) exempt seniors, low income persons
and the disabled from the energy portion of the tax.

Watsonville voters first approved the UUT in 1989. It has been amended from time to time since 1989. It was last
amended in 2001. The UUT is a general tax meaning that all tax revenue is deposited in the City's General Fund and is
available to pay for the costs of all City operations and programs including police and fire protection, parks and
recreation programs, economic and employment development, and other essential City services. This ballot measure
therefore proposes a "general purpose tax" rather than a "special purpose tax" and requires a simple majority vote for
adoption.

This measure would make three changes to the UUT.

First, the measure would modernize the telecommunication part of the UUT to reflect changes in federal law, account for
technological advances and changes and treat all technologies equally. In recent years, many cities have modernized the
telecommunications part of their UUT ordinances to respond to changes in federal law and to reflect the shift from
landline telephones to digital communication technologies such as wireless and voice over internet protocol (VOIP).
Federal law does not permit cities to tax internet access and this measure does not change this. Most wireless carriers
already include the telecommunications tax on users' bills.

Second, the measure would reduce the telecommunications tax rate from 6% to 5.5%, for all users.

Third, this measure would exempt three categories of low income energy customers: (1) those qualified under the
California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) Program; (2) seniors over 65 years of age who are head of household and

(3)	persons who meet the disability standards for the Social Security Administration's Supplemental Income Program for
the Aged, Blind and Disabled (Title XVI of the Social Security Act, as amended).

A "Yes" vote will modernize the telecommunications language, reduce the telecommunications tax rate from 6% to 5.5%
and exempt seniors, low income persons and the disabled from the energy portion of the UUT.

A "No" vote will leave the UUT unchanged.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of the proposed Utility Users' Tax ordinance.

Fiscal impact statement Measure K

Ezequiel Vega, Administrative Services Director

Measure K authorizes the City of Watsonville to reduce the existing utility user tax for telecommunications from 6% to
5.5%, modernizing the ordinance to include newer technology, and exempts seniors, disabled and low income individuals
from energy taxes. Current tax proceeds are deposited in the General Fund and approval of this ordinance will not
change that practice. Funds generated by the tax will continue to be used to fund services such as public safety services
to include police and fire and community services offered by Parks and Community Services.

I estimate the approval of this tax measure will generate an additional Six Hundred Thousand annually. The tax rate
cannot be increased by action of the City Council without voter approval.

Based on my analysis of past utility tax revenues provided by City staff, the projected revenues appear accurate. In this
analysis, I relied on the best data available at this time; however, actual revenues may be more or less than City staff's
estimates due to increased or decreased activity in activities generating utility user tax due to changes in the general
economy.

Sec. 3-6.903 Constitutional and Statutory Exemptions.

(a)	The taxes imposed by this Article 9 shall not apply to:

(l)	Any person or service if imposition of such tax upon that person or service would be in violation of a Federal or State
statute or the Constitution of the State of California, or the Constitution of the United States; or

(2)	The City, and the State of California and its subdivisions.

(3)	Low Income Exemption. A residential service user shall be exempt from the gas and electric tax of this chapter if he
or she is qualified and is enrolled in Pacific Gas & Electric Company's (PG&E) CARE Program ("California Alternate Rates
for Energy" program). Individuals receiving the exemption granted by this subsection must reside at the location
receiving the service; the exemption shall not apply to any nonresidential service location.

(4)	Senior/Disabled Exemptions. A residential service user who is sixty-five (65) years old or older and is the head of the
household; or any residential service user who meets the criteria of disability as established by the Social Security
Administration's Supplemental Income Program for the Aged, Blind and Disabled (Title XVI of the Social Security Act, as
amended), shall be exempt from the gas and electric tax of this chapter.

(b)	Any service user that is exempt from the tax imposed by this Article 9 pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section shall
file an application with the Tax Administrator for an exemption; provided, however, this requirement shall not apply to a
service user that is a State or Federal agency or subdivision with a commonly recognized name for such service. Said
application shall be made upon a form approved by the Tax Administrator and shall state those facts, declared under
penalty of perjury, which qualify the applicant for an exemption, and shall include the names of all service suppliers
serving that service user. If deemed exempt by the Tax Administrator, such service user shall give the Tax Administrator
timely written notice of any change in service suppliers so that the Tax Administrator can properly notify the new service
supplier of the service user's tax exempt status. A service user that fails to apply and obtain an exemption pursuant to
this Section 3-6.903 shall not be entitled to a refund of a users tax collected and remitted to the Tax Administrator from
such service user as a result of such noncompliance.

(c)	The decision of the Tax Administrator regarding an exemption application may be appealed pursuant to Section 3-

by law. There is a rebuttable presumption that telecommunication services, which are billed to a billing or service
address in the City, are used, in whole or in part, within the City's boundaries, and such services are subject to taxation
under this section. There is also a rebuttable presumption that prepaid telecommunication services sold within the city
are primarily used, in whole or in part, within the City and are therefore subject to taxation under this Section. If the
billing address of the service user is different from the service address, the service address of the service user shall be
used for purposes of imposing the tax. As used in this section, the term "charges" shall include the value of any other
services, credits, property of every kind or nature, or other consideration provided by the service user in exchange for the
telecommunication services.

(b)	"Mobile telecommunications service" shall be sourced in accordance with the sourcing rules set forth in the Mobile
Telecommunications Sourcing Act (4 U.S.C. Section 124). The Tax Administrator may issue and disseminate to
telecommunication service suppliers, which are subject to the tax collection requirements of this section, sourcing rules
for the taxation of other telecommunication services, including but not limited to post-paid telecommunication services,
prepaid telecommunication services, and private telecommunication services, provided that such rules are based upon
custom and common practice that further administrative efficiency and minimize multi-jurisdictional taxation.

(c)	The Tax Administrator may issue and disseminate to telecommunication service suppliers, which are subject to the tax
collection requirements of this section, an administrative ruling identifying those telecommunication services, or charges
therefore, that are subject to the tax of paragraph (a) above. This administrative ruling shall not impose a new tax, revise
an existing tax methodology as stated in this section, or increase an existing tax, except as allowed by California

services; late payment fees; detailed billing; central office and custom calling features (including but not limited to call
waiting, call forwarding, caller identification and three-way calling); voice mail and other messaging services; directory
assistance; access and line charges; universal service charges; fees, charges or surcharges, imposed by any state or
federal agency or law (whether such charges or surcharges are imposed on the service supplier or the customer); local
number portability charges; and text and instant messaging. "Telecommunication services" shall not include digital
downloads that are not "ancillary telecommunication services," such as music, ringtones, games, and similar digital
products.

(e)	To prevent actual multi-jurisdictional taxation of telecommunication services subject to tax under this section, any
service user, upon proof to the Tax Administrator that the service user has previously paid the same tax in another state
or city on such telecommunication services, shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed to the extent of the

imposed by this subsection shall be at the rate of five and one-half percent (5.5%) of the charges made for such services,
and shall be collected from the service user by the video service supplier or its billing agent. There is a rebuttable
presumption that video services, which are billed to a billing or service address in the City, are used, in whole or in part,
within the City's boundaries, and such services are subject to taxation under this Article. If the billing address of the
service user is different from the service address, the service address of the service user shall be used for purposes of
imposing the tax.

(b)	As used in this section, the term "charges" shall include, but is not limited to, charges for the following:

(1)	fees, charges or surcharges imposed by any state or federal agency or law; including franchise fees and access fees
(PEG): whether such fees, charges or surcharges are imposed on the service supplier or the customer;

(2)	initial installation of equipment necessary for provision and receipt of video services;

subject to or not subject to the tax of subsection (a) above.

(e)	The tax imposed by this section shall be collected from the service user by the video service supplier, its billing agent,
or a reseller of such services. In the case of video service, the service user shall be deemed to be the purchaser of the
bulk video service (e.g., an apartment owner), unless such service is resold to individual users, in which case the service
user shall be the ultimate purchaser of the video service. The amount of tax collected in one (1) month shall be remitted
to the Tax Administrator, and must be received by the Tax Administrator on or before the twentieth (20th) day of the
following month.

Sec. 3-6.906 Electricity Users Tax.

(a)	There is hereby imposed a tax upon every person using electricity in the City. The tax imposed by this Section shall be

associated activities directly related to and/or necessary for the provision of electricity to the service user, which are
provided by a service supplier or non-utility service supplier to a service user. The tax shall be collected from the service
user by the service supplier or non-utility service supplier, or its billing agent.

and monthly charges, and other charges, fees and surcharges which are necessary to or common for the receipt, use and
enjoyment of electric service; and

provision of such electricity.

(d)	The Tax Administrator, from time to time, may survey the electric service suppliers to identify the various unbundled
billing components of electric retail service that they commonly provide to residential and commercial/industrial
customers in the City, and the charges therefor, including those items that are mandated by State or Federal regulatory
agencies as a condition of providing such electric service. The Tax Administrator, thereafter, may issue and disseminate
to such electric service providers an administrative ruling identifying those components and items which are: (i)
necessary or common to the receipt, use or enjoyment of electric service; or, (ii) currently, or historically have been,
included in a single or bundled rate for electric service by a local distribution company to a class of retail customers.

electricity by an electric public utility or governmental agency at a point within the City for resale.

(f)	The tax on electricity provided by self-production or by a non-utility service supplier not under the jurisdiction of this
Article 9 shall be collected and remitted in the manner set forth in Section 3-6.908 hereof. All other taxes on charges for
electricity imposed by this Section shall be collected from the service user by the electric service supplier or its billing
agent. The amount of tax collected in one (1) month shall be remitted to the Tax Administrator, and must be received by
the Tax Administrator on or before the twentieth (20th) day of the following month; or, at the option of the person
required to collect and/or remit the tax, such person shall remit an estimated amount of tax measured by the tax billed
in the previous month or upon the payment pattern of the service user, which must be received by the Tax Administrator

charges made for such gas, including all services related to the storage, transportation and delivery of such gas. The tax
shall be collected from the service user by the service supplier or non-utility service supplier, or its billing agent, and
shall apply to all uses of gas, including but not limited to, heating, electric generation by a non-public utility, and the use
of gas as a component of a manufactured product.

(b)	As used in this Section, the term "charges" shall apply to all services, components and items for gas service that are: i)
necessary or common to the receipt, use and enjoyment of gas service; or, ii) currently, or historically have been,
included in a single or bundled rate for gas service by a local distribution company to a class of retail customers. The

stored gas is ultimately used; but it shall be the obligation of the service user to self-collect the amount of tax not
applied to any charge for gas storage by the service supplier and to remit the tax to the appropriate jurisdiction;

Capacity or demand charges, late charges, service establishment or reestablishment charges, termination or early

billing components of gas retail service that they commonly provide to residential and commercial/industrial customers
in the City, and the charges therefor, including those items that are mandated by State or Federal regulatory agencies as
a condition of providing such gas service. The Tax Administrator, thereafter, may issue and disseminate to such gas
service suppliers an administrative ruling identifying those components and items which are: (i) necessary or common to
the receipt, use or enjoyment of gas service; or, (ii) currently, or historically have been, included in a single or bundled
rate for gas service by a local distribution company to a class of retail customers. Charges for such components and

amount of tax collected in one (1) month shall be remitted to the Tax Administrator, and must be received by the Tax
Administrator on or before the twentieth (20th) day of the following month; or, at the option of the person required to

or request for credit, as appropriate, within sixty (60) days following each calendar quarter. The credit, if approved by the

Sec. 3-6.908 Collection of Tax From Service Users Receiving Direct Purchase of Gas or Electricity.

(a)	Any service user subject to the tax imposed by Sections 3-6.906 or 3-6.907 hereof, which produces gas or electricity
for self-use; which receives gas or electricity, including any related supplemental services, directly from a non-utility
service supplier not under the jurisdiction of this Article 9; or which, for any other reason, is not having the full tax
collected and remitted by its service supplier, a non-utility service supplier, or its billing agent on the use of gas or
electricity in the City, including any related supplemental services, shall report said fact to the Tax Administrator and
shall remit the tax due directly to the Tax Administrator within thirty (30) days of such use. In lieu of paying said actual
tax, the service user may, at its option, remit to the Tax Administrator within thirty (30) days for such use an estimated
amount of tax measured by the tax billed in the previous month, or upon the payment pattern of similar customers of the
service supplier using similar amounts of gas or electricity, provided that the service user shall submit an adjusted
payment or request for credit, as appropriate, within sixty (60) days following each calendar quarter. The credit, if
approved by the Tax Administrator, may be applied against any subsequent tax bill that becomes due.

(b)	The Tax Administrator may require said service user to identify its nonutility service supplier and provide, subject to
audit, invoices, books of account, or other satisfactory evidence documenting the quantity of gas or electricity used,
including any related supplemental services, and the cost or price thereof. If the service user is unable to provide such
satisfactory evidence, or, if the administrative cost of calculating the tax in the opinion of the Tax Administrator is
excessive, the Tax Administrator may determine the tax by applying the tax rate to the equivalent charges the service
user would have incurred if the gas or electricity used, including any related supplemental services, had been provided
by the service supplier that is the primary supplier of gas or electricity within the City.

(c)	If the service user or its agent produces electricity for self-use and fails to meter the amount of electricity used by the
service user, or fails to meter the amount of electricity that is taken against electricity provided by a service supplier (e.g.,
net-metering), the Tax Administrator may, for purposes of calculating the tax hereunder, estimate the amount of
electricity that is self-produced based on the manufacturer's estimate of annual electricity generation for the facility
used by the service user to generate electricity.

Sec. 3-6.909 Nonresidential rebate (Gas and Electricity).

Except as otherwise provided herein, any non-residential service user, other than an electrical corporation or gas
corporation, with combined electric and gas taxes of more than the amount established by resolution of the Council but

Local ballot measure: K

not to exceed Nine Thousand Nine Hundred and no/lOOths ($9,900.00) Dollars, which amount shall be annually adjusted
each fiscal year to reflect the Consumer Price Index (CPI), shall receive a rebate from taxes collected in excess of the
amount established by resolution of the Council during a fiscal year for such use. Rebates shall be made monthly.
Businesses eligible for the decreased tax described above shall advise the City of any rebate due by submitting a copy of
each month's electric and gas bills to the City Finance Director.

Sec. 3-6.910 Water Users' Tax.

(a)	There is imposed a tax upon every person using water in the City which is transported and delivered through a
pipeline distribution system. The tax imposed by this section shall be at the rate of six percent (6%) of the charges made
for such water.

(b)	As used in this section, the term "charges" shall apply to all services, components and items that are: i) necessary for
or common to the receipt, use or enjoyment of water service; or, ii) currently are or historically have been included in a
single or bundled rate for water service by a local distribution company to a class of retail customers. The term "charges'
shall include, but is not limited to, the following charges: water commodity charges (potable and non-potable);
distribution or transmission charges; metering charges; customer charges; fire protection services; late charges; service
establishment or reestablishment charges; franchise fees; franchise surcharges; annual and monthly charges; and other
charges, fees and surcharges which are necessary for or common to the receipt, use or enjoyment of water service; and,
charges, fees, or surcharges, which are mandated by any state or federal agency or law, or a water district, whether or
not such charges, fees, or surcharges appear on a bundled or line item basis on the customer billing.

(c)	As used in this section, the term "charges" shall include the value of any other services, credits, property of every kind
or nature, or other consideration provided by the service user in exchange for the water services.

(d)	The Tax Administrator, from time to time, may survey the water service suppliers in the City to identify the various
unbundled billing components of water retail service that they commonly provide to residential and
commercial/industrial customers in the City, and the charges therefor, including those items that are mandated by a
water district or a state or federal agency as a condition of providing such water service. The Tax Administrator,
thereafter, may issue and disseminate to such water service suppliers an administrative ruling identifying those
components and items which are: i) necessary for or common to the receipt, use or enjoyment of water service; or, ii)
currently are or historically have been included in a single or bundled rate for water service by a local distribution
company to a class of retail customers. Charges for such components and items shall be subject to the tax of subsection

(a)	above.

(e)	The tax on water service imposed by this section shall be collected from the service user by the water service supplier
or its billing agent. The amount of tax collected in one (1) month shall be remitted to the Tax Administrator, and must be
received by the Tax Administrator on or before the twentieth (20th) day of the following month.

Sec. 3-6.911 Effect of Commingling Taxable Items with Nontaxable Items.

If any non-taxable service charges are combined with and not separately stated from taxable service charges on the
customer bill or invoice of a service supplier, the combined charge is subject to tax unless the service supplier is able to
establish reasonable values for the portions of the combined charge that are nontaxable and taxable. If the service
supplier offers a combination of taxable and non-taxable services, and the charges are separately stated, the service
supplier shall assign reasonable values for the taxable and non-taxable services. In assigning reasonable values for
taxable and non-taxable services under this Section 3-6.911, the service supplier may use reasonable and verifiable
standards, as approved by the Tax Administrator, such as: i) the books and records kept in the regular course of business
and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (not created and maintained for tax purposes): ii) the
market value of such taxable and non-taxable services when offered on a stand-alone basis by the supplier or its
competitors; or iii) other similar evidence of value. The service supplier has the burden of proving to the satisfaction of
the Tax Administrator the proper valuation and apportionment of taxable and non-taxable charges under this Section 3-
6.911.

Sec. 3-6.912 Substantial Nexus/Minimum Contacts

For purposes of imposing a tax or establishing a duty to collect and remit a tax under this Article, "substantial nexus",
"substantial economic presence", and "minimum contacts" shall be construed broadly in favor of the imposition,
collection and/or remittance of the utility users tax to the fullest extent permitted by State and Federal law, and as it
may change from time to time by judicial interpretation or by statutory enactment. Any telecommunication service
(including VoIP) used by a person with a service address in the City, which service is capable of terminating a call to
another person on the general telephone network, shall be subject to a rebuttable presumption that "substantial
nexus/minimum contacts" exists for purposes of imposing a tax, or establishing a duty to collect and remit a tax, under
this Article. A service supplier shall be deemed to have sufficient activity in the City for tax collection and remittance
purposes if its activities include, but are not limited to, any of the following: maintains or has within the City, directly or

Local ballot measure: K

through an agent, affiliate or subsidiary, a place of business of any nature; solicits business in the City by employees,
independent contractors, resellers, agents, affiliates or other representatives; solicits business in the City on a
continuous, regular, seasonal or systematic basis by means of advertising that is broadcast or relayed from a transmitter
within the City or distributed from a location within the City; or advertises in newspapers or other periodicals printed and
published within the City or through materials distributed in the City by means other than the United States mail; or if
there are activities performed in the City on behalf of the service supplier that are significantly associated with the
service supplier's ability to establish and maintain a market in the City for the provision of utility services that are subject
to a tax under this Article (e.g., an affiliated person engaging in activities in the City that inure to the benefit of the
service supplier in its development or maintenance of a market for its services in the City).

Sec. 3-6.913 Duty to Collect; Procedures.

(a)	Collection by Service Suppliers. The duty of service suppliers to collect and remit the taxes imposed by the provisions
of this Article 9 shall be performed as follows:

(1)	The tax shall be collected by service suppliers insofar as practicable at the same time as, and along with, the
collection of the charges made in accordance with the regular billing practice of the service supplier. Where the amount
paid by a service user to a service supplier is less than the full amount of the charge and tax that was accrued for the
billing period, a proportionate share of both the charge and the tax shall be deemed to have been paid. In those cases
where a service user has notified the service supplier of refusal to pay the tax imposed on said charges, Section 3-6.916
shall apply.

(2)	The duty of a service supplier to collect the tax from a service user shall commence with the beginning of the first
regular billing period applicable to the service user where all charges normally included in such regular billing are
subject to the provisions of this Article 9. Where a person receives more than one (1) billing, one (1) or more being for
different periods than another, the duty to collect shall arise separately for each billing period.

(b)	Filing Return and Payment. Each person required by this Article 9 to remit a tax shall file a return to the Tax
Administrator, on forms approved by the Tax Administrator, on or before the due date. The full amount of the tax
collected shall be included with the return and filed with the Tax Administrator. The Tax Administrator is authorized to
require such additional information as he or she deems necessary to determine if the tax is being levied, collected, and
remitted in accordance with this Chapter 3-6.900. Returns are due immediately upon cessation of business for any
reason. Pursuant to Revenue and Tax Code Section 7284.6, the Tax Administrator, and its agents, shall maintain such
filing returns as confidential information that is exempt from the disclosure provisions of the Public Records Act.

Sec. 3-6.914 Collection Penalties; Service Suppliers or Self-Collectors.

(a)	Taxes collected from a service user, or owed by a service user subject to Section 3-6.908 hereof, are delinquent if not
received by the Tax Administrator on or before the due date. Should the due date occur on a weekend or legal holiday,
the return must be received by the Tax Administrator on the first regular working day following the weekend or legal
holiday. A direct deposit, including electronic fund transfers and other similar methods of electronically exchanging
monies between financial accounts, made by a service supplier in satisfaction of its obligations under this Section shall
be considered timely if the transfer is initiated on or before the due date, and the transfer settles into the City's account
on the following business day.

(b)	If the person required to collect and/or remit the utility users tax fails to collect the tax (by failing to properly assess
the tax on one (1) or more services or charges on the customer's billing) or fails to remit the tax collected on or before
the due date, or, in the case of a service user that fails to properly self-collect and remit the tax under Section 3-6.908
hereof on or before the due date, the Tax Administrator shall attach a penalty for such delinquencies or deficiencies at
the rate of fifteen (15%) percent of the total tax that is delinquent or deficient in the remittance, and shall pay interest at
the rate of and 75/100ths (0.75%) percent per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of
penalties, from the date on which the remittance first becomes delinquent, until paid.

(c)	The Tax Administrator shall have the power to impose additional penalties upon persons required to collect and remit
taxes pursuant to the provisions of this Article 9 for fraud or gross negligence in reporting or remitting at the rate of
fifteen (15%) percent of the amount of the tax collected and/or required to be remitted, or as recomputed by the Tax
Administrator.

(d)	For collection purposes only, every penalty imposed and such interest that is accrued under the provisions of this
section shall become a part of the tax herein required to be paid.

(e)	Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Tax Administrator may, in his or her discretion, modify the due dates and/or
penalty and interest provisions of this section to be consistent with any uniform standards or procedures that are
mutually agreed upon by UUT public agencies, or otherwise legally established, to create a UUT central payment location
or mechanism.

Sec. 3-6.915 Deficiency Determination and Assessment; Tax Application Errors.

(a)	The Tax Administrator shall make a deficiency determination if he or she determines that any person required to pay
or collect taxes pursuant to the provisions of this Article 9 has failed to pay, collect, and/or remit the proper amount of
tax by improperly applying or failing to apply the tax to one or more taxable services or charges. Nothing herein shall
require that the Tax Administrator institute proceedings under this Section 3-6.915 if, in the opinion of the Tax
Administrator, the cost of collection or enforcement likely outweighs the tax benefit.

(b)	The Tax Administrator shall mail a notice of such deficiency determination to the person required to pay or remit the
tax, which notice shall refer briefly to the amount of the taxes owed, plus interest at the rate of seventy-five one-
hundredths percent (0.75%) per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax from the date on which the tax
should have been received by the City. Within fourteen (14) calendar days after the date of service of such notice, the
person may send a request in writing to the Tax Administrator asking for a hearing on the matter.

(c)	If the person fails to request a hearing within the prescribed time period, the amount of the deficiency determination
shall become a final assessment, and shall immediately be due and owing to the City. If the person requests a hearing,
the Tax Administrator shall cause the matter to be set for hearing, which shall be scheduled within thirty (30) days after
receipt of the written request for hearing. Notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be mailed by the Tax
Administrator to such person at least ten (10) calendar days prior to the hearing, and, if the Tax Administrator desires
said person to produce specific records at such hearing, such notice may designate the records requested to be
produced.

(d)	At the time fixed for the hearing, the Tax Administrator shall hear all relevant testimony and evidence, including that
of any other interested parties. At the discretion of the Tax Administrator, the hearing may be continued from time to
time for the purpose of allowing the presentation of additional evidence. Within a reasonable time following the
conclusion of the hearing, the Tax Administrator shall issue a final assessment (or non-assessment), thereafter, by
confirming, modifying or rejecting the original deficiency determination, and shall mail a copy of such final assessment
to person owing the tax. The decision of the Tax Administrator may be appealed pursuant to Section 3-6.921. Filing an
application with the Tax Administrator and appeal to the City Manager, or designee, pursuant to Section 3-6.921 is a
prerequisite to a suit thereon.

(e)	Payment of the final assessment shall become delinquent if not received by the Tax Administrator on or before the
thirtieth (30th) day following the date of receipt of the notice of final assessment. The penalty for delinquency shall be
fifteen percent (15%) on the total amount of the assessment, along with interest at the rate of seventy-five one-
hundredths percent (0.75%) per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the
date of delinquency, until paid. The applicable statute of limitations regarding a claim by the City seeking payment of a
tax assessed under this Article 9 shall commence from the date of delinquency as provided in this subsection (e).

(f)	All notices under this Article 9 may be sent by regular mail, postage prepaid, and shall be deemed received on the
third calendar day following the date of mailing, as established by a proof of mailing.

Sec. 3-6.916 Administrative Remedy; Non-paying Service Users.

(a)	Whenever the Tax Administrator determines that a service user has deliberately withheld the amount of the tax owed
by the service user from the amounts remitted to a person required to collect the tax, or whenever the Tax Administrator
deems it in the best interest of the City, he or she may relieve such person of the obligation to collect the taxes due
under this Section 3-6.916 from certain named service users for specific billing periods. Whenever the service user has
failed to pay the amount of tax owed for a period of two (2) or more billing periods, the service supplier shall be relieved
of the obligation to collect taxes due. The service supplier shall provide the City with the names and addresses of such
service users and the amounts of taxes owed under the provisions of this Section 3-6.916. Nothing herein shall require
that the Tax Administrator institute proceedings under this Section 3-6.916 if, in the opinion of the Tax Administrator, the
cost of collection or enforcement likely outweighs the tax benefit.

(b)	In addition to the tax owed, the service user shall pay a delinquency penalty at the rate of fifteen (15%) percent of the
total tax that is owed, and shall pay interest at the rate of three-quarters of one (3/4%) percent per month, or any
fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the due date, until paid.

(c)	The Tax Administrator shall notify the nonpaying service user that the Tax Administrator has assumed the
responsibility to collect the taxes due for the stated periods and demand payment of such taxes, including penalties and
interest. The notice shall be served on the service user by personal delivery or by deposit of the notice in the United
States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the service user at the address to which billing was made by the person
required to collect the tax; or, should the service user have a change of address, to his or her last known address.

(d)	If the service user fails to remit the tax to the Tax Administrator within thirty (30) days from the date of the service of
the notice upon him or her, the Tax Administrator may impose an additional penalty of fifteen (15%) percent of the
amount of the total tax that is owed.

Local ballot measure: K

Sec. 3-6.917 Actions to Collect.

Any tax required to be paid by a service user under the provisions of this Article 9 shall be deemed a debt owed by the
service user to the City. Any such tax collected from a service user which has not been remitted to the Tax Administrator
shall be deemed a debt owed to the City by the person required to collect and remit and shall no longer be a debt of the
service user. Any person owing money to the City under the provisions of this Article 9 shall be liable in an action
brought in the name of the City for the recovery of such amount, including penalties and interest as provided for in this
Article 9, along with any collection costs incurred by the City as a result of the person's noncompliance with this Article 9,
including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney's fees. In the event that a service user or service supplier owing a tax
under this Article 9 files bankruptcy, then such debt to the City shall be deemed an unsecured priority excise tax
obligation under 11 U.S.C.A. Section 507(a)(8)(C). Service suppliers who seek to collect charges for service in bankruptcy
proceedings shall also include in any such claim the amount of taxes due the City for those services, unless the Tax
Administrator determines that such duty is in conflict with any federal or state law, rule, or regulation or that such action
would be administratively impractical.

Sec. 3-6.918 Additional Powers and Duties of the Tax Administrator.

(a)	The Tax Administrator shall have the power and duty, and is hereby directed, to enforce each and all of the provisions
of this Article 9.

(b)	The Tax Administrator may adopt administrative rules and regulations consistent with provisions of this Article 9 for
the purpose of interpreting, clarifying, carrying out and enforcing the payment, collection and remittance of the taxes
herein imposed. The administrative ruling shall not impose a new tax, revise an existing tax methodology as stated in this
Article 9, or increase an existing tax, except as allowed by Californio Government Code Section 53750(h)(2). A copy of
such administrative rules and regulations shall be on file in the Tax Administrator's office. To the extent that the Tax
Administrator determines that the tax imposed under this Article 9 shall not be collected in full for any period of time
from any particular service supplier or service user, that determination shall be considered an exercise of the Tax
Administrator's discretion to settle disputes and shall not constitute a change in taxing methodology for purposes of
Government Code Section 53750 or otherwise. The Tax Administrator is not authorized to amend the City's methodology
for purposes of Government Code Section 53750 and the City does not waive or abrogate its ability to impose the utility
users tax in full as a result of promulgating administrative rulings or entering into agreements.

(c)	Upon a proper showing of good cause, the Tax Administrator may make administrative agreements, with appropriate
conditions, to vary from the strict requirements of this Article 9 and thereby; (1) conform to the billing procedures of a
particular service supplier (or service user subject to Section 3-6.908 hereof) so long as said agreements result in the
collection of the tax in conformance with the general purpose and scope of this Article 9; or, (2) to avoid a hardship
where the administrative costs of collection and remittance greatly outweigh the tax benefit. A copy of each such
agreement shall be on file in the Tax Administrator's office, and are voidable by the Tax Administrator or the City at any
time.

(d)	The Tax Administrator may conduct an audit, to ensure proper compliance with the requirements of this Article 9, of
any person required to collect and/or remit a tax pursuant to this Article 9. The Tax Administrator shall notify said
person of the initiation of an audit in writing. In the absence of fraud or other intentional misconduct, the audit period or
review shall not exceed a period of three (3) years next preceding the date of receipt of the written notice by said person
from the Tax Administrator. Upon completion of the audit, the Tax Administrator may make a deficiency determination
pursuant to Section 3-6.915 for all taxes (and applicable penalties and interest) owed and not paid, as evidenced by
information provided by such person to the Tax Administrator. If said person is unable or unwilling to provide sufficient
records to enable the Tax Administrator to verify compliance with this Article 9, the Tax Administrator is authorized to
make a reasonable estimate of the deficiency. Said reasonable estimate shall be entitled to a rebuttable presumption of
correctness.

(e)	Upon receipt of a written request of a taxpayer, and for good cause, the Tax Administrator may extend the time for
filing any statement required pursuant to this Article 9 for a period of not to exceed forty-five (45) days, provided that
the time for filing the required statement has not already passed when the request is received. No penalty for delinquent
payment shall accrue by reason of such extension. Interest shall accrue during said extension at the rate of three-
quarters of one (3/4%) percent per month, prorated for any portion thereof.

(f)	The Tax Administrator shall determine the eligibility of any person who asserts a right to exemption from, or a refund
of, the tax imposed by this Article 9.

(g)	The Tax Administrator, with the written approval of the City Attorney, may compromise a claim pursuant to this Article
9 where the portion of the claim proposed to be released is equal to or less than four thousand nine hundred ninety-nine
($4,999.00) dollars; and, with the approval of the City Attorney and the City Council, may compromise such a claim where
the portion proposed to be released is greater than four thousand nine hundred ninety-nine ($4,999.00) dollars.

Local ballot measure: K

(h)	Notwithstanding any provision in this Article 9 to the contrary, the Tax Administrator may waive any penalty or
interest imposed upon a person required to collect and/or remit for failure to collect the tax imposed by this Article 9 if,
in the opinion of the Tax Administrator, the non-collection occurred in good faith. In determining whether the non-
collection was in good faith, the Tax Administrator may take into consideration the uniqueness of the product or service,
industry practice or other precedence, or whether the person offers to voluntarily disclose its tax liability. To encourage
voluntary full disclosure and on-going cooperation on tax collection and remittance, the Tax Administrator, and its
agents, may enter into agreements with the tax-collecting service providers and grant prospective only effect on any
changes regarding the taxation of services or charges that were previously deemed by the service provider, in good faith
and without gross negligence, to be non-taxable. In determining whether the non-collection was in good faith and
without gross negligence, the Tax Administrator may take into consideration the uniqueness of the product or service,
industry practice or other precedence, and whether the disclosure was voluntarily made by the service provider or its
agent.

Sec. 3-6.919 Records.

(a)	It shall be the duty of every person required to collect and/or remit to the City any tax imposed by this Article 9 to
keep and preserve, for a period of at least three (3) years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of
such tax that such person may have been liable for the collection of and remittance to the Tax Administrator, which
records the Tax Administrator shall have the right to inspect at a reasonable time.

(b)	The Tax Administrator may issue an administrative subpoena to compel a person to deliver, to the Tax Administrator,
copies of all records deemed necessary by the Tax Administrator to establish compliance with this Article 9, including
the delivery of records in a common electronic format on readily available media if such records are kept electronically
by the person in the usual and ordinary course of business. As an alternative to delivering the subpoenaed records to the
Tax Administrator on or before the due date provided in the administrative subpoena, such person may provide access to
such records outside the City on or before the due date, provided that such person shall reimburse the City for all
reasonable travel expenses incurred by the City to inspect those records, including travel, lodging, meals, and other
similar expenses, but excluding the normal salary or hourly wages of those persons designated by the City to conduct
the inspection.

(c)	The Tax Administrator is authorized to execute a nondisclosure agreement approved by the City Attorney to protect
the confidentiality of customer information pursuant to California Revenue and Tax Code Sections 7284.6 and 7284.7.
The Tax Administrator may request from a person providing transportation or distribution services of gas or electricity to
service users within the City, a list of the names, billing and service addresses, quantities of gas or electricity delivered,
and other pertinent information, of its transportation customers within the City pursuant to Section 6354(e) of the
California Public Utilities Code.

(d)	If a service supplier uses a billing agent or billing aggregator to bill, collect, and/or remit the tax, the service supplier
shall: (1) provide to the Tax Administrator the name, address and telephone number of each billing agent and billing
aggregator currently authorized by the service supplier to bill, collect, and/or remit the tax to the City; and, (2) upon
request of the Tax Administrator, deliver, or effect the delivery of, any information or records in the possession of such
billing agent or billing aggregator that, in the opinion of the Tax Administrator, is necessary to verify the proper
application, calculation, collection and/or remittance of such tax to the City .

(e)	If any person subject to record-keeping under this Article 9 unreasonably denies the Tax Administrator, or the Tax
Administrator's designated representative, access to such records, or fails to produce the information requested in an
administrative subpoena within the time specified, the Tax Administrator may impose a penalty of five hundred ($500.00)
dollars on such person for each day following: i) the initial date that the person refuses to provide such access; or, ii) the
due date for production of records as set forth in the administrative subpoena. This penalty shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this Article 9.

Sec. 3-6.920 Refunds/Credits.

Whenever the amount of any tax has been overpaid or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally
collected or received by the Tax Administrator under this Article 9, it may be refunded or credited as provided in this
Section:

(a) The Tax Administrator may refund any tax that has been overpaid or paid more than once or has been erroneously or
illegally collected or received by the Tax Administrator under this Article 9, provided that no refund shall be paid under
the provisions of this section unless the claimant or his or her guardian, conservator, executor, or administrator has
submitted a written claim to the Tax Administrator within one (1) year of the overpayment or erroneous or illegal
collection of said tax. Such claim must clearly establish claimant's right to the refund by written records showing
entitlement thereto. To the extent allowed by law, nothing herein shall permit the filing of a claim on behalf of a class or

Local ballot measure: K

group of taxpayers unless each member of the class has submitted a written claim under penalty of perjury as provided
by this Section 3-6.920.

(b)	The submission of a written claim, which is acted upon by the City Council, shall be a prerequisite to a suit thereon.
(See Section 935 of the Californio Government Code). The Tax Administrator, or the City Council where the claim is in
excess of four thousand nine hundred ninety-five ($4,995.00) dollars shall act upon the refund claim within the time
period set forth in Government Code Section 912.4. If the City Council fails or refuses to act on a refund claim within the
time prescribed by Government Section 912.4, the claim shall be deemed to have been rejected by the City Council on
the last day of the period within which the City Council was required to act upon the claim as provided in Government
Code Section 912.4. The Tax Administrator shall give notice of the action in a form that substantially complies with that
set forth in Government Code Section 913.

(c)	Notwithstanding the notice provisions of subsection (a) of this Section 3-6.920, the Tax Administrator may, at his or
her discretion, give written permission to a service supplier, who has collected and remitted any amount of tax in excess
of the amount of tax imposed by this Article 9, to claim credit for such overpayment against the amount of tax which is
due the City upon a subsequent monthly return(s) to the Tax Administrator, provided that, prior to taking such credit by
the service supplier: 1) such credit is claimed in a return dated no later than one year from the date of overpayment or
erroneous collection of said tax; 2) the Tax Administrator is satisfied that the underlying basis and amount of such credit
has been reasonably established; and, 3) in the case of an overpayment by a service user to the service supplier that has
been remitted to the City, the Tax Administrator has received proof, to his or her satisfaction, that the overpayment has
been refunded by the service supplier to the service user in an amount equal to the requested credit.

Sec. 3-6.921 Appeals.

action on behalf of a class or group of taxpayers.

hereof), deficiency determination, assessment, or administrative ruling of the Tax Administrator; he or she may appeal to

enforcing the provisions of this Section 3-6.923.

Sec. 3-6.924 Notice of Changes to Ordinance.

If a tax under this Article 9 is added, repealed, increased, reduced, or the tax base is changed, the Tax Administrator shall
follow the notice requirements of Public Utilities Code Section 799.

Sec. 3-6.925 Future Amendment to Cited Statute.

Unless specifically provided otherwise, any reference to a State or Federal statute in this Article 9 shall mean such

Sec. 3-6.927 No Increase in Tax Percentage or Change in Methodology Without Voter Approval; Amendment or
Repeal.

This Article 9 of the Watsonville Municipal Code may be repealed or amended by the City Council without a vote of the
People. However, as required by Chapter XIIIC of the California Constitution, voter approval is required for any
amendment provision that would increase the rate of any tax levied pursuant to this Ordinance, provided however, the
following actions shall not constitute an increase of the rate of a tax:

(a)	The restoration of the rate of the tax to a rate that is no higher than that set by this Ordinance, if the City Council has
acted to reduce the rate of the tax;

(b)	An action that interprets or clarifies the methodology of the tax, or any definition applicable to the tax, so long as
such interpretation or clarification (even if contrary to some prior interpretation or clarification) is not inconsistent with
the language of this Ordinance;

exemption or exception (other than the discontinuation of an exemption or exception specifically set forth in this
Ordinance); and

this code, as it existed prior to its amendment as provided herein, with respect to any charge for a service shall be
deemed to have satisfied his or her obligation to pay the tax levied pursuant to this code as amended herein, with
respect to that charge. The intent of this paragraph is to prevent the imposition of multiple taxes upon a single utility
charge during the transition period from the prior Utility Users Tax code to the amended Utility Users Tax code (which
transition period ends April 1, 2017) and to permit service providers or other persons with an obligation to remit the tax
hereunder, during that transition period, to satisfy their collection obligations by collecting either tax.

SECTION 3. SEVERABILITY.

That if any section, subsection, subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this Article 9 or any part thereof is
for any reason held to be invalid, unlawful or unconstitutional, such decision, and the decision not to enforce such, shall
not affect the validity of the remaining portion of this Article 9 or any part thereof. The City Council hereby declares that
it would have passed each section, subsection, subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase thereof, irrespective of
the fact that any one or more sections, subsections, subdivisions, paragraphs, sentences, clauses or phrases be declared
invalid, unlawful or unconstitutional.

Arguments and replies are the opinions of the authors. We print them exactly as submitted, including errors.

Argument for Measure L

The City of Watsonville is moving forward in accordance to state regulations by drafting fair and balanced local laws by
which cannabis may be responsibly provided by prescription, without creating a public nuisance.

The existing cannabis ordinance attempts to balance the needs of medical patients, caregivers, and legitimate medical
cannabis businesses, with the need to protect our neighborhoods and community and act with respect for our
community.

This tax is paid by the cannabis businesses -- not patients, caregivers or those who purchase cannabis for personal use.
All revenue collected will stay local, to protect and maintain our neighborhoods, business districts, parks and open
spaces.

In recent years, the prolonged economic recession caused major reductions in city services. Measure L will provide new
revenue, which will be used for many general purposes, such as:

Police and Fire Service
Parks and Community Services
Community and Social Services
City Libraries
Community Development

Measure L creates a business tax only for cannabis businesses, not all businesses. It does not authorize new cannabis
dispensaries or businesses. Measure L is nearly identical to the proposed cannabis business tax passed in the
unincorporated county. Passage of the tax ensures consistent regulation across our region.

State law requires that any new tax must be approved by the voters. Measure L is supported unanimously by the City
Council, and will help support essential services to benefit our community.

Impartial analysis of Measure L

Alan J. Smith, City Attorney

This ballot measure, if adopted by the voters, would add an ordinance to the Watsonville Municipal Code imposing a
cannabis business tax on cannabis (marijuana) businesses which operate inside City limits. The ordinance authorizes the
City Council to set a maximum tax rate of no more than $20 per square foot per year of cultivated cannabis plant area, a
maximum tax rate of not more than two and one-half percent of gross receipts from the manufacture or processing of
cannabis, and a gross receipts tax of not more than ten percent of gross receipts from the sale of cannabis.

The ordinance defines "cannabis" and "business" together to include all conduct within the City relating to cannabis. All
cannabis business tax revenue will be deposited in the City's General Fund. General Fund revenue is used by the City to
pay for the provision of municipal services to City residents and visitors including the provision of essential City services.

Because the proposed cannabis business tax would be imposed for general municipal governmental purposes, the ballot
measure proposes a "general tax" as defined by Article XIII of the California Constitution. The City Council voted to
approve the proposed tax but it can only go into effect if it is also approved by a majority of voters at the November
2016 election.

Accompanying this measure is a non-binding advisory measure, asking voters for guidance on how the additional
revenue should be used if the voters approve the measure. In particular, voters are asked whether, if the measure passes,
their preference is that (i) 20% of its proceeds be used to pay for law enforcement and crime prevention services, (ii) 15%
to pay for fire services, (iii) 20% to pay for community development, (iv) 25% to pay for parks and community services, (v)
8% for the City libraries, and (vi) 12% for non-profit social and community services?

If the tax passes, the City Council may be guided by the voter's decision on the advisory question in deciding how to use
the revenue. Flowever, the City Council is not legally bound by the outcome of the vote on the advisory question. The
City Council can use the revenue collected as a result of the measure for any lawful City purpose. You can vote "Yes" on
the tax and "No" on the accompanying advisory measure.

For the ballot measure to be adopted, it must receive a simple majority "yes" vote, in other words, more than fifty
percent. A "Yes" vote approves the proposed cannabis business license tax. A "No" vote means there will be no cannabis
business license tax.

This ballot measure has been placed on the ballot by the Watsonville City Council.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of the proposed Cannabis Business Tax on Cannabis Businesses ordinance.

Fiscal impact statement Measure L

Ezequiel Vega, Administrative Services Director

Measure L authorizes the City of Watsonville to impose a Cannabis Business Tax not to exceed 10% on gross receipts
from retail sales of cannabis, 2.5% on gross receipts from the sales of cannabis, and $20 per square foot for grow area of
cannabis cultivation. Funds generated by the tax will be used to fund services such as public safety services to include
police and fire and community services offered by Parks and Community Services.

I estimate the approval of this tax measure will generate between $1.7 and $1.9 million if cannabis manufacturing,
processing, and dispensaries are all allowed in the future.

The projected revenues appear accurate based on my analysis on estimates. In this analysis I relied on the best data
available at this time; however, actual revenues may be more or less than City staff's estimates due to increased or
decreased activity in activities generating type of revenue due to changes of demand of the product and in the general
economy.

amount of business tax, if any, required to be paid by the provisions hereof, and for the purpose of verifying any
statements or any item thereof when filed by any person pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. If such person, after
written demand by the Finance Director, refuses to make available for audit, examination or verification such books,
records or equipment as the Finance Director requests, the Finance Director may, after full consideration of all

years thereafter as to any liability arising from engaging in such business whether or not a deficiency determination is
issued prior to the date the tax would otherwise be due. Whenever a deficiency determination is made, a notice shall be
given to the person concerned in the same manner as notices of assessment are given under §§ 3-6.1224 through 3^

voter approval of such amendment or interpretation, or to the extent that such change would result in a tax decrease. To
the extent voter approval would otherwise be required or a tax decrease would result, the prior version of the statute (or
interpretation) shall remain applicable; for any application or situation that would not require voter approval or result in
a decrease of a tax, provisions of the amended statute (or new interpretation) shall be applicable to the maximum
possible extent.

result of changes in State or Federal law, no amendment or modification of this chapter shall be required to conform the

Impartial analysis of Measure M

Alan J. Smith, City Attorney

This is an advisory measure placed on the ballot by the City Council. It relates to, but is separate from, the Cannabis
Business Tax Measure also on the ballot. The Cannabis Business Tax Measure would impose a tax on cannabis businesses
in the City of Watsonville. See the accompanying impartial analysis of that tax measure. The advisory measure is
analyzed in the next three paragraphs.

This advisory measure allows voters to say how the cannabis tax revenues should be used if the proposed tax is
approved. Specifically, this measure asks voters if the Cannabis Business Tax Measure is approved by the voters, shall (i)
20% of its proceeds be used only to pay for law enforcement and crime prevention services, (ii) 15% only to pay for fire
services, (iii) 20% only to pay for community development, (iv) 25% only to pay for parks and community services, (v) 8%
only for the City libraries, and (vi) 12% only for non-profit social and community services?

Because this measure is advisory, its passage would not legally require the City Council to spend the revenues as
described in the measure. Instead, this measure advises the Council how voters wish tax revenues to be spent. If the
Medical Cannabis Business Tax increase passes, the City Council may be guided by the voter's recommendation on the
advisory question in deciding how to use the revenue. However, the City Council is not legally bound by the outcome of
the vote on the advisory question. The City Council can use the revenue collected for any lawful City purpose.

This measure was placed on the ballot by the Watsonville City Council. It requires a majority vote of the electorate. A
"yes" vote is a vote in favor of recommending these uses of cannabis tax revenue to the Council. A "no" vote is a vote
against recommending these uses of cannabis tax revenue to the Council.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of the proposed Advisory Measure on Use of Cannabis Business Tax
Revenue ordinance.
