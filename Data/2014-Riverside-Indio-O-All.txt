The Top Two Candidates Open Primary Act, which took effect January 1, 2011, requires that all candidates for a voter-nominated
office be listed on the same ballot. Voter-nominated offices are state legislative offices, U.S. congressional offices, and state
constitutional offices.

In both the open primary and general elections, you can vote for any candidate, regardless of what party preference you indicated
on your voter registration form. In the primary election, the two candidates receiving the most votes—regardless of party
preference—move on to the general election regardless of vote totals. If a candidate receives a majority of the vote (50 percent +
1), a general election still must be held. Even if there are only two candidates for an office in the open primary, a general election
for that office is still required.

California’s open primary system does not apply to candidates running for local offices.

Voter-Nominated Offices

Political parties are not entitled to formally nominate candidates for voter-nominated offices at the primary election. A
candidate nominated for a voter-nominated office at the primary election is the nominee of the people and not the official nominee
of any party at the general election. A candidate for nomination to a voter-nominated office shall have his or her party preference,
or lack of party preference, stated on the ballot, but the party preference designation is selected solely by the candidate and is
shown for the information of the voters only. It does not mean the candidate is nominated or endorsed by the party designated,
or that there is an affiliation between the party and candidate, and no candidate nominated by the voters shall be deemed to be
the officially nominated candidate of any political party. In the county sample ballot booklet, parties may list the candidates for
voter-nominated offices who have received the party’s official endorsement.

Any voter may vote for any candidate for a voter-nominated office, if they meet the other qualifications required to vote
for that office. The top two vote-getters at the primary election move on to the general election for the voter-nominated office even
if both candidates have specified the same party preference designation. No party is entitled to have a candidate with its party
preference designation move on to the general election, unless the candidate is one of the two highest vote-getters at the primary
election.

Nonpartisan State Offices

Political parties are not entitled to nominate candidates for nonpartisan offices at the primary election, and a candidate
at the primary election is not the official nominee of any party for the specific office at the general election. A candidate for
nomination to a nonpartisan office may not designate his or her party preference, or lack of party preference, on the ballot. The
top two vote-getters at the primary election move on to the general election for the nonpartisan office.

New electoral district boundaries are drawn every 10 years in order to equalize district populations. Boundaries for the
congressional, state legislative, and county supervisorial districts are now different. Boundary changes also apply to any city,
school district, or special district that votes by trustee areas or divisions. To see the new district maps, visit the Registrar of
Voters website at www.voteinfo.net.

CANDIDATE STATEMENT FOR
UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE,

36TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT

BRIAN NESTANDE, Republican	AGE:	50

OCCUPATION:	State Assemblyman / Businessman

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

Congress isn’t getting anything done, and the current Congress is
one of history's worst.

In Congress, I'll work to:

S Immediately secure the border as the FIRST step in immigration
reform

s STOP the overspending and pass a balanced budget
amendment

s Hold Congress accountable - no balanced budget = no
paycheck

s Create policies that encourage businesses to expand so we
have high quality good paying jobs

Middle class families cannot afford another do-nothing Congress. In
the last two years, Congress sent America another $2 trillion deeper
into debt - an amount equal to an additional $9,000 of debt per U.S.
taxpayer.

At the same time, the cost of healthcare under Obamacare has risen
by as much as fifty percent, and millions of seniors have seen their
Medicare benefits reduced.

Worker wages have remained stagnant, and more businesses are
moving off-shore as Congress debates adding even higher taxes and
more regulations.

My wife Gina and I are raising our family and we know first-hand how
difficult Washington is making it for middle class families to get ahead.

I’ll make sure the priorities of seniors and middle-class families
are put into action, and that's the difference. That’s why I’ve been
endorsed by most of the local elected leaders in our District - people
who understand how difficult it’s been to have a voice in Congress. I
would be honored to have your vote.

CANDIDATE STATEMENT FOR
STATE SENATOR,

28TH SENATORIAL DISTRICT

JEFF STONE, Republican

OCCUPATION:	Riverside County Supervisor / Small Business

Owner

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

As a Riverside County Supervisor and longtime small business
owner, I’m proud to be running for the Senate with the support of
local taxpayers, seniors, veterans, small business owners and over
45 city council members and elected officials from the Coachella
Valley and Riverside County. Councilman Glenn Miller, who ran a
strong campaign in June, has now endorsed me.

I’m also honored to be the choice of Riverside Countv Sheriff Stan Sniff
and the Riverside Sheriffs Association. Over 3,200 law enforcement
officers and investigators in Riverside County endorse me because
they know I will OPPOSE EARLY RELEASE of dangerous prisoners
and work to keep our neighborhoods, schools and homes safe.

I signed the NO NEW TAXES pledge. As a local official, I successfully
lowered taxes without cutting vital services. I’ll work to do the same
in Sacramento.

I strongly oppose the federal government’s policy of moving illegal
immigrants from the Texas border to Riverside County communities.
The Feds need to enforce the law and control the border.

My priorities are: JOB CREATION and Improving the Business
Climate; No New Taxes, Cut Waste and Balance the Budget.

Special interests in Sacramento are spending massive sums of
money to influence your vote and defeat me. Ask yourself: do you
want a Senator who will be a voice for the special interests; or one
who will be a voice for you and Riverside County?

I’d be honored to receive your vote. Please visit www.JeffStone2014.com

CANDIDATE STATEMENT FOR
STATE SENATOR,

28TH SENATORIAL DISTRICT

BONNIE GARCIA, Republican
OCCUPATION:	Small Business Woman

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

California is broken and in dire need of commonsense solutions.

During the six years I served in the Assembly, I kept my promise
and refused to support tax increases and reckless spending. My
commitment to California’s hardworking taxpayers earned me the
support of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association and local elected
officials from across the county.

A strong workforce is more important than senseless regulations. The
California Small Business Association supports me because I created
thousands of jobs, expanded opportunities for veterans and secured
funding for small businesses.

I’m from a law enforcement and military family, value freedom
and understand personal sacrifice. The California Police Chief’s
Association and Crime Victims United have endorsed me due to my
strong support of public safety and fervent opposition toward the
Governor’s early release program for hardened criminals.

We must focus on issues that directly affect the future of our state and
its industries: namely, our dwindling water supply. As your Senator, I
will fight to ensure that California’s water supply is readily available for
those who need it most: families and small businesses that depend
on this critical resource to create jobs and sustain our high standard
of living.

With your support I will continue to use my experience and degree in
Workforce Development and Education to promote a broad array of
conservative priorities - sound fiscal policies, quality schools, safer
communities and protecting the value of every life.

Experience and ethics matter.

CANDIDATE STATEMENT FOR
MEMBER OF THE STATE ASSEMBLY,

56TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT

EDUARDO GARCIA, Democratic
OCCUPATION:	Mayor / Legislative Director

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

As a lifelong resident of the Coachella Valley, a father, and a public
servant, I want what is best for our families, residents, and local
businesses.

I am running for State Assembly to fight for the issues that matter most
to our residents: strengthening our economy, improving neighborhood
schools, and building healthier, safer communities.

As a four-term Mayor of Coachella and policy director, I have a proven
track record of building coalitions with Republicans and Democrats to
deliver results and positive solutions for our community.

As Mayor, I work with business and labor to launch local job creation
initiatives. Under my watch, Coachella invested over $100 million in
public works projects - infrastructure and transportation, parks &
recreation, and a revitalized downtown. As a result, our city is a better
place to live, work, and raise a family. During the recession, when
other cities across the state made drastic cuts and slashed services,
our residents and tax dollars were protected because of the fiscal
safeguards I helped establish.

I’ve built partnerships between the city and community-based non-
profits to expand access to health care throughout the Coachella
Valley - work that was recognized by President Bill Clinton last year.

I have the experience and proven record as an effective leader
needed to fight for the Coachella Valley in the Legislature. Please join
Congressman Raul Ruiz, firefighters, teachers, police officers, and
the California Democratic Party in supporting my campaign.

CHARLES BENNETT, Republican	AGE:	41

OCCUPATION:	Security/Public	Safety	Consultant

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:

I am Charles Bennett Jr and I am running for the 56th assembly district
to serve you, the people, as I did for our country as a US Marine for
over 10 years.

I attended public schools until the 11th grade when I attended and
graduated from a military school. Upon graduating, I attended an
aviation college prior to enlisting in the Marine Corps where I worked
as a military police officer having worked in various aspects of law
enforcement.

Upon coming to Riverside County, I used the Gl bill to attend COD
where I studied business as well as classes in economics.

Currently, I have a small business where I consult on security and
public safety issues for public and private entities, and also serve as
a contributing expert to local broadcast media.

I entered the workforce at 13 delivering newspapers. I have had a
variety jobs; some I did not like but had to do in order to pay bills. I
know what it is like to be broke and live payday to payday.

I am running to serve the people, not politicians, special interests or
agenda’s. I know what it takes to create jobs, keep our communities
and schools safe and I will make veteran’s issues a priority.

I currently live in Indio with my wife and two small children.

I am asking for your vote to represent you in Sacramento.

The following is the full proposition presented to the voters by the Desert Sands Unified School District.

PROJECT LIST

The Board of Education of the Desert Sands Unified School District is committed to maintain the quality of education in our local public
schools. To do so, the Board is determined to provide facilities and equipment needed for advance courses in math, science, engineering

and technology, upgrade career and technology education programs so students are prepared for college and good paying jobs in fields
like health sciences, technology, engineering, and skilled trades. To that end, the Board evaluated the District’s urgent and critical facility needs,
including safety issues, class size reduction, computer and information technology and prepared a Long-Range Facilities Master Plan Update,
presented to the Board on July 22, 2014, which is incorporated herein in its entirety, in developing the scope of projects to be funded. The District
conducted a facilities evaluation and received public input in developing this Project List through school site meetings, community presentations,
opinion leader input, and interactive materials. Teachers, staff, students, community members and the Board have prioritized the key health and
safety needs so that the most critical facility needs are addressed to ensure equal opportunity and access for a quality education for all local
students. The Board concluded that if these needs are not addressed now, the problems will only become more pressing and expensive to address.
Therefore, in approving this Project List, the Board of Education determines that the District must, in a fiscally responsible manner:

(i)	provide classrooms and labs for career and technology education classes so students are prepared for jobs in fields like
health sciences, engineering, technology, and skilled trades; and

(ii)	make basic repairs to schools, such as fixing leaky roofs, plumbing, electrical systems and replace outdated heating and
air-conditioning systems for energy efficiency; and

(iii)	provide the facilities and equipment needed for advanced courses in math, science, engineering and technology; and

(iv)	adhere to specific fiscal accountability safeguards such as:

(a)	ALL MONEY raised must BE USED LOCALLY and the State must be prohibited from taking any of the funds raised,

(b)	All expenditures must be subject to annual independent financial audits, and

by the District's receipt of State matching funds and the final costs of each project. In the absence of State matching funds, which the District
will aggressively pursue to reduce the District's share of the costs of the projects, the District may not be able to complete some of the projects
listed above. The budget for each project is an estimate and may be affected by factors beyond the District’s control. Some projects throughout
the District may be undertaken as joint use projects in cooperation with other local public or non-profit agencies. The final cost of each project
will be determined as plans are finalized, construction bids are awarded and projects are completed. Based on the final costs of each project,
certain of the projects described above may be delayed or may not be completed. Demolition of existing facilities and reconstruction of facilities
scheduled for repair and upgrade may occur, if the Board determines that such an approach would be more cost-effective in creating enhanced
and operationally efficient campuses. Necessary site acquisition, preparation/restoration and landscaping, may occur in connection with new
construction, renovation or remodeling, or installation or removal of relocatable classrooms, including ingress and egress, removing, replacing, or
installing irrigation, utility lines, trees and landscaping, redirecting fire access, and acquiring any necessary easements, licenses, or rights of way
to the property.

Bond proceeds shall be expended only for the specific purposes identified herein. Proceeds of the bonds may be used to pay or reimburse
the District for the cost of District staff when performing work on or necessary and incidental to the bond projects. The District shall create an
account into which proceeds of the bonds shall be deposited and comply with the reporting requirements of Government Code § 53410.

FISCAL ACCOUNTABILITY: IN ACCORDANCE WITH EDUCATION CODE SECTION 15272, THE BOARD OF EDUCATION WILL APPOINT
A CITIZENS’ OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE AND CONDUCT ANNUAL INDEPENDENT AUDITS TO ASSURE THAT FUNDS ARE SPENT ONLY ON
DISTRICT PROJECTS AND FOR NO OTHER PURPOSE. THE EXPENDITURE OF BOND MONEY ON THESE PROJECTS IS SUBJECT TO
STRINGENT FINANCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIREMENTS. BY LAW, PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL AUDITS WILL BE PERFORMED
ANNUALLY, AND ALL BOND EXPENDITURES WILL BE MONITORED BY AN INDEPENDENT CITIZENS’ OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE TO
ENSURE THAT FUNDS ARE SPENT AS PROMISED AND SPECIFIED. THE CITIZENS’ OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE MUST INCLUDE, AMONG
OTHERS, REPRESENTATION OF A BONA FIDE TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION, A BUSINESS ORGANIZATION AND A SENIOR CITIZENS
ORGANIZATION. NO DISTRICT EMPLOYEES OR VENDORS ARE ALLOWED TO SERVE ON THE CITIZENS’ OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE.

No Administrator Salaries: Proceeds from the sale of the bonds authorized by this proposition shall be used only for the acquisition,

any other purpose, including teacher and school administrator salaries and other operating expenses.

MEASURE “KK” - DESERT SANDS UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT

TAX RATE STATEMENT
REGARDING PROPOSED
$225,000,000
DESERT SANDS UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT
GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS
MEASURE“KK”

An election will be held in Desert Sands Unified School District (the “District”) on November 4, 2014, for the purpose of submitting to the
electors of the District the question of incurring a bonded indebtedness of the District in an aggregate principal amount of $225 million. If such
bonds are authorized and sold, the principal thereof and interest thereon will be payable from the proceeds of tax levies made upon the taxable
property in the District. The information contained in numbered paragraphs 1 - 3 below is provided in compliance with Section 9400-9404 of
the Elections Code of the State of California. The information is based upon the best estimates and projections presently available from official
sources, upon experience within the District, and other demonstrable factors.

Based upon the foregoing and projections of the District’s assessed valuation, and assuming the entire debt service will be paid through
property taxation:

1.	The best estimate of the highest tax which would be required to be levied to fund the bond issue during the first fiscal year after the
sale of the first series of bonds, based on estimated assessed valuations available at the time of filing of this statement, is 2.0020 per $100 ($20.02
per $100,000) of assessed valuation for fiscal year 2015-16.

2.	The best estimate from official sources of the tax rate which would be required to be levied to fund the bond issue during the first fiscal
year after the last sale of the bonds and an estimate of the year in which that rate will apply, based on estimated assessed valuations available at
the time of filing of this statement, is 6.00 per $100 ($60.00 per $100,000) of assessed valuation for fiscal year 2027-28.

3.	The best estimate of the highest tax rate which would be required to be levied to fund the bond issue and an estimate of the year
in which that rate will apply, based on estimated assessed valuation available at the time of filing of this statement, is 6.00 per $100 ($60.00 per
$100,000) of assessed valuation for fiscal year 2031-32.

Voters should note that the estimated tax rates are based on the ASSESSED VALUE of taxable property on the County’s official tax rolls,
not on the property's market value. Property owners should consult their own property tax bills to determine their property’s assessed value and
any applicable tax exceptions.

Attention of all voters is directed to the fact that the foregoing information is based upon the District’s projections and estimates only,
which is not binding upon the District. The actual tax rates and the years in which they will apply may vary from those presently estimated, due to
variations from these estimates in the timing of bond sales, the amount of bonds sold and market interest rates at the time of each sale, and actual
assessed valuations over the term of repayment of the bonds. The dates of sale and the amount of bonds sold at any given time will be determined
by the District based on its need for construction funds and other factors, including the legal limitations on bonds approved by a 55% vote. The
actual interest rates at which the bonds will be sold will depend on the bond market at the time of each sale. Actual future assessed valuation will
depend upon the amount and value of taxable property within the District as determined by the County Assessor in the annual assessment and the
equalization process.

RV 214-019

The Board of Education (“Board”) of the Desert Sands Unified
School District (“District”) by adopting Resolution No. 09/2014-2015
(“Resolution”), elected to call an election pursuant to Section 18 of
Article XVI and Section 1 of Article XIIIA of the California Constitution
and Section 15100 and 15624 et seq.of the California Education Code
to obtain authorization to issue and sell general obligation Bonds
(“Bonds”) in the aggregate amount principal amount of two hundred
and twenty five million dollars ($225,000,000).

This Measure was placed on the ballot by the Board of the above-
identified District.

The Bonds would be used by the District to refinance outstanding lease
obligations or bridge loans, repair, renovate and upgrade buildings and
infrastructure, including plumbing, lighting, electrical and heating/air
conditions systems, repair, replace and upgrade safety and security
systems and acquire, install and upgrade technology equipment,
infrastructure and fixtures. The Bonds would not be used to fund the
salaries, pensions or benefits of any board members, administrator,
and/or teachers or for other school operating expenses.

If Measure “KK” is approved, the Board of the District will appoint
a citizens’ oversight committee and conduct annual independent
audits to assure that bond funds are spent only on the construction,
reconstruction, rehabilitation, or replacement of school facilities,
including the furnishing and equipping of school facilities, or the
acquisition or lease of real property for school facilities, and for no other
purposes.

An ad valorem tax would be levied and collected on property within the
boundaries of the District to pay the principal and interest on the Bonds.

The Resolution provides that the maximum interest rate on the Bonds
will not exceed the maximum interest rate permitted by the applicable
laws of the State and the maximum term of the Bonds, or any series
thereof, will not exceed 40 years.

Approval of Measure “KK” does not guarantee that the proposed
project or projects in the Desert Sands Unified School District that are
the subject of the Bonds under Measure “KK” will be funded beyond
the local revenues generated by Measure “KK”. The District’s proposal
for the project or projects assumes the receipt of matching state funds,
which could be subject to appropriation by the Legislature or approval
of a statewide bond measure.

For this Measure to be approved fifty-five percent (55%) of qualified
voters who vote on the Measure must vote yes.

A “YES” vote on Measure “KK” is a vote to allow the District to sell the
Bonds and levy the necessary taxes to pay for the Bonds.

A “NO” vote on Measure “KK” is a vote against allowing the District to
sell the Bonds and levy the necessary taxes to pay for the Bonds.

By:	Ronak	N.	Patel,	Deputy	County	Counsel

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE “KK”

Passage of Measure “KK” will maintain the quality of local schools,
WITHOUT raising tax rates.

Desert Sands Unified School District is recognized as one of the best
school districts in the state. Test scores are up and basic repairs and
renovations of schools, paid for by previous bond measures, are being
completed. However, much still needs to be done.

Measure “KK” has been put on the ballot to continue the renovations
of our schools and to provide facilities so students who plan to go to
college are prepared to succeed, and those who don’t plan to go to
college receive the career training they need to compete for good
paying jobs.

Measure “KK” will:

•	Renovate and update facilities and equipment to provide
career technical programs and advanced courses in math,
science, engineering and technology

•	Repair/replace aging portables, roofs, floors, lighting,
electrical and plumbing systems

•	Upgrade outdated classrooms, science labs, computers, and
technology

•	Make energy-efficiency improvements, and install low water
usage irrigation systems

•	Improve the safety and security of children

Measure “KK” WON’T raise existing property tax rates. Measure “KK”
simply extends or lowers rates previously approved bv voters.

Every penny from Measure “KK” will stay in our community and may
only be used for the specific facility projects included in the District’s
detailed project list. No funds can be used for administrator salaries.
Measures “KK” requires an independent citizens’ oversight committee
and mandatory annual audits to ensure funds are spent properly.

Measure “KK” is supported by a broad coalition of teachers, principals,
parents, seniors, homeowners, business leaders, and community
leaders.

Whether or not you have school-age children, protecting and maintaining
the quality of our schools is a wise investment. The value of your home
is directly tied to the quality of local schools.

Please vote yes on Measure “KK” for quality schools.

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE “0”

The City of Indio’s current transient occupancy tax (TOT) is 10% of the
room charge that hotel and lodging facilities impose on their transients
(guests) and has been in effect since April 1, 1989. TOT is paid by
persons staying at such facilities for a period of thirty (30) days or less
and is not paid by property owners.

Measure “0” will increase the TOT from 10% to 13% for hotel and
lodging facilities with less than 50 rooms and on occupancies in any
campground or recreational vehicle park. Transients in hotel and
lodging facilities with 50 rooms or more already pay a 13% “surcharge”
made up of 10% TOT, a 2% assessment levied by a multi-jurisdictional
Tourism Business improvement District, and a 1% assessment levied by
a multi-jurisdictional Tourism Marketing District. Measure “O” will provide
uniformity of among hotel and lodging facilities regardless of the
number of rooms by ensuring that transients will pay either 13% in TOT
or 10% in TOT plus 3% in assessments. If the City ceases participating
in either the improvement or marketing district, then the TOT collected
by lodging facilities with 50 or more rooms will increase in accordance
with the reduction in assessments collected. Measure “0” also clarifies
the definition of hotels to include campgrounds and provides a definition
of campgrounds.

If Measure “0” is approved, persons staying at hotels and lodging
facilities regardless of the number of rooms, including campgrounds
or recreational vehicle parks would pay $13.00 in surcharges for each
$100 of the room charge per day (either $13.00 in TOT or $10.00 in TOT
and $3.00 assessment).

Revenue generated by the TOT will continue to be deposited into the
City’s General Fund and may be used to continue to fund general City
services such as police, firefighters, paramedics, senior and youth
services and parks. If Measure “O” is approved, it is estimated that TOT
revenue will increase by approximately $514,656 per fiscal year.

On July 16,2014, the City Council unanimously approved Resolution
No. 9725 to place this Measure on the ballot.

A “Yes” vote on Measure “O” is a vote in favor of increasing the TOT from
10% to 13% and will result in uniformity among all hotel and lodging
facilities regardless of the number of rooms, including campgrounds
and recreational vehicles. A “No” vote on Measure “O” is a vote to
maintain the TOT at the existing rate of 10% for hotel and lodging
facilities including campgrounds and recreational vehicle parks except
those persons staying at hotel and lodging facilities with 50 or more
rooms, will continue to pay 10% in TOT and 3% in assessments. This
Measure “O” will be adopted if it is approved by a majority of the voters
voting on this Measure.

Measure “0”. If you desire a copy of the measure,
please call the elections official’s office at (760) 391-
4000 and a copy will be mailed at no cost to you.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE “O”

Vote YES on “O”! Maintain and protect Indio’s essential City services
without raising homeowners’ taxes.

Measure “0” is NOT a tax on homes or property. For years, hotel or
lodging guests in Indio have paid a “transient occupancy tax” on hotel
rooms. This type of tax is onjy paid by hotel or lodging guests, nearly
all of whom are visitors or travelers stopping in Indio to shop or attend
our events. Other Indio residents and property owners are NOT taxed.

YES on “0” simply continues and updates an existing, reliable funding
source that supports essential City services we all rely on, without
raising taxes on vour personal property or home.

•	YES on “0” maintains rapid 9-1-1 emergency response times
and funding for police officers, firefighters, and paramedics.

•	YES on “0” maintains funding for emergency reserves, so our
City can respond effectively to a major crisis, like an earthquake.

•	YES on “0” helps increase police patrols in our neighborhoods,
parks and local schools and continues anti-gang and drug
enforcement programs.

•	YES on “0” maintains funding for youth and senior services,
park improvements, street maintenance and pothole repair.

YES on “0” ensures that hotel guests and visitors to Indio pay their fair
share for our services. By law, Measure “0” provides local funding that
cannot be taken by Sacramento, ensuring Local Control. Sacramento
politicians can’t touch this money!

Measure “0” funding would be subject to annual independent financial
audits to ensure that all voter-approved funds are spent appropriately.

YES on “0” simply updates an already-existing hotel tax that has been
in place for years, so all hotel or lodging operators are charging the-
same percentage to their guests - and will NOT otherwise increase
vour property or homeowner taxes whatsoever.
