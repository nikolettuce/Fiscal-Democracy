RESOLUTION PROPOSING AN EXTENSION OF A SPECIAL TAX AND
CALLING FOR ELECTION FOR VOTER APPROVAL

WHEREAS, the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District ("District") has been

inadequately funded by the State for a period of years to the detriment of its
educational programs; and

WHEREAS, the District has engaged in a variety of efforts to generate funds for the

educational program, including advocating in the State Legislature, local fund
raising efforts, and cost-cutting measures, including employee layoffs and cutting
budgets, and these efforts have not produced sufficient revenues to raise the
quality of education and maintain the facilities in the District; and

WHEREAS, Section 4 of Article XIIIA of the California Constitution and Government Code
Section 50075 et.seq. authorizes a school District, following notice and public
hearing, to levy a tax for specified purposes upon approval of two-thirds of the
electorate voting on the measure; and

WHEREAS, this Board believes that a special tax that is an adjustment to and extension of the
existing tax, equaling $98 per parcel, adjusted annually for inflation in accordance
with the CPI-U (as hereafter defined), to provide, maintain, and expand
educational opportunities for the students of this District;

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that:

1.	The Board hereby proposes to continue to levy a special tax for the specific purposes
enumerated in Section 8 of this Resolution;

2.	Said special tax shall not exceed the maximum rate of $98 per year adjusted annually for
inflation in accordance with the CPI-U for a temporary period of ten (10) years or less
assessed against each parcel of land;

Prior to levying of the special tax in any given year, the Board will conduct a public
hearing on the matter. Notice of the time, date and place of hearing shall be published in
accordance with applicable laws, posted at least twice in a newspaper of general
circulation in the District, posting shall commence at least fifteen (15) days prior to the
hearing. Following said hearing each year, the Board shall adopt a resolution establishing
the amount of tax to be raised for that year and the rate per parcel, not to exceed $98 per
year adjusted annually for inflation in accordance with the CPI-U for each parcel. CPI-U
as used in this Resolution shall refer to the Consumer Price Index for All Urban
Consumers (Los Angeles-Riverside-Orange area), base year 1982-84 = 100, or its
equivalent should this Index cease to exist in its current format. The annual CPI-U
adjustment shall be based on the increase in the CPI-U in the preceding fiscal year. Any
tax levied shall become a lien upon the properties against which taxes are assessed and
collectable as herein provided;

penalty shall bear interest at the same rate as the rate for unpaid ad valorem property taxes
until paid;

provided for herein shall decrease the funds available from
other sources of the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School
