STATE

PROPOSITION 55. KINDERGARTEN-UNIVERSITY
PUBLIC EDUCATION FACILITIES BOND ACT OF 2004.

This twelve billion three hundred million dollar
($12,300,000,000) bond issue will provide funding for
necessary education facilities to relieve overcrowding and
to repair older schools. Funds will be targeted to areas of
the greatest need and must be spent according to strict
accountability measures. Funds will also be used to
upgrade and build new classrooms in the California
Community Colleges, the California State University, and
the University of California, to provide adequate higher
education facilities to accommodate the growing student
enrollment. These bonds may be used only for eligible
projects. Fiscal Impact: State costs of about $24.7 billion
to pay off both the principal ($12.3 billion) and interest
($12.4 billion) costs on the bonds. Payments of about
$823 million per year.

oYes
oNo

PROPOSITION 56. STATE BUDGET, RELATED TAXES,
AND RESERVE. VOTING REQUIREMENTS.
PENALTIES. INITIATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL
AMENDMENT AND STATUTE. Permits enactment of
budget and budget-related tax/appropriation bills with 55%
vote. Legislature, Governor forfeit compensation each day
budget is late. Fiscal Impact: Varying impacts from
lowering the vote requirement for budget-related
measures-including changes in spending and potentially
significant increases in state tax revenues in some years.
Impacts would depend on the composition and actions of
future Legislatures.

oYes

O

No

PROPOSITION 57. THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY BOND
ACT. One time bond of up to fifteen billion dollars
($15,000,000,000) to retire deficit. Fiscal Impact: One-time
increase, compared to previously authorized bond, of up
to $4 billion to reduce the state's budget shortfall and
annual debt-service savings over the next few years.
These effects would be offset by higher annual debt-
service costs in subsequent years due to this bond's
longer term and larger size.

oYes

o

No

PROPOSITION 58. THE CALIFORNIA BALANCED
BUDGET ACT. Requires the enactment of a balanced
budget, addresses fiscal emergencies, and establishes a
budget reserve. Fiscal Impact: Net state fiscal effects
unknown and will vary by year, depending in part on
actions of future legislatures. Reserve previsions may
smooth state spending, with reductions during economic
expansions and increases during downturns. Provisions
requiring balanced budgets and limiting deficit borrowing
could result in more immediate actions to correct
budgetary shortfalls.

Yes

The proceeds of the tax will be deposited in a separate account.

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL ROSAMOND COMMUNITY SERVICES DISTRICT MEASURE 1	ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF ^ MEASURE 1  ROSAMOND COMMUNITY SERVICES DISTRICT
A “Yes” vote by at least two-thirds of the voters voting on this measure will autho- rize the Board of Directors of the Rosamond Community Services District (“Dis- trict”) toJevy annually a special tax in the amount of $24.00 per fiscal year for each developed parcel of real property and each mobile home, listed on the Kern County Tax Collector’s Roll 6, located within the boundaries of the District. The special tax, if approved, will be subject to increase on July 1 of each year by the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers for the Los Angeles-Anaheim-Rtverside area but in no event will the annual increase ex- ceed two percent (2%) in any fiscal year.  The District intends to use the special tax revenues for the purpose of providing street lighting within the District. The proceeds of the tax will only be used for that purpose.  The special tax shall be collected in the same manner, and subject to the same penalty, as other charges collected by the County on behalf of the District. >  The proceeds of the tax will be deposited in a separate account. The chief finan- cial officer of the District will file an annual report with the Board of Directors of the District. That report will contain the amount of funds collected and expended and the status of any project required or authorized to be funded by the special tax.  This wording applies to Measure 1:  The above statement is an impartial analysis of Ordinance or Measure 1. If you de- sire a copy of the ordinance or measure, please call the elections official’s office at (661) 868-3590 or 1-800-452-8683 and a copy will be mailed at no cost to you.	Customers of Rosamond Community Services District (RCSD) have been paying $1.00 per month for each commercial and residential unit to pay for streetlights. RCSD will be unable to continue subsidizing the street lighting in the future. RCSD is proposing a $24.00 per fiscal year, per parcel Special Tax ($2.00 per month) to be collected on the Kern County Tax Bills to replace the current $1.00 per month charge on the RCSD bill.  Street lighting is important for public safety for those who go out at night and are certainly worth more that 61/2 cents a day that the residents will be paying for the service. The special tax will insure the continued funding of street lights.  The special tax rate can automatically increase each year in accordance with the Consumer Price Index but in no case shall the Consumer Price Index exceed 2% of the Special Tax levied in the previous fiscal year.  Approval of this special tax will place the first levy of $24.00 per fiscal year per par- cel on the October 2004/05 tax bill. The $ 1.00 per month charge on the RCSD util- ity bills will continue through June 1,2004.  s/John E. (Jack) Roth, Director, RCSD s/Kathleen S.
