TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY

follows:

The City Council of the City of Long Beach ordains as follows:

Section 1. Chapter 3.95 is hereby added to Title 3 of the Long Beach Municipal Code to read as

Chapter 3.95

shelter or enclosure of persons, animals, chattels or property of any kind.

B.	"Parcel" means a unit of real property as shown on the last equalized assessment roil of Los
Angeles County.

3.95.020 Exemptions

A.	Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed as imposing a tax upon any person when imposition
of such tax upon that person would be in violation of either the Constitutions of the United States or the State
of California.

B.	The tax imposed by this Chapter shall not be levied upon the federal government, the state
government, any state agency, or any local governmental agency.

C.	The tax imposed by this Chapter shall not be levied upon a parcel of property or improvement
which is owned and used by an organization described in Sections 501(c), 501(d) or 401(a) of Title 26 of
the United States Code. All sections of the United States Code shall mean those sections as they exist on
the effective date of this Chapter and as they may be amended thereafter.

3.95.030	Special Police Tax

A.	There is hereby imposed a special tax on each parcel and the use of property within the City of
Long Beach to finance additional police protection. The maximum rates for such tax shall be as set forth
in Section 3.95.060. The special tax shall be for each fiscal year, commencing with the fiscal year 1993-94
on July 1, 1993.

B.	This tax is enacted under the authority of the Long Beach City Charter and authority held as a
Chartered City of the State of California and, independently thereof, under the authority of any applicable
provisions of law.

3.95.040	Purpose

A. The purpose of this Special Police Tax is to finance the employment of up to one hundred
additional police officers and the equipment and expenses required to support them. To this end, the
revenues from the tax must be used to finance the costs of an increase of up to one hundred authorized
regular police officer positions to be primarily assigned patrol duties, and for related equipment and
expenses.

B. The Long Beach City Council may provide for the collection of the special tax in the same
manner and subject to the same penalties as, or with, other charges and taxes fixed and collected by the
City, or by the County of Los Angeles on behalf of the City of Lpng Beach. If the special tax is collected by
the County on behalf of the City, the County may deduct its reasonable costs incurred for such service.
3.95.050 Special Police tax Fund

A.	A separate account entitled the Special Police Tax Fund is hereby established. The taxes
collected pursuant to this Chapter shall be placed in the Special Police Tax Fund to be used exclusively for
the purpose for which the tax is imposed, and for no other purpose. Nothing in this Section shall prevent
the use of these funds to reimburse the General Fund when money is advanced from the General Fund to
pay for the uses provided for in this Chapter.

B.	If at the end of any fiscal year any unencumbered money raised by the Special Police Tax
remains, it may be used in a succeeding fiscal year for the purposes stated in this Chapter. The existence
of a surplus in any succeeding year shall be considered by the City Council when fixing the rates of tax for
that succeeding year.

levied which shall not exceed the maximum amount established by this Chapter, as adjusted annually,
without the approval of the voters by a two-thirds majority. However, the levy of less than the maximum rate
in any fiscal year shall not prevent a subsequent levy of taxes for any succeeding fiscal year up to the
maximum limits with annual adjustments for each preceding fiscal year as set forth in this Section.
3.95.070 Adjustments and Refunds

A. .Whenever it is alleged that the amount of any tax has been overpaid or paid more than once or

Management who shall consider and decide upon such appeal. The decision of the Director shall be final.

D.	If the County of Los Angeles does not attempt to collect any tax due under this Chapter, then the
City shall have the power and duty to enforce all of the provisions of this Chapter. In such cases the City may
make an assessment for taxes not paid against the owner of a parcel and improvements, or the owner of
improvements on another’s land, in the manner provided by law.

3.95.080 Tax Due - Installments

The Special Police Tax shall be due in two equal installments in accordance with the collection
procedures of the Los Angeles County Tax Collector with the first installment due November 1st and the second
installment due February 1st in each fiscal year. The owner of the land, land and improvements, or
improvements, at the time set forth in California Revenue and Taxation Code Sections 405 and 2192 for each
fiscal year, shall have a personal obligation to the City of Long Beach until the tax is paid for each fiscal year.

Amendments relating to procedural provisions of this Chapter 3.95 may be made by ordinance adopted
by the City Council.

Sec. 2. This Ordinance No. C-7020, adopted August 4, 1992, shall be submitted to the voters of the
City of Long Beach. The taxes determined and proposed by this ordinance shall be levied only if this ordinance,
enacting Chapter 3.95 of the Long Beach Municipal Code, is approved by a vote of not less than two-thirds of the voters
voting. If approved by the requisite number of voters, Chapter 3.95 shall thereafter be considered a part of the Long
Beach Municipal Code.

Sec. 3. A special municipal election shall be and is hereby ordered and will be held in the City on
Tuesday, November 3, 1992, at which election shall be submitted to the qualified electors of the City the question of
imposing a special tax for the purpose of additional police services as set forth in the following measure:
PROPOSITION H: SPECIAL TAX FOR ADDITIONAL POLICE OFFICERS

Shall Ordinance No. C-7020 of the City of Long Beach, authorizing the City Council to levy annually a special
tax for the purpose of providing an increase of one hundred additional police officer positions and related
equipment and expenses, with annual indexing, be approved?

Sec. 4. The Council does hereby submit to the qualified electors of the City at said special municipal
election said ordinance, and designates and refers to said measure in the form of the ballot hereinafter prescribed for
use at said election.

A.	Said special municipal election shall be held and conducted, and the votes thereof canvassed, and
the returns thereof made, and the result thereof ascertained and determined, as herein provided; and in all
particulars not prescribed by this ordinance, said election shall be held as provided by law for the holding of
municipal elections in the City.

B.	All persons qualified to vote at municipal elections in the City upon the date of the election herein
provided for shall be qualified to vote upon the measure submitted at said special municipal election.

C.	The polls at the polling places hereinafter designated shall-be opened at 7:00 o’clock A.M. of said
day of election and shall be kept open continuously thereafter until 8:00 o’clock P.M. of said day of election,
when the polls shall be closed (except as provided in Section 14301 of the Elections Code), and the election
officers shall thereupon proceed to canvass the ballots cast thereat.

D.	Said special municipal election hereby called shall be consolidated with the State of California
General Election to be held in Los Angeles County and in the City on November 3,1992, all as required by and
pursuant to law; and the election precincts, polling places and officers of election within the City for said special
municipal election hereby called shall be the same as those selected and designated by the Board of
Supervisors of Los Angeles County for said State of California General Election to be held within the City and
to be set forth in the notice of election officers and polling places for said State of California General Election
to be published by the Registrar of Voters of Los Angeles County, as required by law, to which notice reference
is hereby specifically made for a designation of the precincts, polling places and election officers of the special
municipal election hereby called. Only qualified voters of the City shall be permitted to vote at said special
municipal election. The Board of Supervisors of Los Angeles County is authorized to canvass, or cause to be
canvassed, the returns of said special municipal election with respect to the votes cast in the City and to certify
the results to the Council.

E.	On the ballots to be used at said State of California General Election and said spedial
municipal election hereby consolidated therewith, in addition to all other matters required by law
to be printed thereon, shall appear the measure set forth in Section 3 hereof.

Sec. 5. Declaration of Urgency This ordinance is an urgency measure because the City
currently faces a fiscal crisis, partly due to action by the State to reduce revenues which the City previously
received, and the continuing uncertainty regarding the City’s funding levels and financial assistance from
the State, and partly due to reduced revenues resulting from the deep and pervasive redession throughout
the State and nation. Because of increasing crime rates and civil unrest, there is a serious present need
for additional police officers in the Long Beach Police Department to enhance and improve officer
deployment and efficiency and patrol frequency and effectiveness to significantly control and reduce crime
within the City and adequately protect the citizens of this community, and because the funding of said
additional police officers is beyond the financial ability of the City without a special tax approved by two-
thirds of the electors, it is urgently necessary that the special tax measure set forth herein be presented
to the electors in an expeditious manner in order for said additional police officers to be funded and
recruited as soon as possible.

Sec. 6. The City Clerk is hereby authorized and directed to publish a notice containing said
proposed ordinance, specifying the date on which the same is to be voted upon by said qualified electors,
which date is November 3, 1992. Such notice shall be published once a week for two successive weeks
in the Long Beach Press Telegram, and in each edition thereof during the day of publication, which
newspaper is hereby designated as the official newspaper of the City of Long Beach for the publication of
said notice. Said publication shall be made and completed not more than eighty-nine and not less than
seventy-five days prior to the date set for said election. The Clerk is authorized and directed to prepare
and keep in her office a sufficient supply of copies of said proposed ordinance, printed in convenient
pamphlet form, and in type of not less than 10-point, and to distribute the same to any and all persons
applying therefor, and to mail copies thereof to each of the qualified electors of the City of Long Beach.

Sec. 7. The City Clerk shall file a duly certified copy of this ordinance forthwith with the
Board of Supervisors of the County of Los Angeles and also a copy with the Registrar-Recorder of said
County.

Sec. 8. If any section, subsection, part, clause, sentence or phrase of this ordinance is for
any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional by the decision of any Court of competent jurisdiction, the
validity of the remaining portions of the ordinance, and the tax imposed shall not be affected thereby but
shall remain in full force and effect, it being the intention of the City Council and the voters to adopt each
and every section, subsection, part, clause, sentence or phrase regardless of whether any other section,
subsection, part, clause, sentence or phrase or the application thereof is held to be invalid or
unconstitutional.

Sec. 9. A separate roll call and vote on the question of the emergency of this ordinance
and to its passage by the vote of five members of the City Council of the City of Long Beach shall be taken,
and it shall become effective immediately. The City Clerk shall so certify and cause the same to be posted
in three conspicuous places in the City.

This ordinance shall also be adopted by the City Council as a regular ordinance to take
effect on the thirty-first day after it is approved by the Mayor, to the end that in the event of any defect or
invalidity in connection with the adoption of this ordinance as an emergency ordinance, the same shall,
nevertheless, be and become effective on the thirty-first day after it is approved by the Mayor, and the City
Clerk shall certify to the passage of this ordinance by the City Council of the City of Long Beach, and it
shall, in any event, take effect on the thirty-first day after it is approved by the Mayor.

Noes: Councilmembers: Absent: Councilmembers:	Clark, Robbins, Topsy-Elvord, Grabinski, Kellogg, Harwood. *. None.  None.

Proposition H approves an ordinance which imposes a special tax to finance additional police
protection by the employment of up to one hundred additional police officers, primarily assigned patrol
duties, and the equipment and expenses required to support them. It establishes the maximum tax rates
and authorizes the Long Beach City Council to thereafter levy the special tax annually up to the maximum
rates. The basis for the tax and maximum tax rates are established in the proposed new Chapter 3.95 of
the Long Beach Municipal Code as set forth in the voters’ pamphlet. A Special Police Tax Fund is
established to receive all special taxes collected, and the ordinance expressly provides that all taxes
collected must be used exclusively for the purpose for which the tax is proposed and for no other purpose.
The annual rate of the special tax may not exceed the maximum rate as automatically adjusted based upon
the Consumer Price Index of the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim Metropolitan Area. The Proposition
also includes provisions for refunds, the installment payment of taxes and authorization for the City Council
to enact procedural amendments.

Crime in Long Beach has risen at an alarming rate -- a whopping 60% since 1977! Unfortunately the size
of our police force has risen just 17%. Today, that thin blue line separating us from chaos is getting
thinner.

Two tough questions face law abiding citizens:	*

o Can we afford to let the gangs, drug dealers, muggers, and thieves destroy the quality of life in our
City?

o How do we take back our streets?

The answer lies in:

o Putting more officers on the street;
o	Reducing police response times; and

o	Adopting "Community Oriented Policing".

Proposition H will put 100 new police officers on the streets of Long Beach. These officers will be
committed exclusively to patrolling neighborhoods -- getting to know the residents and the bad guys. It’s
a proven way to reduce crime.

The economic price of crime that we pay yearly in Long Beach runs into the tens of millions of dollars.
Proposition H costs a modest 8 to 16 cents per day, depending on home size. Proposition H is a small
price to pay compared to what crime is costing us today. Proposition H is an investment in the safety of
our citizens and our neighborhoods.

Remember, there is no issue which is more important than the safety of our homes, our families, and our
loved ones.

Please vote to maintain a liveable level of safety from criminal harm in our City. Vote YES on
Proposition H -■ It’s a fight we can’t afford to lose.

ORDINANCE C-7020 LEGALLY MANDATES NEW TAXES.

ORDINANCE C-7020 DOES NOT MANDATE THE HIRING OF EVEN ONE "NEW" POLICE OFFICER!

PLEASE, CAREFULLY READ THE FOLLOWING DEFINITIVE LEGAL DESCRIPTION OF SECTION

3.95.040	REGARDING THE “PURPOSE" OF THE TAX:

"THE PURPOSE OF THIS SPECIAL POLICE TAX IS TO FINANCE THE EMPLOYMENT OF UP
TO ONE HUNDRED ADDITIONAL POLICE OFFICERS AND THE EQUIPMENT AND EXPENSES
REQUIRED TO SUPPORT THEM ... THE REVENUES FROM THE TAX MUST BE USED TO
FINANCE THE COSTS OF UP TO ONE HUNDRED AUTHORIZED REGULAR POLICE OFFICER
POSITIONS TO BE PRIMARILY ASSIGNED PATROL DUTIES, ..."

DO THE WORDS CONTAINED IN SECTION 3.95.040,

"...REVENUES FROM THE TAX MUST BE USED TO FINANCE ... UP TO ONE HUNDRED
AUTHORIZED REGULAR POLICE OFFICER POSITIONS TO BE PRIMARILY ASSIGNED
PATROL DUTIES. ..."

SUBSTANTIALLY HAVE THE SAME MEANING AS THOSE IN THE "IN FAVOR" ARGUMENT?

THAT ARGUMENT STATES:

"PROPOSITION H WILL PUT 100 NEW POLICE OFFICERS ON THE STREETS OF LONG
BEACH ... COMMITTED EXCLUSIVELY TO PATROLLING NEIGHBORHOODS."

GET YOUR ATTORNEY’S LEGAL OPINION BEFORE YOU VOTE TO PAY THIS TAX.

PUBLIC SAFETY AND COMMUNITY PEACE ARE THE MOST BASIC GOVERNMENTAL
RESPONSIBILITIES. THEY SHOULD NOJ DEPEND UPON A SPECIAL TAX. THEY SHOULD
CONTINUE TO BE SUPPORTED BY GENERAL REVENUES.

THE LONG BEACH CITY CHARTER PLACES THE PRIMARY AND THE FINAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR
DEFINING BUDGETARY PRIORITIES, AND THE EXPENDITURE OF TAXPAYERS’ HARD-EARNED
DOLLARS UPON THE MAYOR AND THE CITY COUNCIL. THEY HAVE NOT FULFILLED THEIR
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES.

PROPOSITION H, PROPOSED BY THE MAYOR, AND PLACED ON THE BALLOT BY THE COUNCIL
REPRESENTS A BLATANT MISUSE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE POWERS.

PROPOSITION H PROVIDES AN OFFICIAL POLITICAL EXCUSE NOT TO IMMEDIATELY, FINALLY,
AND MEANINGFULLY REDEFINE OUR CITY-WIDE BUGETARY PRIORITIES.

NEITHER THE MAYOR NOR THE CITY COUNCIL HAVE EFFECTIVELY DIRECTED THE CITY
MANAGER TO USE GENERAL REVENUES TO FUND ADDITIONAL POLICE OFFICERS, AND TO
MAKE NECESSARY ECONOMIES.

BY 1989, LONG BEACH WAS ALREADY SPENDING $2,898 PER CITIZEN, ANNUALLY, TO RUN THE
CITY: $866 MORE THAN LOS ANGELES; AND, MORE THAN THE 25 LARGEST CITIES IN LA.
COUNTY!

THERE IS NO SOUND REASON WHY THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE IN LONG BEACH
SHOULD BE DEPRIVED OF ADEQUATE POLICE SERVICES IF 1/3 PLUS ONE OF THE VOTERS VOTE
AGAINST PROPOSITION H.

DAN ROSENBERG

LONG BEACH PUBLIC ACCESS TELEVISION PRODUCER

Yes, Public Safety is the most basic governmental responsibility. Public Safety should be and is the
number one priority in the City of Long Beach. Public safety consumes more of the City Budget now than
at any time in the past, both in terms of dollars and as a percentage of the General Fund. Still, we’re
losing the fight against crime.

Just how would the opponents of Proposition H propose to restructure the City’s priorities? Would they cut
Parks and Recreation or other alternatives to keep kids off the streets and out of gangs? Would they cut
Library Services, thereby obstructing our students’ quest for a decent education?

Long Beach needs successful Community Oriented Policing, which is proactive policing at its best. With
Community Oriented Policing, we can take back our streets from thugs, gangs, and drug dealers; we can
feel safe in our homes and neighborhoods again. Long Beach has barely half the number of officers per

1,000	population of most major cities. In order for Community Oriented Policing to succeed here, we need
2 officers per 1,000 population minimum. That means we need 100 more patrol officers!

Please vote to make Community Oriented Policing succeed: Vote YES on Proposition Hi
