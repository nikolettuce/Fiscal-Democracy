Shall the City of South San Francisco be authorized to collect a business license tax from owners and operators of commercial billboards located
within the City equal to eight percent (8%) of the gross receipts received from such advertising with the revenue from the tax specifically reserved for
park, recreation, library and public safety services?

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE J

Existing California law authorizes cities to collect a general excise tax
on the privilege of operating a business within the City (“business license
tax”). The City of South San Francisco has previously adopted Ordinance
No. 720 which provides for the imposition and collection of a business
license tax to be paid by owners and operators of businesses located in the
City.

Measure J would impose a special business license tax on those
persons, firms, corporations or companies owning or operating
off-premises advertising signs where such signs are located within the City
and contain equal to or greater than 250 square feet of advertising copy.
The amount of tax would be eight percent (8%) of the gross receipts
obtained from advertising on the billboards located in the City. The
ordinance under consideration as part of Measure J also establishes
procedures for the payment of the tax. Measure J does not modify any
other existing business license tax in South San Francisco.

The tax revenues from the special business license tax proposed as part
of Measure J may only be used for park, library, recreation and public
safety services. Thus, the tax proposed in Measure J is a special tax under
California law and therefore requires that two-thirds of the voters approve
Measure J for the special tax to be adopted.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE J

Vote Yes on Measure J. to Tax Out of Town Billboard Operators

Virtually all businesses operating in South San Francisco pay a business
license tax, with a notable exception being out of town billboard operators.
Measure J would close a loophole in the City’s Municipal Code and charge
billboard operators an 8% tax on the advertising revenue they receive. This
new tax measure would only apply to out of town businesses that advertise
on large, commercial billboards in South San Francisco; it would not be
applied to companies that advertise their business on their own sites, and it
would not be applied to small billboards.

Funds from this tax would be put in a special fund to help preserve and
restore services in the General Fund that have been cut dramatically over
the past 3 years in the areas of public safety, libraries, and parks and
recreation. Besides the economic slowdown, our city has lost millions of
dollars to the State, and has had to cut $7.0 million in programs and
services in areas such as:

•	Public Safety: reduction of police officers, code enforcement and fire
prevention staff, as well as fire personnel that are available to respond
to emergencies;

•	Library: reduction in the number of days and hours open at the Grand
Ave. and West Orange Libraries;

•	Parks: one parks worker has been eliminated, and materials to keep the
parks clean and green have been slashed;

•	Recreation: reduction in weekend staffing at various locations, as well
as a reduction in childcare staffing, and elimination of some classes for
the community.

If Measure J passes, funds would go a long way towards preserving and
restoring these vital services. Make out of town billboard owners pay their
share! Please vote yes on Measure J.

RESOLUTION OF THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO

A RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING PLACEMENT ON THE
NOVEMBER BALLOT A MEASURE SEEKING VOTER
AUTHORIZATION TO COLLECT A BUSINESS LICENSE TAX ON
THOSE ENTITIES HAVING ADVERTISING SIGNS LOCATED
WITHIN THE CITY BASED UPON THE GROSS RECEIPTS OF
THOSE ENTITIES FROM REVENUE DERIVED FROM SAID SIGNS
AND AMENDING TITLE 6 OF THE SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO
MUNICIPAL CODE, BUSINESS REGUIATIONS, TO SPECIFY
ENTITIES SUBJECT TO THE LICENSE REQUIREMENT AND
ESTABLISHING PROCEDURES FOR COLLECTING THE
BUSINESS LICENSE TAX

WHEREAS, pursuant to its authority under California Revenue and Taxation Code
Sections 7280 et seq., the City Council of the City of South San Francisco adopted Ordinance
No. 720, codified as Title 6 of the Municipal Code, which provided for the imposition and
collection of a general excise tax on the privilege of operating a business within the City (a
“business license tax”) to be paid by owners and operators of businesses located in the City; and

WHEREAS, the City Council has determined that certain business operators, because
they do not have physical business addresses within the City limits, have not been subject to the
existing business license tax; and

WHEREAS, in order to ensure that all businesses deriving revenue from operations in the
City are treated equally, the City Council has determined that amendments to Title 6 are
required; and

WHEREAS, the proposed amendments would impose a tax on those persons, firms,
corporations or companies owning or operating off-premises advertising signs where such signs
are located within the City and containing equal to or greater than 250 square feet of advertising
copy; and

WHEREAS, Article XIIIC, Section 2(b) of the California Constitution requires that any
special tax, such as this business license tax, must be approved by a 2/3 majority vote of the
voters voting on the issue of imposing the tax; and

WHEREAS, the City Council of the City of South San Francisco (the City Council)
expressed its intent to impose a business license tax on billboard advertisers in the amount of
eight percent (8%) of the gross receipts obtained from advertising on the billboards located in the
City during the duly noticed regular meeting held July 14, 2004; and

WHEREAS, a substantial portion of the City’s General Fund (as established in the City’s
budget for Fiscal Year 2004-2005) is used for public safety purposes (police and fire protection
services) and the City Council has determined that imposing a business license tax on billboard

1

advertisers is an effective way of preserving other vital public services such as park, library, and
public safety services at or near current levels; and

WHEREAS, after receiving information at its July 14, 2004 City Council meeting and
prior budget workshops regarding the effects of the current economy and State budget on the
City’s finances and ability to fund necessary community services, and after subsequently
receiving testimony from the public, the City Council determined that the public interest would
be well served by asking the voters of South San Francisco to authorize a business license tax for
billboard advertising in an amount equal to eight percent (8%) of the gross receipts obtained by
the owner/operator for such advertising; and

WHEREAS, given the uncertainty in the state budget, the City needs to identify revenue
sources for fiscal year 2005-2006 and thereafter in order to provide continuity in public safety,
library, parks and recreation services; and

WHEREAS, the billboard advertisers business license tax is hereby proposed as a Special
Tax with revenues derived from the increase specifically designated to fund park, recreation,
public safety and library services; and

WHEREAS, pursuant to Government Code Section 50075.1, the City declares that the
proceeds from the special tax shall only be used for the purposes designated herein and that an
account shall be created for the purpose of maintaining such revenues. An accounting of the
funds deposited and report of all funds deposited and expended shall occur on an annual basis in
accordance with the provisions of Government Code Section 50075.3; and

WHEREAS, the tax imposed pursuant to this measure will be collected in accordance
with the procedures established in Exhibit A, including any references contained therein; and

WHEREAS, as a Special Tax, the tax must be approved by a 2/3 majority vote; and

WHEREAS, after considering the foregoing information, the Council believes that the
extension of the existing business license tax to commercial billboard operators provides for a
more equitable distribution of tax liability for business owners by capturing businesses that
derive revenue from advertising in the City but are not subject to the existing tax because they do
not have an office or facility in the City; and

WHEREAS, the City Council has determined that an eight percent (8%) tax on the gross
receipts of said billboard operators should be authorized by the voters of South San Francisco
with implementation of the tax effective January 1, 2005; and

WHEREAS, the cost of conducting the Special Election is $26,000 and will be paid out
of the City Clerk’s budget pursuant to the authorization contained in Resolution No. 75-2004,
adopted by a 2/3 majority vote of the City Council on July 28, 2004; and

WHEREAS, based on all of the information presented at the July 28, 2004 City Council
meeting, both written and oral, including the staff reports, minutes, and other relevant materials
(hereafter the “Record”), the City Council finds that under CEQA Guidelines 15060(c)(2); and
