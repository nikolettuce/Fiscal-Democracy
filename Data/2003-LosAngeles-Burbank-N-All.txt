MEASURE N
ORDINANCE NO. 3612

Sec. 14-1903. Tax Imposed.

For the privilege of occupying space in any parking facility in the City of
Burbank, each transient occupant is subject to and shall pay a tax in the
amount of ten percent (10%) of the parking fee. The tax rate may be
modified from time to time by resolution of the City Council, after a public
hearing on such matter, provided, however, that the rate may not exceed
twelve percent (12%). The tax imposed by this Article shall be paid upon
any occupancy by a transient occupant on and after February 1, 1996,
although such occupancy may be pursuant to a contract, lease or other
arrangement made prior to such date. Where the parking fee is paid, or
charged or billed, or falls due on either a weekly or other term basis, the
parking fee so paid, charged, billed or fallen due shall be subject to the tax
herein imposed to the extent that it covers any portion of the period
occurring on or after February 1, 1996, and such payment, charge, bill or
parking fee due shall be apportioned on the basis of the proration of the
number of days covered thereby. In computing the tax herein imposed, the
fractional part of one cent shall be disregarded unless it amounts to one-
half of one cent or more, in which case the amount shall be increased to
the next highest cent. The tax herein imposed constitutes a debt owed by
the transient occupant to the City, which is extinguished by payment to the
operator or the City.

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE N

The City’s existing transient parking tax is imposed on people who pay for
short term parking in the City at parking facilities such as at the airport, a
hotel, an office building or a conference center.

The tax does not apply to monthly residential or employee parking nor does the
tax, apply to parking at hospitals or medical facilities. The tax has no effect on
those who do not pay to park. The tax does not increase or add to property
taxes paid by Burbank property owners.

The current tax rate is 10% of the parking fee. This measure would amend
Section 14-1903 of the Burbank Municipal Code to allow the City Council to
increase the tax up to a maximum of 12%, after a public hearing on the matter.
If this measure passes, the City Council could adjust the rate of the tax from
time to time, but can never increase the tax above the 12% cap without
additional voter approval.

The revenues from the tax are available for general, local purposes including,
but not limited to, fire protection, law enforcement, parks, libraries, criminal
prosecution, capital improvements and other authorized uses.

If a majority of the votes cast on this ballot measure are "Yes", this measure will
be approved, allowing the City Council to increase the tax rate up to a
maximum of 12%. If a majority of the votes on this measure are "No", the
measure will not be approved, and the transient parking tax will continue to be
collected at the existing rate of 10%.

The above statement is an Impartial Analysis of Measure N. If you
desire, a copy of the full text of Ordinance No. 3612 is available in
the Office of the City Clerk at 818/238-5851, and a copy will be
mailed at no cost to you.
