June 1990

Dear Property Owner:

On April 10, 1990, voters in the Reed Union School District approved a special
school tax with a 73.3% "yes1’ vote to maintain educational programs for our
students.

The approved measure authorizes the School District to tax each taxable parcel $96
per year for the next 5 years. This tax will be included in the real property tax
bills mailed out in November, 1990, and will be payable with the other reed, property
taxes in two installments of $48 each on December 10 and April 10 of each of the
next 5 years.

Homeowners who have attained the age 65 prior to June 1 of each applicable year and
are beneficial owners (either spouse) of a parcel that is their principal place of
residence, are eligible to apply to the Board of Trustees for an exemption to the
parcel tax. Each such exemption shall continue for each year the applicant remains
eligible, without the need for re application.

It is possible you may live on a lot which includes one or more assessor's parcels.
Exemptions will also be available for owners of multiple parcels if the parcels are
contiguous or in one ecomonic unit, and the parcels are not separate and distinct
properties that can be independently developed or sold. Each such exemption shall
continue for each year the parcels remain eligible, without the need, for
reapplication.

If you think you may qualify for either of the above exemptions and choose to apply,
fill in the proper enclosed application immediately and mail it to the address at
the top of the form. The deadline for applying for the exemption from the first
year of the tax is August 15, 1990, and July 1 of any succeeding year the tax will
be in effect. Senior citizens who have already applied for the exemption need not

apply again. For further information call the District Office at 381-1284.

The funds raised from Measure A will be used to assure the continuance of an
outstanding educational program. These monies are in fact an investment in the
future for our children and our caununity.
