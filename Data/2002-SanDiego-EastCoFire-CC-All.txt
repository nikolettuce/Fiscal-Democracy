ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION CC

When someone in Crest or Bostonia needs a paramedic they don't have fifteen minutes to wait.
Vote YES on Measure CC to put paramedics where they need to be when they need to be there.

Today, when one of our neighbors requires life saving paramedic services, a Paramedic
ambulance must travel from another fire district. While our local fire company can respond to
emergencies in five minutes, the paramedics traveling from surrounding districts take up to 15
minutes to arrive.

Measure CC will reduce emergency response times and save lives by providing paramedic
services with our local fire companies, rather than relying on outside fire districts to respond to
medical emergencies.

Measure CC will:

•	Add a professionally trained paramedic firefighter to each fire company, thereby
reducing emergency response times by as much as ten minutes and improving fire
safety.

•	Every penny raised by this measure will stay in our community and may only be used.for
the specific purpose of adding paramedic firefighters to our engine companies.

“We can trust the East County Fire Protection District to use our tax funds efficiently and wisely.
Dollar for dollar, the District provides higher levels of service at lower costs than any other
fire district in our region.”

Despite a budget far smaller than surrounding fire districts, our district has provided exceptional
service. Our residents deserve the same emergency medical service levels received in
surrounding districts. We can trust our fire district to provide these services professionally,
efficiently and promptly.

By law, Measure CC funds may ONLY be used to maintain and enhance paramedic and fire safely
services in the communities of Crest and Bostonia.

Measure CC is endorsed by:

•	Our Firefighters,

•	All of our elected Fire District Board Members,

•	Fire Chief Darrell Jobes

•	Hundreds of business, community, senior and mobilehome resident leaders.
