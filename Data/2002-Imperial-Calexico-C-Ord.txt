Section 5. Findings. The people of the City of Calexico fmd as follows:

(a)	On August 4, 1992, the City Council adopted Ordinance No. 923 to
increase the rate of the transient occupancy tax. In the early 1990's the Legislature
balanced the State budget by taking property taxes away from cities. Since 1991 the State
has taken large amounts of property taxes from Calexico. In 2000 alone, this loss to the
City was $434,210.26. This general tax provides 2.2% of the City's General Fund and is
used to pay for general City services, primarily police and fire services.
