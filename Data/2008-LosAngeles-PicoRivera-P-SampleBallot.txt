The City of Pico Rivera like many other cities in Los Angeles County imposes a
general transactions and use tax (sales tax). The existing sales tax generates
revenues that are used to provide public services such as police and fire
protection, parks and recreation, library, public works, and other city programs
and services.

If adopted, Measure “P” will amend the provisions of the Pico Rivera City Code
to assess an additional one percent (1%) sales tax to fund general city services,
such as the hiring of additional police officers, fix and repair the condition of
neighborhood streets and major roads and highways, continue the effort to fight
gangs and drugs by expanding neighborhood graffiti removal programs, and
appropriate funds for the creation of youth anti-gang and anti-drug prevention
programs and after-school tutoring and mentoring programs. If adopted, the
funds generated will also be able to be used to be added to monies pledged by
the County of Los Angeles to assist in the construction of a high-tech community
library for the City of Pico Rivera.

The financial impact of this Measure, if approved, would add a one cent increase
for every dollar spent in Pico Rivera. Under California law, this one penny could
not be charged on prescriptions or food purchased as groceries.

A “Yes” vote on Measure “P” supports imposing a one percent (1%) sales tax to
generate funds for general city services. A “No” vote on Measure “P” will
maintain the current level of the sales tax and no additional revenues will be
generated to continue or expand on existing public services.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE P

Pico Rivera is facing a fiscal crisis due to severe impacts from nation-wide
inflation, California’s $16 billion budget deficit and bad redevelopment deals.
We need Measure P!

Our determined efforts to transform this city from the ravages of gangs, violent
crime, graffiti and constant fiscal instability have already produced impressive
results. Crime is at an all-time low and we’re rated among the safest
communities in the region!

Today—as never before, you see:

The most aggressive graffiti abatement anywhere.

Street resurfacing and infrastructure improvements city-wide.

Significant new commercial development and job growth.

Parks and neighborhood improvements.

Pico Rivera is now a more desirable location for economic development.
Property values remain higher. Families and Businesses are safer and more
secure!

Measure P will protect vital services residents expect and deserve. One-penny
per dollar spent will not increase costs for food purchased as groceries,
prescription medicine, rent, mortgages, utilities, personal services, or even movie
tickets!

With Measure P, our community’s vision for a safer, cleaner, smarter and more
fiscally sound City will bring:

Maximum law enforcement results for public safety.

Completion of our long-awaited Parks Master Plan.

Newly repaired, cleaner and safer city streets and alleyways.

A new high-tech County Library that is urgently needed for our youth.

Strong financial reserves to protect our City long into the future.

The tremendous progress made in recent years, with dramatic decreases in
crime, gangs and graffiti, has earned our continued support. New commercial
and entertainment centers have brought prestige, financial growth and new
employment opportunities for our residents.
