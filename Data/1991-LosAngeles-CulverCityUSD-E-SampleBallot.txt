ANALYSIS OF PROPOSITION E

By D«Witt W. Clinton, County Counsel

Approval of this ballot measure would allow the Culver City Unified School
District to impose a special tax of up to $98 per year on all real property within
the School District commencing July I, 1992.

The precise amount of the tax would be determined each year by the Board
of Education following a public hearing. The maximum permissible yearly tax
of $98 authorized by this measure may not be exceeded by the Board in any
year in which the tax is assessed, but may be lower. The tax would be levied
for a maximum five-year period, but may be less.

Taxpayers 65 years of age or older who own and occupy single parcels will,
upon application, be granted an exemption from the tax and receive a rebate
upon proof of age and payment, and certification of occupancy. Taxpayers
whose primary residence is located on a multi-parcel lot will, upon appeal,
be granted a rebate on all but one parcel of the lot on which the primary resi-
dence is located.

The tax would be used to restore underfunded educational programs and to
provide competitive salaries for District employees.

The approval of this measure would also allow the District to increase the legal
ceiling on expenditures currently imposed by the State Constitution. This
increase in the ceiling is limited to four (4) years, without additional voter
approval.

A two-thirds vote is required for passage of the measure.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION E

Our Schools are the heart of Culver City’s exceptional quality of life. We expect
quality teachers and educational excellence; but today the schools face a finan-
cial crisis.

Proposition E will meet the crisis and bring Culver schools up to the standards
our students need.

Culver schools have lived within tight budgets before without requesting new
taxes. However, the double blows of recession and declining enrollment hit
last year, and the schools spent all their reserves.

This year, funding from the State has been cut again, and with no reserves,
the District was forced to cut teachers, staff and programs.

Vital programs which keep students out of gangs and prevent dropouts were
cut. Security staff is reduced. Some children will not even receive adequate
reading instruction. Proposition E will restore programs and help retain quality
teachers and staff for the future.

Private donations from local companies and friends of the schools are helpful,
but not enough. No state or local funding alternatives exist to help the schools
except a parcel tax.

Meanwhile, Culver students in the 1991-92 school year are getting short-
changed on their education.

Proposition E assesses a 27 cents a day parcel tax which totals $98 annually.
It is a temporary, emergency school tax which ends after four years. Every dol-
lar stays in Culver City. State politicians can’t bargain these funds away in
some back room deal.

Proposition E will give the schools a chance to recover. If it fails, this year’s
cutbacks will become permanent, victimizing not only our children but our
entire community.

SENIORS, 65 YEARS AND OVER, CAN EXEMPT THEMSELVES
FROM THE PARCEL TAX BY PROVIDING PROOF OF THEIR AGE
AND A TAX RECEIPT.
