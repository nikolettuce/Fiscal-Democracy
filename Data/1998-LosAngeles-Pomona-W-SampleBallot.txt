CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE W

Measure W is a proposed Ordinance which would establish a Special Tax for Parks
and Recreation Services. In order to impose the Special Tax, voter approval must
be obtained from the qualified electors of Pomona.

Currently, no Special Tax for parks and recreation services exist in the City of
Pomona. If approved, the tax would provide for: (1) the establishment and
enhancement of recreation programs; (2) the establishment of a Park and Tree
Maintenance fund; (3) the establishment of a Capital Improvement Program; and
(4) the purchase of equipment and construction of improvements among several
City of Pomona parks.

The Special Tax is anticipated to generate $2.2 million as a maximum and the
ordinance empowers the City Council to establish the actual tax levy each fiscal
year in amounts below the maximum.

The proposed tax rates are determined based on land use. Single Family
Residential (SFR) parcels are proposed to be taxed on a dwelling unit basis.
Mobile Homes and vacant single family lots would be taxed at 50% of a SFR. The
proposed rates for non-residential parcels, such as commercial and industrial
properties, are based on parcel acreage, with six dwelling units equivalent to one
parcel acre, and with a maximum of five acres. Vacant non-residential parcels are
proposed to be taxed at 50% of the non-residential rate.

Single—Family Residential (Including condo units)

$47.00 per dwelling unit for each developed parcel

j Multiple Family Residential

|	$47.00	per dwelling unit for each developed parcel

Mobile Home Residential

$23.50 per dwelling unit for each developed parcel

I'he proposed Special Tax would be imposed on each parcel of property, and the
i.ix shall not be measured by the value of the property. I'he Special Tax is
proposed to be collected by the Los Angeles County Assessor in the same manner
and dates as property taxes are collected.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE W

Vote Yes for improved and expanded Parks and Recreation services in Pomona!
Vote Yes for our children!

MORE RECREATION SERVICES FOR OUR KIDS— Teens and children
comprise 40% of our population. A YES vote will provide additional
community programs and special events for Pomona’s youth.

SAFER PARKS — Park Security Patrol for all Pomona parks will be improved.

VETERANS PARK — This measure will provide funding to assist with
development of a state-of-the-art regional recreation facility on the former
General Dynamics site and include an improved gymnasium and new multi-
purpose complex.

BETTER SERVICE TO SENIOR CITIZENS AND FAMILIES — Automated
telephone registration and reservations will be installed for quicker response
to citizens, eliminating unnecessary trips for registration and sign-ups.

HELP FOR YOUTH SPORTS PROGRAMS— Your support for Measure W
will establish improved field maintenance, renovation and preparation of all
City athletic fields used for youth sports.

- REDUCE FIRE HAZARDS — A special maintenance crew will be created to
clear brush, plant trees, and upgrade watering systems in Ganesha Park hills.

IMPROVE OUR PARKS — A YES vote will provide funds for much needed
improvements to parks throughout all of Pomona.

The benefits of Measure W are far reaching and for everyone! Due to recent
budget constraints, many recreational activities and programs have been
substantially reduced and park improvements have been deferred. This is your
chance to add much needed recreational services for our youth and seniors, and
to make upgrades and improvements where they are most needed. This is where
all Pomona residents will receive the most direct benefit.

The average residential parcel will pay less than $1 per week to improve our parks
and recreational services for all families in Pomona!

Vote Yes for more recreation programs for our kids!

Vote Yes for safer and better parks!

EDWARD S. CORTEZ, Mayor City of Pomona

WILLIE WHITE, City Councilmember City of Pomona
