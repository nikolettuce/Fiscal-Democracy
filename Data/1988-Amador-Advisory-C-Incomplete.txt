MEASURES SUBMITTED TO VOTE OF VOTERS

COUNTY		
Advisory Vote Only  A Over the past several years counties have been forced to make Ft reductions in local services to pay for the increasing costs of state- mandated programs. The state has underfunded or, in some cases, not funded these programs at all. At the same time, the ability of county voters to control local spending has been greatly reduced. Therefore, the voters of Ainador County petition the Legislature to enact a law which would dedicate an additional 1/4 cent of the current State sales taxes generated in the county to provide a stable source of funding for county services. We also request that the state honor its statutory and constitutional responsibilities by fully funding all mandated programs it imposes on local governments.	YES  NO	1196*  1197*
