One time bond of up to fifteen billion dollars ($15,000,000,000) to retire deficit. Fiscal Impact: One-time increase, compared to previously authorized bond, of up to $4 billion  to reduce the state’s budget shortfall and annual debt-service savings over the next few years.

Fiscal Impact: Net state fiscal effects unknown and will vary by year, depending in part on actions of future legislatures.

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS FOR MEASURE H

Present law within the City of Susanville provides that each transient,
traveler or guest who stays at a hotel, motel, or recreational vehicle
(RV) park within the city limits of Susanville must pay a tax on the amount
of rent charged by the operator of the hotel or motel or RV park. This is
called a Transient Occupancy Tax, or TOT. The TOT presently in effect
in the City of Susanville is at the rate of eight percent (8%). This rate
has been in effect since 1989. The tax is collected by the owner or
operator of the hotel, motel or RV park, and turned over to the City of
Susanville, usually quarterly.

This measure seeks to amend Section 4.30.404 of the Susanville
Municipal Code to increase the Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT to ten
percent (10%, effective as of July 1, 2004.

Approval of this measure will increase the TOT rate within the City of
Susanville from eight percent (8%) to ten percent (10%), effective July
1,2004.

Failure of this measure will result in no increase in the TOT rate within
the City of Susanville, and the TOT within the City of Susanville will
remain at eight percent (8%).

A general tax, such as the Transient Occupancy Tax, requires a majority
vote and is imposed for general governmental purposes.

To be approved, this measure must receive the favorable vote of at
least a majority of the voters voting on it.

KATHLEEN R. LAZARD, CITY ATTORNEY

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE H

The City of Susanville supports an increase in the Transient Occupancy
Tax (TOT), or room tax, in the City of Susanville, from 8% to 10%. This
is a pass-through tax that is paid by travelers who stay in hotels, motels
and RV parks. This is not a tax charged to the hotel, motel or RV park
owners. This is not a tax paid by the residents of the City. This tax will
not increase the base room rate charged in the City. The TOT tax is
deposited to the General Fund. The General Fund is used to promote
tourism, civic promotions, public safety, police services, fire protection
education and enforcement and other City services. The increase cannot
be used for any of the City’s enterprise funds, such as natural gas or
water services.

TOTs in the surrounding areas: 10% in Lassen County, Alturas,
Anderson, Redding, Red Bluff, and Chico; 13.5% in Reno, 11% in
Sparks, and 12% in Sacramento. The City’s TOT was increased from
6% to 8% in 1989 with no loss in hotel/motel/RV park revenues, which
have steadily increased since that time. Increases in TOT have not
negatively impacted occupancy rates in local hotels or in other cities. It
is forecast that an additional $40,000 will be generated between
07/01/04 and 12/31/04 and $80,000 during calendar year 2005.

We urge you to vote YES on Measure H. At a time when City operating
costs are escalating due to the workers' compensation, liability and
property insurance costs and revenues are being withheld by state
legislators in Sacramento, it is necessary to promote tourism and trade
in our community, while preserving essential municipal services. Let
those who travel and take advantage of our local services help to pay
for them.
