IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL

DATED: August 26, 1992	DOUGLAS	J.	MALONEY

County Counsel

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE Q

As a result of the State's handling of the current budget crisis, It appears that the Bolinas Fire Protection
District will lose $34,764 per year in Special District Augmentation Funds. This represents approximately
one eighth of our budget. At this time it is unknown whether other revenue also will be lost. This
measure, which will be enacted only if the revenue actually is taken from us, will raise approximately
$31,000, or 89%, of the lost funding.

The District has already tightened its belt and deferred projects in order to stay within our budget limits,
so passage of this measure Is critical tor maintenance of the existing level of service. Apparatus,
equipment, and even the firehouse, itself, need to be maintained and, In some cases replaced.

The Bolinas Fire Department responds to over two hundred emergency calls per year. Our volunteers
provide first response emergency medical care In the community, the paramedics being approximately
twenty minutes away in Point Reyes Station, and, of course, provide both structure and wildland fire
protection as well. Both the taw and common sense require that the volunteer firefighters have adequate
apparatus and personal safety equipment to properly handle these emergencies.

Please be sure to vote. This measure must be approved by two-tthlrds of the voters so your vote is

Important

Remember: THIS MEASURE IS ONLY TO REPLACE FUNDING TAKEN BY THE STATE.

IT WILL NOT BE ENACTED IF THE STATE DOES NOT TAKE OUR MONEY.

THE FUNDING IS CRITICAL TO MAINTAIN THE EXISTING LEVEL OF SERVICE.

Thank you for your support
