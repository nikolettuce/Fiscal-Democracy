Measure Q

Essential Services Measure
City of Concord

To continue funding that cannot be taken by the State to protect/maintain Concord's city
services, including 911 response, police officers, gang prevention, crime investigation,
neighborhood police patrols, city street/pothole repair, senior/youth programs, other city
services, shall the City of Concord extend the existing voter-approved V2 cent sales tax for 9
years only, without increasing the current tax rate, including annual audits, independent
citizens oversight, and no money for Sacramento?

Impartial Analysis from City Attorney

The City Council has placed before the voters the question of whether to approve an ordinance
amending the expiration date of an existing sales tax in Concord. Measure Q proposes to extend
for nine years the existing half cent (0.5%) sales tax, which was approved by a majority of the
voters in November, 2010 and took effect in April, 2011. Voter approval of Measure Q will
extend the collection of the sales tax until 2025.

Currently, the tax on retail sales in Concord is 9.00% of the purchase price. The City receives
1.25% of the sales tax. The remainder goes to the State (6.50%), Contra Costa County (0.25%),
the Contra Costa Transportation Authority (0.50%), and BART (0.50%).

Technically, the existing "sales tax" is a combination of "sales and use tax" and "transactions and
use tax." Both are levied on the sale or use of tangible personal property sold at retail, with
certain limited exceptions. Retailers collect the tax at the time of sale and remit funds to the State
Board of Equalization, which administers the tax.

This measure would authorize the continuance of a half cent (0.50%) transactions and use tax for
an additional nine years, but would not increase the total 9.0% sales tax that is currently assessed
in Concord. Of that 9.0% amount, 1.25% would be deposited in the City's general fund and
would be available to support the full range of municipal services. Because this measure does not
legally restrict the use of tax revenue to any specific purpose, it is classified as a "general tax,"
and not a "special tax." The tax proceeds may be used for any valid governmental purposes,
including but not limited to neighborhood police patrols, 911 response, gang prevention
programs, street maintenance and pothole repairs, senior services, and youth sports/recreation
programs. The State would be restricted from using the half cent (0.50%) sales tax pursuant to
Proposition 1 A, adopted by California voters in 2004.

The tax extension authorized by this measure would automatically terminate nine years after it
becomes operative, unless terminated earlier by a unanimous vote of the City Council. Upon
termination, the total sales tax rate in Concord would be 8.5%.

This measure requires the City's independent auditors to prepare a publicly available report on
the collection, management and expenditure of revenue from the tax. Additionally, it requires the

City Council to appoint an oversight committee consisting of at least five members of the public
to review and report on the receipt of revenue and expenditures of funds from the tax. The
committee's report and recommendations are a public record and must be considered by the
Council at a public meeting as part of the annual budget process.

A "Yes" vote is a vote in favor of the sales tax extension. A "No" vote is a vote against the sales
tax extension. The measure will be approved if it receives a simple majority of "Yes" votes.

Arguments For Measure Q

Vote YES on Q + Protect our community
services, without raising tax rates!

YES on Q does not create a new tax. It simply
continues an existing, voter-approved local
sales tax that the City has relied on since 2010
— at the same tax rate. This essential funding
has helped Concord stay solvent, maintain
services and rebuild its emergency reserves.

Sacramento politicians have taken nearly $80
Million from our City over the past 20 years!
Concord needs locally-controlled funds for
our projects and services, with money that
can't be taken by the State.

YES on Q WON'T raise your tax rates

YES on Q maintains 911 Emergency
Response and Neighborhood Police Patrols

YES on Q maintains Gang Prevention and
Crime Investigation Services

YES on Q maintains City Streets and Pothole
Repair

YES on Q maintains senior services and
youth and teen programs

All Measure Q money must be spent on our
LOCAL services and Sacramento can't touch
it! YES on Q protects these essential city
services by maintaining Concord's financial
stability and viability, with local funding that
cannot be taken for Sacramento agendas.

YES on Q maintains Concord's after-school
programs, anti-gang activities, and recreation
programs that keep our youth and teens off
the streets, out of trouble and away from
drugs and gangs.

YES on Q includes strong fiscal
accountability, with Citizens' Oversight,
mandatory annual financial audits and yearly
reports to the community to monitor
spending—guaranteeing funds are spent
responsibly and as promised. By law, it is
required to expire in 9 years unless extended
by voters.

Join a unanimous Mayor and City Council,
police officers, firefighters, local business
owners, and community leaders in voting
YES on Q to protect and maintain Concord's
high-quality services without raising taxes.

WHEREAS, in November 2010, the voters of Concord adopted a local revenue measure
("Measure Q"), to mitigate cuts to local services caused by State takeaways and the Great
Recession; and

WHEREAS, Measure Q established a general transactions and use tax ("sales tax") of one-half
of one percent (0.5%), which is codified at Title 3 (Revenue and Finance), Chapter 3.15

WHEREAS, at a public hearing on July 29, 2014, the Council considered placing a measure on
the ballot for the November 4, 2014 General Election seek voter approval of an extension of
Measure Q; and

WHEREAS, after that hearing, the City Council concluded that all of the information presented

should ask the voters of the City to approve a 9-year extension of Measure Q, continuing the
current assessment of a local transactions and use tax, the revenue from which could be used to
support general municipal services; and

WHEREAS, on the basis of the foregoing, the City Council, by adopting Resolution 14-62,
determined that it was appropriate to place a measure before the voters at the November 4, 2014
general election regarding a 9 year extension of the general transactions and use (sales) tax

continue to be one-half of one percent (0.5%) (a half cent for each dollar) of the sales price of
the property. The tax revenue would continue to be collected by the State Board of Equalization

affirmative votes (50% plus 1 vote).

contained in pt. 1.6 of div. 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, (c) To adopt a retail
transactions and use tax ordinance that imposes a tax and provides a measure therefore that can
be administered and collected by the State Board of Equalization in a manner that adapts itself

and administrative procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in administering and
collecting the California State Sales and Use Taxes, (d) To adopt a retail transactions and use
tax ordinance that can be administered in a manner that will be, to the greatest degree possible,
consistent with the provisions of pt. 1.6 of div. 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize

WHEREAS, Measure Q established a general transactions and use tax (“sales tax”) of one-
half of one percent (as authorized by Revenue and Taxation Code section 7285.9), which is codified at
Chapter 3, Article V, Sections 3.15.360 through 3.15.500 of the Concord Municipal Code; and

WHEREAS, although the revenues raised by Measure Q have helped the City stay solvent
during the period since it was adopted, Measure Q is scheduled to expire; and

WHEREAS, the City’s 10-Year Financial Forecast estimates that if Measure Q expires,
commencing in Fiscal Year 2016-17, $4 million in annual budget reductions will be required to
address the decline in City revenues currently received from Measure Q, which in turn will require the
City to make severe cuts to the services it currently provides, adversely affecting public safety
services including 9-1-1 emergency response times, police officers, gang prevention and crime
investigation services, and neighborhood police patrols, along with other City services, such as road
maintenance, youth sports and recreation programs, city parks and playgrounds, and senior services
and the Senior Center; and

WHEREAS, the extension of the sales tax initially authorized under Measure Q would ensure
fiscal accountability by requiring independent citizens oversight, mandatory financial audits, and
yearly reports to the community; and

WHEREAS, at its June 24,2014 meeting, the City Council adopted a budget for Fiscal Year
2014-15 that recognized the need for maintaining the revenue currently provided by Measure Q to
continue and preserve the level of services desired by residents of the City; and

WHEREAS, at a public hearing on July 29,2014, the Council considered placing a measure
on the ballot for the November 4, 2014 General Election seek voter approval of an extension of the
existing general transactions and use tax (“sales tax”) initially authorized by Concord voters as
Measure Q, extending that sales tax for a period of an additional 9 years, with no increase in the sales
tax that residents currently pay; and

WHEREAS, after that hearing, the City Council concluded that all of the information
presented indicated that, to obtain the revenue necessary to maintain and preserve service levels, the
Council should, at the November 4,2014 General Election, ask the voters of the City to approve a 9
year extension of the current one-half of one percent (.05%) local transactions and use tax initially

authorized under Measure Q, the revenue from which could be used to support general municipal
services and could not be taken away by the State; and

WHEREAS, on the basis of the foregoing, the City Council determined that it was appropriate
to place a measure before the voters at the November 4, 2014 general election regarding the extension
the current general transactions and use (sales) tax initially authorized by Measure Q; and

WHEREAS, the tax, if approved, would continue to be imposed on the sale of tangible
personal property and the storage, use, or other consumption of such property. The tax rate would
continue to be one-half of one percent (0.5%) (a half cent for each dollar) of the sales price^of the
property. The tax revenue would be continue to be collected by the State Board of Equalization and
remitted to the City. The tax extension would be in effect for 9 years, and would then expire
automatically. The tax shall be approved if the measure receives at least a simple majority of
affirmative votes; and

WHEREAS, the Concord City Council is authorized by California Elections Code Section
9222 to place measures before the voters; and

WHEREAS, Elections Code Sections 9281 through 9287 set forth the procedures for primary
arguments in favor of and in opposition to any City measure and for rebuttal arguments; and

WHEREAS, on May 27, 2014, the City Council adopted Resolution No. 14-31, calling for the
City’s General Municipal Election to be held on the same day as and consolidated with the Statewide

Section 11. The approval of this Resolution is exempt from the California Environmental
Quality Act (Public Resources Code §§ 21000 et seq., “CEQA,” and 14 Cal. Code Reg. §§ 15000 et
seq., “CEQA Guidelines”). The transactions and use tax to be submitted to the voters is a general tax
that can be used for any legitimate governmental purpose; to issue it is not a commitment to any
particular action. As such, under CEQA Guidelines section 15378(b)(4), the tax is not a project within
the meaning of CEQA because it creates a government funding mechanism that does not involve any
commitment to any specific project that may result in a potentially significant physical impact on the
environment. If revenue from the tax were used for a purpose that would have either such effect, the
city would undertake the required CEQA review for that particular project. Therefore, under CEQA
Guidelines section 15060 review under CEQA is not required.

Section 12. This Resolution shall become effective immediately upon its passage and
adoption.

PASSED AND ADOPTED by the City Council of the City of Concord on July 29, 2014, by
