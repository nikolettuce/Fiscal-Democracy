IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL
CONTINUATION OF SPECIAL TAX TO SUPPORT
TAHOE TRUCKEE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT
MEASURE S

This analysis of the measure to continue the special tax for the Tahoe Truckee
Unified School District is prepared and submitted to the voters in accordance with
section 5321 of the Elections Code.

Government Code sections 50075-500?? and 50079 together with Article XIIIA and B
of the California Constitution authorize school districts to submit to the voters for
approval or rejection a measure authorizing the levy of a special tax and changing
the appropriations limit of the District.

If two-thirds of the qualified electors voting on the measure vote for approval, the
Board of Trustees of the Tahoe Truckee Unified School District will be authorized to
continue to levy the special tax of $48 per year assessed per assessor's parcel upon
parcels of real property located within the boundaries of the Tahoe Truckee Unified
School District which was first approved on March 7,1989. Tax payers 65 years of
age or older who own parcels otherwise subject to the tax, will be entitled to an
exemption from the special tax subject to submitting proof of entitlement to the
exemption pursuant to rules and regulations adopted by the Governing 8oard of the
School District. This special tax will be authorized to continue in effect for a maxi-
mum period of four years and the proceeds thereof shall only be used for the purpos-
es as set forth in paragraph 8 of Resolution No. 11-92/93 adopted by the Governing
Board of the Tahoe Truckee Unified School District on October 26,1992 as follows:

(a) The continued provision of instructional supplies and equipment needed to
bring each school site in line with state standards;

fb) The continued enhancement of academic programs, such as college prepara-
tory courses and G.A.T.E. programs, by providing certificated employees and acquir-
ing necessary instructional supplies and equipment;

(c)	The continued enhancement of vocational education curriculum by updating
the equipment and maintaining programs and classes that address local vocational
education needs;

(d)	The maintenance and establishment of computer laboratories and computer
literacy curriculum at each school, properly staffed by personnel qualified to teach
computer literacy;

(e)	The continued replacement of school buses not meeting state standards and
the purchase of new vehicles to meet the transportation needs of the District:

(f)	The continued staffing of the Tahoe Truckee High School and North Tahoe
High School libraries with certificated librarians, the continued acquisition of library
books and equipment for all school sites, the maintenance of a reserve fund for
library maintenance, and the continued enrollment in the County Educational Media
Program;

(g)	The continued staffing of the elementary and intermediate schools with music
teachers, at least one for each site of the District, along with music supplies and
equipment maintenance;

(h)	The continued employment of at least one full-time nurse, and the continued
acquisition of necessary equipment, supplies and testing materials to enable screen-
ing, testing and caring for pupils as required by state law and to support drug and
alcohol abuse programs, the maintenance of safe school grounds and playing fields
to insure student safety;

{i) The continued maintenance of physical education programs in the elementary
schools, and the acquisition of necessary equipment and supplies at school sites;

(j) The continued employment of counselors and the hiring of special sendee per-
sonnel as needed at school sites.	*

If the measure passes, the appropriations limit of the District will be increased for a
period of four years from July 1,1993, in an amount equal to the revenue raised by
the special tax.

If two-thirds of the qualified electors voting on the measure do not vote for approval,
the measure will fail and the proposed special tax will not be levied.

The electors who will be entitled to vote on the measure will be those qualified
electors who reside within the boundaries of the Tahoe Truckee Unified School
District.

This special tax has no effect on the existing law other than as described above.

Placer County Counsel

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE "S“

For the past four years Measure S has been the difference between "just ade-
quate’ education and an 'excellent' education for our school children. A ’Yes" vote
on Measure S will renew local commitment to quality education.

California State budget deficits have resulted in cutbacks in funding for education.
Many school districts across the state have been forced to eliminate all but the
most basic programs and defer funding of equipment, supplies, or maintenance.

Without State money we must look to local sources for funding. Developer fees,
plus the passage last year of Measure D, will fund the District's construction needs.
Measure S parcel tax will continue to fund the District’s program needs:

*	Academic programs

•	Vocational education

•	Bus replacement

♦	School counselors

♦	Nursing services

•	Classroom equipment and supplies

•	Computer labs and qualified staff

•	Elementary & intermediate music

•	Libraries and high school librarians

•	Elementary physical education

Measure S was written with both students end taxpayers in mind. The

amount of the tax ($48 per year) will remain the same as when Measure S was first
passed four years ago. Funds from Measure S will be legally earmarked for specific
programs. District spending will continue to be monitored by a citizen's review com-
mittee. The parcel tax would commence on July 1,1993 and would be up for voter
renewal in four years. Finally, as a protection for senior citizens, exemptions for
those over the age of 65 will be retained.

We recognize that even $4 per month can be a sacrifice. But we believe that ensur-
ing quality in our children's education and in our community is a worthy sacrifice.
Please join parents, teachers, community leaders, senior citizens and taxpayers in
local support for local schools. PLEASE VOTE YES ON MEASURE S.
