<impartial> IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL
RAIL AND MASS TRANSIT IMPROVEMENTS
MEASURE A

If this measure is approved, by a majority of the votes cast on this
proposition, a portion of existing motor vehicle revenue, now collected
and allocated statewide, may be used by Placer County for public mass
transit facilities and related purposes, in accordance with Article XIX of
the California Constitution. <impartialend>

<favor> ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF
MEASURE A

Measure A will not increase your taxes. This measure will simply
guarantee that a portion of the taxes you now pay will be used for rail
transportation projects in Placer County. These projects could include
commuter rail, light rail, or improvements to the Amtrak rail line.
Measure A will not affect the amount of highway funds Placer County
receives.

There are currently nineteen counties receiving a share of existing
motor vehicle revenue set aside for rail transit. Measure A, if approved
by the voters, will allow Placer County to receive its fair share of these
revenues, rather than these funds going to other counties. Why should
we pay taxes and not get the same benefits as other taxpayers through-
out the State?

If Measure A is not approved, Placer County residents will continue to
pay the same fuel taxes, but we will not receive our fair share of those
taxes. <favorend>
