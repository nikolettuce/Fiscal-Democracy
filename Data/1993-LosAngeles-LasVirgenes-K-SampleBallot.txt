ANALYSIS OF PROPOSITION K
By DeWitt W. Clinton, County Counsel

Approval of this measure would allow the Las Virgenes Unified School
District to impose a special tax of $150 per year upon each parcel of real
property located wholly or partially within the District. The tax would be
levied for a four-year period.

Taxpayers 65 years of age or older who own and occupy single residential
parcels shall be granted an exemption from the special tax upon application to
the Governing Board of the District. Taxpayers who own and occupy
contiguous parcels held under identical ownership and used for single residen-
tial purposes may, upon application to the Board, have such parcels treated as
a single parcel for purposes of the special tax.

The tax would be used to restore budget cuts, reduce class size, add a seventh
period at the middle school, add an elective seventh period of not less than 40
classes at the high school, add specialists at the elementary school (e.g., music,
art, physical education, computer), and further reduce class size if remaining
funds are available. Proceeds of the special tax may not be used to fund
general salary increases, administrative salaries, or other programs or reduc-
tions. If the Board determines that the funds collected will not be needed for
appropriate purposes during the duration of this measure, such funds will be
returned to the taxpayers.

The Board shall annually require and make public an independent audit of the
funds collected by the special tax and the expenditures of such funds. The cost
of the audit shall be funded by the special tax.

A two-thirds (2/3) vote is required for passage of the measure.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Proposition K. If you wish a
copy of the full text of the measure, please call the Las Virgenes Unified
School District Office at (818) 880-4U00 Ext. 203 and a copy will be mailed at

no cost to you.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION K

_ community and children have reaped the benefits of a nationally recognized
school system. People move here because of our schools. Property values are higher
because of our schools. Diminished state funding places us at a crossroads. We can
take back local control to reverse the erosion of Las Virgenes schools. Or, we can
do nothing and accept that the mediocrity evident elsewhere will jeopardize our
children and our property values.

Proposition K will place a LIMITED TERM parcel tax on every parcel in our
District. It will cost 41 cents a day ($150 annually) per parcel and is equally applied
as Proposition 13 requires. It will provide over S3 million directly to our children.

Proposition K will provide Las Virgenes Schools:

—	SMALLER CLASSES (California has the second largest class sizes in the
nation. Recent cutbacks forced many classes over 40 per class!)

—	MORE CLASSES (It will restore elective classes at the middle and high
school level.)

—	ELEMENTARY SPECIALISTS (Proposition K will provide regular instruction
in areas such as music, art, P.E. and/or computer to our elementary students.)

—	INCREASED DESIRABILITY thereby further enhancing our property values.

ikLuraanii:

WILL NOT raise salaries

WILL NOT pay for administrators or increase bureaucracy.

WILL NOT tax senior citizens.

WILL NOT go to the state. It stays in Las Virgenes schools or it cannot be collected
WILL NOT last forever. It is limited to four years.

In 1992, Prop K garnered support from local papers, chambers of commerce, and
homeowners associations. It missed by less than 2Vo.

The L.A. Times said Prop K was “reasonable” and that its defeat, despite an over-
whelming 64Vo “yes" vote, was “incredible-and wrong.” Our children cannot
afford a repeat of that mistake. Prop K will put us back on the road to local control.
VOTE YES FOR OUR KIDS.
