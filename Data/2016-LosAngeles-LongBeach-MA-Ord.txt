lower tax rate, as defined in such ordinance, subject to the maximum rates set forth
in C.l., C.2., C.4. and C.5. City Council may subsequently in its discretion at any
time by ordinance implement a higher tax rate, subject to the maximum rates set forth

($1,000.00) annually.

D.	Modification, Repeal or Amendment.

subsequently reenact it without voter approval, as long as the reenacted ordinance or Section does
not result in an increase in the tax or taxes beyond the maximum rate or methodology imposed
herein.

E.	Annual Adjustment.

The taxes imposed by paragraph C.5 shall be adjusted annually by the Director of Financial
Management. Beginning on October 1, 2018, and on October 1 of each succeeding year thereafter,
the amount of each tax imposed by paragraph C.5 shall be adjusted equivalent to the most recent
change in the annual average of the Consumer Price Index ("CPI") for all urban consumers in the
Los Angeles-Riverside-Orange County areas as published by the United States Government Bureau
of Labor Statistics; however no adjustment shall decrease any tax imposed by paragraph C.5. For
the purposes of calculating the annual adjustment factor under paragraph C.5, the base year shall be
that year ending with December 31, 2016. Rates shall next be adjusted on October 1, 2018, and
annually thereafter, based on the annually calculated change from the base year. The October 1,
2018, adjustment shall be the change in the average CPI for the year ending December 31, 2017,
compared to the base year ending December 31, 2016.

F.	Administration.

The City Manager, or designee, and/or the City Council by ordinance, may promulgate
regulations to implement and administer this Section including, but not limited to regulations
allowing Marijuana Businesses to report and or remit taxes more or less frequently than monthly.
The City Manager shall provide no less than annually a report to the City Council detailing annual
expenditures.

G.	Reporting and Remittance.

In order to aid in the City's collection of taxes due under this Section and to ensure that all
Marijuana Businesses are taxed consistently to the best of the City's ability, beginning as set forth
in Section K, below, and monthly thereafter, each Marijuana Business shall report to the City any
Gross Receipts received during the reporting period and shall likewise remit to the City the taxes
due and owing during said period. For purposes of this Section, taxes shall begin to accrue on the
date that a person or entity first receives a business license or other permit to operate as a Marijuana
Business or Cultivation Site. Square Footage payments shall be made annually at the beginning of
the calendar year and should be based on the square footage that the marijuana business is authorized
to cultivate by either a City permit or license, or by a state license in the absence of a City permit or
license, not deducting for unutilized square footage, pro-rated based on the number of months of
operation.

H.	Delinquent date-Penalties.

Any individual or entity who fails to pay the taxes required by this Section within thirty (30)
days after the due date shall pay in addition to the taxes a penalty for nonpayment in a sum equal to
twenty-five percent (25%) of the total amount due. Additional penalties will be assessed in the
following manner: ten percent (10%) shall be added on the first day of each calendar month
following the month of the imposition of the twenty-five percent (25%) penalty if the tax remains
unpaid; up to a maximum of one hundred percent (100%) of the tax payable on the due date. Receipt
of the tax payment in the office shall govern the determination of whether the tax is delinquent.
Postmarks will not be accepted as adequate proof of a timely payment.

I.	Records Inspection.

Whenever it is necessary to examine any books or records, including tax returns, of any
Marijuana Business or Cultivation Site in the City to ascertain the amount of any tax due pursuant
to this Section, the City shall have the power and authority to examine such necessary books and

J.	Suspension, Revocation and Appeal.

The provisions of Sections 3.80.429.1 (Suspension or Revocation) and 3.80.429.5 (Appeal
of License Revocation) shall apply in the case of Marijuana Businesses or Cultivation Sites
governed by this Section.

K.	Application of Provisions.

No business license permit issued under the provisions of this Code, or the payment of any tax
required under the provisions of this Code shall be construed as authorizing the conduct or
continuance of any illegal business or of a legal business in an illegal manner. Nothing in this Section
implies or authorizes that any activity connected with the distribution or possession of cannabis is
legal unless otherwise authorized and allowed by California and federal law. Nothing in this Section
shall be applied or construed as authorizing the sale of marijuana.

L.	Operative Date.

This ordinance establishing a marijuana business tax shall only become operative 1) if Chapter
5.89 of the Long Beach Municipal Code (banning marijuana businesses in the City of Long Beach)
is repealed and 2) if a regulatory scheme to permit marijuana businesses within the City is adopted.
The tax shall become effective on the effective date of the regulatory ordinance as provided by law

SECTION 3. Approval by the Voters/Competing Measure.

A.	Pursuant to California Elections Code Section 9217, this Ordinance must be
approved by at least a majority of the eligible voters of the City of Long Beach voting at the Special
Election of November 8, 2016.

B.	Further, pursuant to California Elections Code 9221, this Ordinance is expressly

declared by the voters to conflict with Section 2 of Long Beach Measure “_” (the “Kelton Measure”

establishing a different rate and methodology of marijuana business license taxation). Therefore, if
both this Ordinance and Section 2 of the Kelton Measure are approved by a majority of eligible
Long Beach voters, the provision receiving the highest number of affirmative votes shall become
effective and the other shall be of no force and effect.

C.	Either this Ordinance or Section 2 of the Kelton Measure, whichever receives the
highest number of affirmative votes pursuant to California Elections Code Section 9221, shall be
deemed adopted and take effect ten (10) days after the City Council has certified the results of that
election by resolution.

SECTION 4. Severability. If any provision of this Ordinance or the application thereof to
any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the Ordinance and the application of
such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.

SECTION 5. Certification/Summarv. Following the City Clerk’s certification that the
citizens of Long Beach have approved this Ordinance, the Mayor shall sign this Ordinance and the
City Clerk shall cause the same to be entered in the book of original ordinances of said City; and
shall cause the same, or a summary thereof, to be published as required by law. (/end)
