Ballot question

The question on the ballot appeared as:[i]

Shall the City of Marina’s Municipal Code be amended to eliminate the
temporary increase in the existing transient occupancy tax rate from ten
percent (10%) to twelve percent (12%) and to make permanent the
increase from ten percent (10%) to twelve percent (12%) to continue
preserving funds for general City services such as police, fire, street	^

repair, park maintenance, and recreation and community programs? [2]

Support

In general, supporters of higher hotel taxes argued that this type of tax is good because
it requires visitors to the city to contribute some revenue to cover the city services they
used while staying, such as public safety, parks and road and infrastructure
maintenance. They also argued that the tax is a great way to create additional revenue
for the city without increasing taxes for residents, since the tax is mainly paid by tourists
and visitors.

Opposition

In general, opponents of increased hotel taxes were concerned the tax could hurt the
tourism industry by making hotels outside the city cheaper and giving them a
competitive advantage over hotels inside the city limits.
