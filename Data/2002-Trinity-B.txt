<impartial> COUNTY COUNSEL’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
OF MEASURE B

This measure, if passed by majority of voters, would increase the Transient Occupancy
Tax rate from 5% to 10%. This tax is imposed on persons who occupy hotels, motels, resorts,
trailer parks and campgrounds within Trinity County for a period of 30 days or less.

A “YES” vote would be a vote to increase the current Transient Occupancy Tax for
Trinity County from 5% to 10%.

A “NO” vote would be a vote to keep the tax rate at 5%. <impartialend>
