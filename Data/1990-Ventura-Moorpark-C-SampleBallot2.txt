SPECIAL TAX ELECTION  CITY ATTORNEY IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS*  MEASURE “C"  On August 1, 1990, the City Council of the City of Moorpark adopted Resolution No, 90-703 which establishes Community Facilities District No. 1	Unlike Los Angeles County, residents of Ventura County are not protected by a county-wide paramedic service. Emergency medical services in Moorpark! are currently provided by a private ambulance service which does not station] any paramedic equipped units within our City limits. Often paramedic units] are not first to respond to an emergency in our city. This ballot measure will] provide a paramedic unit stationed within Moorpark, providing a substantial reduction in response time that could literally mean the difference between I'rfrt

limit except as adjusted annually for subsequent changes in the cost of living and population.  This measure, if approved, will levy the special tax to fund ambulance and paramedic services and public facilities related to those services, with the rate and method of apportionment as provided in Resolution No. 90-703. The special tax must be levied annually by City Council resolution. It may not exceed the maximum rate established by Resolution No. 90-703, but it may be set at a rate lower than provided for in Resolution No. 90-703. The tax on each non-exempt parcel within Community Facilities District No. 1 will be collected in the same manner as ordinary ad valorem taxes are collected and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure, sale and lien priority in case of delinquency as is provided for ad valorem taxes. The special tax, however, is not an ad valorem tax based on the assessed value of the parcel.	s/ Bernardo Perez Mayor s/ Eloise Brown Councilmember 1 s/ Clint Harper, Ph.D.  Councilmember •'
This measure, if approved, will also establish the initial appropriations limit for Community Facilities District No. 1 at $869,520.00. The City Council may adjust the appropriations limit annually for subsequent changes in the cost of living and population as authorized by California Constitution Article XIIIB.	REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE “C"
A “yes" vote on this measure favors levying a special tax for ambulance and paramedic services and establishing an appropriations limit.  A "no’’ vote on this measure opposes levying a special tax for ambulance and paramedic services and establishing an appropriations limit.  ‘Section 5011 of the California Elections Code allows the City Attorney to prepare an impartial analysis of each City measure appearing on the ballot.  The above statement is an impartial anlaysis of Measure “C”. If you desire a copy of the ordinance, please cairthe City Clerk’s Office at 805/529-6864 and a copy will be mailed at no cost to you.	We all want to save lives. But, will this measure do that? We don’t think so. We believe the city shouldn’t be in a business in which it has no experience. The budget for this service doesn’t even allocate money for gasoline for the ambulance.  Our volume of calls is so low, the paramedics we hire may not be able to remain certified without retraining, a cost not included in the tax.  We are very concerned about the liability to taxpayers of running this business.  Saving lives depends on reducing response times. The fact is that this measure may not do that, it may even increase response times.  The county’s provider has an exclusive contract to run this business. If they litigate this measure, Moorpark could be left with only this ambulance. That’s a risk we don't think is warranted.  We are also concerned about what this unnecessary tax will do to your property value. Higher taxes make it more difficult to sell a home for what it should be worth.  The goal of this measure is worthy. It’s just the wrong way to accomplish it. We think our taxes are high enough already to pay for enhanced service without it costing us nearly $900,000 more, risking more litigation and unknown liability.  Vote to save lives. Vote NO on higher taxes and say yes to better service with existing taxes.

ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE “C”

i neurtax is an unnecessary waste of money.

i will NOT put paramedics in fire stations.

i will NOT result in better service.

1'is no guarantee that this tax will reduce response time. In fact, it may
se response times. No contract exists for mutual assistance from the
; provider.

i maximum tax the Council could assess automatically increases without
r approval by the cost of living. With the current cost of living, this tax
jldidouble by the year 2000.

location has been identified for housing the ambulance. Depending on
j it is put, some areas of the city could receive less service,
volume of calls is so low, the personnel may not be able to remain
rtlfled without retraining, a cost not included in the tax.

i tix also doesn’t include the price of dispatching equipment to integrate
with 911. The measure was so hastily drawn, other necessary costs are also
not included, such as the expense of litigation that is likely if this measure
passes.

This measure appears to have been drafted to enhance the re-election
campaigns of existing councilmembers. We should stop playing politics with
peoples' lives. We can negotiate enhanced service from our current provider
I a small fraction of this tax. That amount could come from the city's General
Fund Reserve. Why should we pay more for something we should be getting
already? Why should we pay more and get less than we have now?

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE "C"

With two of us (Brown and Harper) running for re-election it is probably not
very smart politics to be asking the voters to increase taxes. Also, the authors
of this ballot measure are homeowners and we are not pleased with the
prospect of raising our own taxes! Our overriding concern is with life and
safety, particularly of children.

Despite attempts by the opponents of Measure C to cloud the issue, the facts
are quite simple: Moorpark currently does not have any paramedic units
stationed within our city limits. All concerned parents realize that stationing
a paramedic unit locally will significantly improve our emergency response
capability.

In public testimony, the current ambulance contractor indicates that backup
service can be provided between the existing ambulance units and a new city
paramedic unit. This further improves emergency coverage in our
community.

Under the “worst case" budget presented in the measure, a residential unit
would pay approximately $1.55 per week to support a local paramedic unit.
Our research indicates that cooperation with the County could reduce this
very modest cost even further.

Measure C's opponents state that the funding could come from the City's
general fund reserve, which is true. But in our opinion draining our City's
financial reserves is irresponsible. It would be more prudent to maintain our
reserve funds as insurance against probable reduction in State revenue
sharing with.cities.

Vote YES on Measure C. Your vote could save lives.

Vote NO on this measure and demand the service for which we already pay.

CITY ATTORNEY IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
MEASURE C

On August lr 1990, the City Council of the City of
Moorpark adopted Resolution No. 90-703 which establishes
Community Facilities District No. l (Moorpark Paramedic and
Ambulance District) and calls for an election to levy a
special tax within Community Facilities District No. l to
fund facilities and services (including, but not limited to,
paramedic station and staff, ambulance vehicles and
paramedic equipment, ambulance and paramedic services, and
related costs) and to establish an appropriations limit as
defined in California Constitution Article XIIIB.

Proposition 62, adopted by the voters of California
on November 4, 1986, provides that the Community Facilities
District may not impose any special tax unless the tax is
approved by two-thirds of the voters voting in an election
on the issue of levying the special tax.

Proposition 4, adopted by the voters of California
on November 6, 1979, provides that voters within the
Community Facilities District may establish an annual
appropriations limit, and that annual expenditures may not
exceed that limit except as adjusted annually for subsequent
changes in the cost of living and population.

This measure, if approved, will levy the special
tax to fund ambulance and paramedic services and public
facilities related to those services, with the rate and
method of apportionment as provided in Resolution No.

90-703. The special tax must be levied annually by City
Council resolution. It may not exceed the maximum rate
established by Resolution No. 90-703, but it may be set at a
rate lower than provided for in Resolution No. 90-703. The
tax on each non-exempt parcel within Community Facilities
District No. 1 will be collected in the same manner as
ordinary ad valorem taxes are collected and shall be subject
to the same penalties and the same procedure, sale and lien
priority in case of delinquency as is provided for ad
valorem taxes. The special tax, however, is not an ad
valorem tax based on the assessed value of the parcel.

This measure, if approved, will also establish the
initial appropriations limit for Community Facilities

District No. 1 at $869,520.00. The City Council may adjust
the appropriations limit annually for subsequent changes in
the cost of living and population as authorized by
California Constitution Article XIIIB.

A "yes” vote on this measure favors levying a
special tax for ambulance and paramedic services and
establishing an appropriations limit.

A Mno" vote on this measure opposes levying a
special tax for ambulance and paramedic services and
establishing an appropriations limit.
