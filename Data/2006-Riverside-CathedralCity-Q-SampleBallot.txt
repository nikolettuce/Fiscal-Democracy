IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE “Q"

If adopted by a majority of voters, this ballot Measure “CT places an
ordinance before the voters to impose or to not impose a local
transactions and use tax (“Transactions and Use Tax") of three-quarters

of a cent (.75%) within the jurisdiction of the City of Cathedral City
(■'City").

Currently, the State of California imposes a statewide Sales and Use Tax
at the rate of 7.25% and the County of Riverside imposes a countywide
transactions and use tax at the rate of 0.50% upon all retailers for the
privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail establishments and
for the storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property
purchased from a retailer.

Currently, the City has the authority, subject to voter approval, to impose
a tax in increments of 0.25% up to a maximum amount of 1.50%. The
City is proposing a local Transactions and Use Tax in the amount of
three-quarters of a cent (.75%). This proposed Transactions and Use
Tax would be imposed in addition to the State of California's 7.25% Sales
and Use Tax and the County of Riverside's 0.50% transactions and use
tax currently imposed within the City’s boundaries. Therefore, if the
proposed Measure "Q" is enacted by the electorate, then the total tax
imposed within the City would be increased from 7.75% to 8.50%.

If the City's Transactions and Use Tax is enacted, the proceeds from the
City's Transactions and Use Tax collected within the jurisdiction of the
City will be paid to the State Board of Equalization, which will then
forward the tax proceeds to the City. The City will deposit the tax
proceeds info the City’s General fund. The City Council of the City
spends General fund monies according to its adopted budget in support
of the City's ordinary and necessary operations including, but not limited
to, public safety services such as police, fire and paramedic services,
planning and public works services, and youth and senior programs.
Detailed information concerning the City’s budget is a matter of public
record and is available at the Cathedral City City Hall and at the
Cathedral City Public Library.

A “yes" vote on this Measure means that you want a local Transactions
and Use Tax of .75% to be imposed within the jurisdiction of the City of
Cathedral City,

A “no” vote on this Measure means that you do not want a local
Transactions and Use Tax of .75% to be imposed within the jurisdiction of
the City of Cathedral City.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure “Q”, If you
desire a copy of the full text of the City’s proposed Transactions
and Use Tax, please contact the City Clerk’s Office at (760) 770-0322
and a copy will be mailed to you at no cost.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE *‘Q”

Measure “O” is about what kind of city Cathedral City residents want to
live m.

Are we satisfied with police stretched sc thinly that there’s a 70% chance
when an emergency call is made that all available personnel are already

responding to other calls'? Or that fire and paramedic response times are
increasing.

Are we satisfied with pot holes that jar the suspensions of our vehicles,

limited street sweeping and pools of dirty water in the streets?

Do we want activities for local youth to keep them occupied, off the
streets and in better physical shape?

Do we want parks and recreation services for the community?

Our homes in Cathedral City are our biggest investment. Adequate city
services and facilities protect our investment. A thriving community also

attracts ana retains business.

As a post Proposition 13 city, on average, only about $12.20 PER YEAR
of your property taxes go to the City's General Fund.

Redevelopment dollars can’t be used for operations like police, fire, road
repair, and street sweeping. That is why sales tax is so important for

providing city services.

People live in Cathedral City because they enjoy its convenience, its
spirit of independent thinking, its history of welcoming people from all
walks of life. Voting yes on Measure “Q” builds on that spirit for a City we
can be proud of.

Less than a penny spent on every dollar in Cathedral City can increase
the level of service to everyone in the community

58% of the community, based on a recent survey, said they knew that
Cathedral City did not have enough money to meet increasing demands
for city services. 58% said they favored a tax increase to support higher
levels of service.
