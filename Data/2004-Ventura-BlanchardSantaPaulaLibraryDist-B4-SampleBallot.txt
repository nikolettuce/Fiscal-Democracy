BLANCHARD/SANTA PAULA PUBLIC LIBRARY DISTRICT IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL* MEASURE "B4"	ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE "B4”  Over the last thirty years, Your Community Library suffered a series of cutbacks, intensified by California’s budgetary crisis. In a Catch-22, the State cut funding while requiring that the library budget not be reduced from the previous year (if we want state aid). Your Library couldn’t meet that
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 4 of article XIIIA of the California Constitution, this measure, if approved by two-thirds of the votes cast by the voters of the District voting on the measure at the March 2,2004, election, will allow the Blanchard/Santa Paula Public Library to enhance or increase the previously authorized levy of a special assessment tax of $25.00 by the amount of $15.00 for a total amount of $40.00 per year per parcel of land, developed and undeveloped, for an unspecified number of years, for the purposes of providing adequate and ongoing library services to residents of the District.	requirement. Fortunately, the City of Santa Paula provided us with matching! funds this year.  Historically, the loss in funds was offset when Santa Paula voters passed a measure augmenting the budget by about $188,000 annually. With this added funding the library increased its weekly hours from 19 to 44.  Now, recent funding cutbacks made it necessary to reduce hours again.  Your vote for Measure B4 will enable Your Community Library, Santa Paula’s cultural center, to increase its hours again, to continue to attract and retain competent staff and to provide you and your children and friends with a wide array of services, including:
