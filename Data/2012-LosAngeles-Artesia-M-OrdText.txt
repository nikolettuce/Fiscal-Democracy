ARTESIA LOCAL SERVICES ORDINANCE

AN ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF ARTESIA UPDATING THE

EXISITING BUSINESS LICENSE TAXES AND AMENDING THE

ARTESIA MUNICIPAL CODE

WHEREAS, the State has already taken more than $1.5 million dollars from Artesia to
deal with its own budget deficit; and

WHEREAS, effective February 1, 2012, the state has eliminated all redevelopment
agencies in the state, including the Artesia Redevelopment Agency causing a halt to construction
projects-and economic development activities in Artesia; and

WHEREAS, this State takeaway mean that approximately $1 million in annual future
revenues that the City has relied upon to fund various projects has been eliminated, putting into
significant jeopardy projects that have been partially completed and which may require City
funds to complete; and

WHEREAS, as a result of State takeaways the City has already reduced its workforce by
30%, affecting our community services; and

WHEREAS, no additional budget cuts can be made without affecting current levels of
public safety and police services, including neighborhood patrols, and crime and gang prevention
programs; and

WHEREAS, police staffing levels are already the absolute minimum recommended for a
city the size of Artesia; and

WHEREAS, without increased local revenue, other community services such as street
maintenance may need to be even further reduced, causing Artesia’s streets, roads, sidewalks and
public infrastructure to deteriorate further and fall into disrepair; and

WHEREAS, Artesia needs to have a protected, reliable source of local revenue to
prevent severe cuts to vital community services as we cannot rely on Sacramento; and

WHEREAS, to offset severe budget cuts, Artesia should update its existing, but
outdated, business license ordinance as it has been over 20 years since rates have been updated;
and

WHEREAS, because the ordinance is outdated, it is unfair that current businesses are
classified and pay the rates, while others are not; and

WHEREAS, updating the City’s outdated business license ordinance will help to
stabilize Artesia’s financial situation, protect vital community services, and maintain fairness and
equity for our community’s small businesses, while ensuring that larger corporate industries pay
their fair share; and

WHEREAS, the measure will continue our City’s fiscally prudent management approach
by requiring independent citizens’ oversight, mandatory financial audits, and yearly reports to
the community to ensure that all funds are spent as promised; and

WHEREAS, this measure will give Artesia local control over local funds for local needs
where no funds can be taken by the State; and

WHEREAS, Article 6 (Business License Tax Amounts) of Chapter 1 (Business
Licenses and Business License Taxes) of Title 3 (Finance) of the Artesia Municipal Code
establishes the rate of various business license taxes for every person conducting any business,
profession, trade, commercial enterprise or occupation in the City, with such taxes due and
payable to the Tax Collector on the first day of January of every year; and

A0444-1026\I454729v9.doc

WHEREAS, Article 6 (Business License Tax Amounts), in its current form, specifically

WHEREAS, the City’s prior establishment and revision to business license tax rates is
summarized as follows:

A.	On August 17, 1959, the City adopted the original ordinance (“Ordinance
No. 24”) establishing business licenses taxes. Ordinance No. 24 defined relevant terms
pd provided general provisions related to the collection of the business license taxes. It
also established rates with respect to: (1) Retail and Wholesale businesses, (2)
Professions and Semi-Professions and similar businesses, and (3) Manufacturers. It also
established flat rates for miscellaneous businesses, including contractors, hospitals, and
businesses delivering goods, wares or merchandise from vehicles.

B.	On February 8, 1960 and October 5, 1964, by the adoption of Ordinance
No. 35 and 90, the City established a flat fee for “hay dealers” and “rubbish collectors,”
respectively. Ordinance No. 35 also established the maximum annual license tax to be
paid by any person as $250.00.

C.	On July 13, 1970, by adoption of Ordinance No. 151, the City established
a flat rate for “Dance halls, Public” and “Entertainment,” and defined relevant terms
thereof.

D.	On May 14, 1973, by adoption of Ordinance No. 208, the City added a
new section pertaining to Vending Machines only, basing the tax on two percent (2%) of
the gross receipts, rather than a flat rate.

E.	On June 14, 1982, by adoption of Ordinance No. 343, the City to

established a tax of $250.00 for each separately licensed “video game” machine and then
subsequently revised that rate down to $50.00 per video machine on November 14, 1983,
by adoption of Ordinance No. 356.	1

F.	On August 11, 1986, by adoption of Ordinance No. 402, the City
increased rates for retail and wholesale businesses, professions and semi-professions, and
provided an illustrative list of such businesses. It also increased rates for manufacturers,
based on number of employees and established flat rates for miscellaneous businesses,
billiards and pool rooms, dance halls and entertainment, and deliveries by vehicles.

G.	On October 15, 1990, by adoption of Ordinance No. 461, the City made
numerous administrative changes to the “Business License Tax Ordinance.” With respect
to business license taxes for retail and wholesale businesses, the City established the
rates, based on gross annual receipts, which are contained in the Municipal Code today,
and deleted “contractors” from the illustrative list of businesses to which such fees would
be applicable. With respect to professions and semi-professions, the City established
rates, based on gross annual receipts, with rates for additional members and employees.
With respect to manufacturers, the City established the rates, based on gross annual
receipts, which are contained in the Municipal Code today. With respect to vending
machines, it increased the percentage of gross annual receipts upon which the tax is based
from two percent (2%) to four percent (4%) and established the amount of tax for video
games as $100.00 per machine, as is also currently contained in the Municipal Code.
Finally, it revised the flat rates for miscellaneous businesses and provided the flat rates
for billiards and poolrooms, circuses and carnivals, dance halls and entertainment, and
deliveries by vehicles, which are, in substantial part, currently contained in the Code.

H.	Oil December 9, 1991, by adoption of Ordinance No. 473, the City
decreased the rates related to professions and semi-professions to the rates currently
provided in the Code and added provisions related to “medical centers,” “hospitals,” and
“dental groups.”

I.	On August 9, 1993, by adoption of Ordinance No. 497-U, the City
provided that all tax amounts would be due in advance on January 1st of each year, rather
than October 1st of each year.

reduced certain tax rates and added provisions related to penalties, business license seals,
and temporary licenses. It also provided that businesses license taxes and permit fees
would be increased annually based on the consumer price index; and

WHEREAS, the City’s staff has determined that rates for business license taxes within
the. Business License Tax Ordinance, contained at Chapter 1 (Business Licenses and Business
License Taxes) of Title 3 (Finance) of the Artesia Municipal Code, have not been amended since
October 15, 1990. Specifically, with the exception of rates for professions and semi-professions,
which were decreased to current rates on December 9, 1991, by Ordinance No. 473, the rates
