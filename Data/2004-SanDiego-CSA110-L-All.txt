ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION L

Since 1976, the community has worked hard to build a fire department capable of meeting its
emergency needs. In 1985, the community requested formation of County Service Area 110 as a
way of helping to fund the Palomar Mountain Volunteer Fire Department (PMVFD) and since then,
has raised thousands of dollars to support the emergency services which the PMVFD provides.

This year, the community approached the Department with the idea of establishing a benefit fee to
help fund the PMVFD's operating budget. Currently, It costs about $36,000 to run the PMVFD, of
which about $23,000 comes from a portion of the local property taxes already being collected by
the County. Most of the rest comes from donations and annual fund-raising drives. Unfortunately,
owing mostly to large increases in insurance premiums, dispatching fees and communications
costs, the Department's operating expenses will rise above the amount of money it receives
annually from all sources, including property taxes, donations and fund raising efforts.

Recognizing that the community has supported its fire department for the past thirty years, the
PMVFD has worked hard to increase the level of service it provides. Since 1998 the Department
has garnered over $800,000 in grants, by which it has upgraded all of its apparatus and obtained a
great deal of new emergency equipment.

Unfortunately, the PMVFD has not been able to find grants that will assist it with operating
expenses, which is why members of the community approached the Department with the idea of a
local benefit fee. The Department understands that the decision of how much, or even if, to support
the PMVFD lies with the community. By placing Proposition L on the ballot, the Department hopes
to give the community the opportunity to continue its support of the PMVFD’s efforts to provide
excellent emergency services.

Section 6. If the proposition is approved, the Board of Supervisors shall establish schedules
varying each of such Special Benefit Taxes according to value of benefits to each parcel and
