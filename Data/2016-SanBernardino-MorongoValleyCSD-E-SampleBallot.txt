MEASURE E

MORONGO VALLEY COMMUNITY SERVICES DISTRICT

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE E

This Impartial Analysis of Measure E has been prepared by the County
Counsel pursuant to Section 9313 of the California Elections Code.

Measure E is submitted to the voters by the Morongo Valley Community Services
District ("District") to authorize the District to convert a current benefit assessment of
3% per year which has been in effect since 2002, into a special parcel tax of $350
each year, adjusted for inflation, to be assessed on all taxable real property within the
District to use in funding fire protection and paramedic services provided by the
District. A yes vote by two-thirds of the voters within the District on this measure will
authorize the Board of Directors of the District to convert the 3% assessment into a
special parcel tax of $350 per year beginning in the 2016-2017 fiscal year. This
assessment will be used to provide fire suppression, protection, prevention, rescue,
advance life support paramedics, and other emergency services within the District, and
for any related incidental expenses.

The assessment will be levied against all taxable real property within the District on
July 1st of each year, beginning on July 1, 2016. The special tax will be adjusted
annually for inflation based on the Consumer Price Index for the Los
Angeles/Riverside/Orange County region, and shall be collected by the County of San
Bernardino in the same manner as county property taxes.

If fewer than two-thirds of the voters approve this measure, the Board of Directors of
the District will not be authorized to convert the current 3% Morongo Valley Fire and
Rescue Assessment into a special parcel tax of $350 each year, and real property in
the district will continue to be assessed in the amount of 3% per year.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure E. If you desire a copy
of the measure, please call the Morongo Valley Community Services District at
(760) 363-6454 and a copy will be mailed to you at no cost.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE E

This Argument in Favor of Measure E was submitted pursuant to Section
9315 of the California Elections Code. It is the opinion of the author(s) and
has been printed exactly as submitted.

KEEP IT LOCAL

Continue to protect the lives and property of Morongo Valley residents with locally
housed and controlled fire and advanced life support paramedic service by voting YES
on Measure E.

Local service provides the quickest response when homes, land, or businesses catch
fire. The proximity of fire and paramedic service is even more critical when residents
need advanced life saving skills. Minutes count when determining whether a person
lives or dies.

YES on Measure E says that we accept the recommendations of recognized safety
organizations for staffing levels because we care about the lives and working conditions
of our fire and paramedic professionals. We believe in following these "best practices".
The additional revenue ensures this.

YES on Measure E means that the existing Fire Service Assessment will be eliminated,
adding an increase of about $200 for an improved parcel. Unimproved parcels currently
pay a very small amount and would cost less than $1 per day.

NO on Measure E means that San Bernardino County Fire may annex Morongo Valley
at a cost of $635 or $853 per improved and unimproved parcels per year depending on
the service level. The county could then periodically review the cost of services and
increases would be decided by the county central government.

YES on Measure E means that funding decisions for our fire and paramedic service will
stay local while providing this service at a cost much lower than San Bernardino County
Fire.

YES on Measure E says that we want to uphold our history of taking care of our own
community.

YES on Measure E says that Morongo Valley residents want quality property protection
and lifesaving services for ourselves and our families, our neighbors, and fellow highway
travelers.
