FULL TEXT OF MEASURED

CITY OF CRESCENT CITY INCREASE OF TRANSIENT
OCCUPANCYTAX

Section 1. Authority. This resolution is adopted pursuant to
Government Code Section 53720, et seq.

Section 2. Title. This resolution may be cited as the Transient
Occupancy Tax Resolution of 2006.

Section 3. Proposal. California Government Code Section 7280
provides that cities may levy a tax on the privilege of occupying a
room or other lodging for not more than 30 days. This privilege is
called a transient occupancy tax. Section 3.20.020 of the Crescent
City Municipal Code and Crescent City Resolution 1993-17 currently
establish City of Crescent City's transient occupancy tax at ten percent
(10%), which tax was last increased on July 1, 1993.

It is proposed that a general tax measure to increase the transient
occupancy tax to twelve percent (12%) be submitted to the voters
of the City of Crescent City at the general election on Tuesday,
November 7,2006, which coincides with the next regularly scheduled
municipal election.

Such action is taken pursuant to California Constitution Article
XIIC, ‘2(b) which requires that any general tax be passed by a two-
thirds vote of the legislative body, and by a majority of the voters
voting in an election on the tax which is consolidated with a regularly
scheduled general election of members of the governing body.

Because this action would not limit the increase of the transient
occupancy tax to any specific purpose, it is proposed as a general
tax measure.

Section 4. Rate to be Charged as a General Tax. The city council
does hereby find that a general tax, which is an increase of the
transient occupancy tax by two percent (2%), and which the
operators of hotels will collect as provided in Chapter 3.20 of the
Crescent City Municipal Code, is in the best interest of the City of
Crescent City.

Section 5. The city council finds and declares that this is a general
tax, for general government purposes, and not a special or ad valorem
tax.

Section 6. Method of Collection. This general tax, if confirmed
by the voters, shall be collected as provided in Chapter 3.20 of the
Crescent City Municipal Code.

Section 7. Election Date. The proposed general tax shall be
submitted to the voters of the City of Crescent City at the next
regularly scheduled municipal election to be included and consolidated
with the state-wide general election held on November 7, 2006,
pursuant to Crescent City Resolutions 2006-16 and 2006-17
Pursuant to the requirements of Section 10403 of the California
Elections Code, the Board of Supervisors of the County of Del Norte
is hereby requested to consent and agree to the consolidation of
this election with the state-wide election on November 7, 2006, for
the purpose of the election of the measure, with notice of time and
place of holding the election to be given by the county clerk, and
the county clerk is authorized to give further or additional notice of
the election, in time, form and manner as required by law.

Section 8. The ballots to be used at the election shall be in the
form and content as required by law. The measure shall appear as
designed by the county clerk.

Section 9. The city clerk is hereby authorized, instructed and directed
to assist the county clerk with any reasonable requests in order to
properly and lawfully conduct the election.

Section 10. The polls for the election shall be open at the times
and places designated by the county clerk as required by law.

Section 11. In all particulars not recited in this resolution, the
election shall be held and conducted as provided by law for holding
municipal elections.

Section 12. Effective Date of Tax. The qualified voters at the
general election shall submit this resolution, being for the enactment
and imposition of a general tax, to a vote of the people on November
7, 2006. The tax shall become valid and binding if a majority of
the voters voting thereon vote in its favor at said election and shall
be effective on the date that the city council certifies the results of
said election and passes a resolution adopting same as set forth
in Chapter 3.20 of the Crescent City Municipal Code.

Section 13. Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence,
clause or phrase of this resolution is, for any reason, held to be
invalid, unconstitutional or otherwise unlawful by the decision of a
court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the remaining portions of this resolution, the application
thereof, and the general taxes imposed shall not be affected thereby
but shall remain in full force and effect, it being the intention of the
voters to adopt each and every section, subsection, part, clause,
sentence or phrase regardless of whether any other section,
subsection, part, clause, sentence or phrase or the application thereof
if held to be invalid or unconstitutional. The City Council of the City
of Crescent City hereby declares that it would have passed this
resolution and each section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase
thereof irrespective of the fact that one or more of the sections,
subsections, sentences, clauses or phrases be declared invalid,
unconstitutional or unlawful.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the City Council of
the City of Crescent City, pursuant to its right and authority, that

Del Norte. That the city clerk shall certify to the passage and
adoption of this resolution.

08504

The City of Crescent City submits to the voters for approval of
an Increase Of The Transient Occupancy Tax.

The City of Crescent City is proposing a General Tax Measure to
be submitted to the voters in the City of Crescent City. The proposed
tax is a general tax, for general governmental purposes, and not a
special or ad valorem tax.

The tax requires a majority vote of those voting on the measure.
Revenue raised by the tax would go to the general fund of the City
of Crescent City to be used for general governmental purposes.
Examples of general governmental purpose expenditures are local
services such as fire, police, recreation, parks, senior programs,
street maintenance and tourism marketing, which are services that
benefit travelers.

The transient occupancy tax of the “City of Crescent City is contained
in Chapter 3.20 of the Crescent City Municipal Code and Resolution
1993-17. This tax would apply to hotels and other lodging facilities
as defined in the Crescent City Municipal Code, from persons
occupying hotels for 30 consecutive days or less. California city's
transient occupancy tax rates have an approximate range of 8% to
19%. The current tax of the City of Crescent City is ten percent
(10%) of the rent charged by the lodging operator. This measure
would increase the tax by two percent (2%).

If the proposed general tax receives the approval of a majority of
the voters voting on the measure it will pass. The tax would become
effective on the date the City Council certifies the results of the
election and passes a Resolution indicating the amount of the new
tax ads passed. The proposed general tax is not limited to any time
period. If approved by a majority of the voters voting on the measure,
the tax would remain in effect until later amended.

A “Yes” vote favors passage of this general tax on transient occupancy
only, while a "No” vote is against passage of this general tax on
transient occupancy.

si Thomas C. French
City Attorney, City of Crescent City

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure D.
If you desire a copy of the Resolution proposing the Increase
of the Transient Occupancy Tax, please call the Del Norte
County Clerks Office at 707 464-7216, and a copy will be
mailed to you at no cost.

FISCAL IMPACT STATEMENT FOR MEASURE D

Measure D will increase the Transient and Occupancy Tax (TOT)
rate from 10% to 12%. A twenty percent increase from this revenue
source is anticipated if Measure D is approved by the voters of
Crescent City. During the July 1, 2005-June 30, 2006 fiscal year the
City of Crescent City received revenues of $821,340 from the TOT.
Passage of Measure D would result in a projected annual revenue
increase of $164,268 to the City of Crescent City.

s/ Edwin Erickson
Finance Director of the City of Crescent City

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE D

Measure D is an increase in the Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) of
Crescent City from 10 percent to 12 percent. The TOT is paid by
visitors to Crescent City who stay in hotels, motels, and RV/trailer
parks. The residents of Crescent City do not pay TOT unless they
stay in one of the above.

The TOT goes directly to the General Fund of Crescent City. The
City Council placed the 2 percent TOT increase on the ballot primarily
to fund tourism promotion and other services that directly benefit
the tourism industry. This action is in response to businesses and
residents that approached the City requesting funding of tourism
marketing efforts to further promote Crescent City and Del Norte
County as a destination travel location.

Please remember that the TOT is paid by visitors and travelers to
Crescent City, and not by the residents of Crescent City. Using the
bulk of the 2 percent TOT increase for tourism and services that
benefit tourism will grow the tourism industry locally, create jobs for
residents, sales dollars for local businesses, and sales tax revenue
to assist the City in providing additional services. Measure D is a
win-win for the entire community!
