RANCHO ADOBE FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT
MEASUREZ

Shall Ordinance No. 02-1 of the Rancho Adobe Fire

Z Protection District authorizing the District to impose and
levy a new special tax having a maximum rate of $30 per
unit of risk to assist in meeting the costs of providing
authorized services and exercising other rights and powers of the
District, increasing the District’s appropriations limit to permit
spending of the revenue raised by the special tax, and repealing the
existing special tax be approved?

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE Z

We need your helpl Please join your neighbors and friends in voting Yes on
Measure Z. The funds raised by Measure Z will enable the District to hire
additional Firefighters, provide greater levels of service and move closer to
compliance with National Fire Protection Association Standards on Deployment
and Staffing. A Yes vote on Measure Z enables the District to provide a greater
level of service to the community by staffing all three Rancho Adobe Fire stations
with two firefighters, 24 hour a day, seven days a week. A Yes vote on Measure Z
will also allow the District to hire additional firefighters to increase staffing on the
busiest engine companies which will reduce overtime costs.

The Rancho Adobe Fire District staff has extensively explored funding options.
This Measure is the only reliable method of achieving the appropriate level of fire
protection needed for this community. Emergency response calls have increased
44% since 1993, while the number of active volunteer firefighters has decreased
dramatically. On-duty firefighters are needed to maintain service levels and
response times.

The current staffing in the Rancho Adobe Fire District is inadequate. We cannot
continue to compromise the safety of the Community and it’s Firefighters.
Measure Z funds safety. Measure Z funds increased service. A Yes vote on
Measure Z funds peace of mind.

Please Vote Yes on Measure Z.

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE Z

Rancho Adobe Fire District claims to be understaffed and has fewer Volunteers.
This simply means that everyone wants to be paid. Fire departments, like
taxpayers don’t have enough money. We all must get by with less when money is
tight.

Property Taxes received by the Rancho Adobe Fire Protection District are as
follows: $1,447,431.00 Property Tax; $71,487.00 Boats, Claims & Business;
$25,638.00 Comes Back from State

Note that the Homeowners Exemption from the state comes back to the Fire
Department. Namely: $25,638.00

Please vote “No” on Measure Z.

ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE Z

Position Statement

Dear Friends: Once again, there is a big batch of new proposals for increased taxes
—and for killing Prop 13. They do it every time! Government gets bigger and more
expensive! If we lose Prop 13 we’ll be saddled with high taxes as we were in the
mid-sixties when government caused many to lose jobs, homes, and businesses
— the sort of shenanigins that produced Prop 13 to begin with!

So, here we go again? Not on your life, not if we can help it. We must have more
thorough studies of the actual situation — more time. We are being threatened by
our own government that if they don’t have more money they will be forced to cut
services. Nonsense! If people negotiate in good faith a workable middle way is
always there. We urge a “No” vote on all increased taxes!

Resolution No. R-3-2002 and
Resolution No. R-3-2002,2003

$20.00 per Unit in Fiscal 2004-2005 and thereafter. Appendix A Ordinance No.
02-1 to be printed in the Ballot Pamphlet. Any other tax measure will be opposed as
not needed. Property taxes are being collected so the County can allow more
money if it is necessary. Vote “No” on this proposal!

Fire Districts should be brought back to the local community. Merging was not only
a mistake but costs the taxpayer more!

REDWOOD EMPIRE TAX COMMITTEE
s/William W. Pisenti, President

REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE Z

Vote “Yes” for Measure Z. Provide adequate fire protection and emergency
medical services in our District.

We challenge the argument against. The author does not live within our District nor
has anyone from his group attended any meeting pertaining to this measure.
Contrary to the opposition’s comments, community members, the board, and staff
have been studying solutions to this issue for over eight months.

High taxes are an issue with everyone. The only means in accordance with
Proposition 13 for Special Districts, such as the Rancho Adobe Fire Protection
District, to secure appropriate operating funds, is to ask the District’s property
owners to realize the needed level of protection and self impose its cost.

Our opponents suggest that an increase to $20 per unit is adequate and more is
“not needed”. Yet they provide no support to justify this figure. We wish that $20
would be adequate. The funds from this initiative will not provide the ideal level of
staffing needed at all District Stations. It will, however, permit us to hire additional
firefighters to bring us to a safer staffing level.

Regarding local community: The funds raised here stay here.

We will continue to provide, to the best of our ability, the same level of service
tomorrow that we do today, but we are faced with increasing demands, and staffing
levels will be strained even more as our community grows.

Help our community be safer by providing the level of fire protection and
emergency medical services necessary. Please Pass Measure Z.
