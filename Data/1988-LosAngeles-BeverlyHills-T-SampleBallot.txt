Since 1964, the City has levied a general tax known as the Uniform Transient
Occupancy Tax. The Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax is imposed upon a
guest in a hotel who is required to pay a tax at the current rate of 11% of the
rent charged by the hotel operator for the room occupied by the guest. The
existing 11% rate was increased from 7% by the City Council on September
16, 1986.

On November 4, 1986, the voters in California approved a statewide ballot
measure, called Proposition 62, which requires any general tax imposed by a
city to be approved by a majority of the city’s voters voting on the tax. This
proposition contains a retroactive provision which states that any tax imposed
by a city on or after August 1,1985 and prior to November 4, 1986 may con-
tinue to be imposed only if approved by a majority vote. Any city which fails
to seek or obtain such voter approval must stop imposing the tax on November
15, 1988.

The legality of Proposition 62 is being challenged in the courts. Even if the
proposition is held to be valid, it is not clear whether the courts will find that
the voter approval requirement applies to increases in existing taxes. The City
Council is submitting this measure to the voters to ensure that the 11% tax
rate can continue to be imposed even if the legality of Proposition 62 is upheld
by the courts and the proposition is interpreted to apply to increases in existing
taxes.

A yes vote on the ballot question favors the continued imposition of the Uni-
form Transient Occupancy Tax at the rate of 11%.

A no vote on the ballot question favors a reduction in the existing rate of the
Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax from 11% to 7%.

If this ballot measure is not approved by a majority of the voters voting on
the measure, the rate of the Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax will be reduced
from 11% to 7% on November 15, 1988. The Director of Finance Administra-
tion estimates that this reduction in the tax rate would result in an annual loss
of over $2,500,000 in tax revenues to the City.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSfTION T" ===

City Councilmembers urge your “yes” vote on Proposition T. After intense
study of the community’s need for additional tax revenue, City Council
increased the hotel occupancy tax from 7% to 11% effective 10-16-86. Before
that date the hotel occupancy tax had not been increased since 6-29-78.

The increase to 11% brought the rate into alignment with the City of Los
Angeles.

Voter approval is necessary for the tax to continue beyond 11-15-88 at the
11% rate according to the provisions of state Proposition 62, approved by Cali-
fornia voters on 11-4-86.

A need for tax revenues became apparent when the City investigated the need
for expanded service levels including, but not limited to, a $2,000,000 increase
in funding of the Beverly Hills Unified School District and increased support
of the Visitors’ Bureau. The increase in this particular tax was approved so
as to minimize the impact upon City residents.

Failure to approve Proposition T would result in the tax rate reverting to 7%.
The annual loss of revenue would exceed $2,500,000 and would cause reduc-
tions in services provided to Beverly Hills residents.

While specific reductions have not been identified, $2,500,000 is the equiva-
lent of:

1.	Up to 50 sworn police officers, or

2.	A 58% reduction ip School District funding, or

3.	An 85% reduction in Library services, or

4.	A 30% reduction in the Fire Department, or

5.	All funding for the Visitors’ Bureau and all human service agencies, elimi-
nation of the tree trimming program and a 50% reduction in recreation
programs.

We believe the transient occupancy tax is fair and equitable. It requires tran-
sients (non-residents) to pay for the demands placed on City services caused
by the daily influx of these visitors. We urge you to support continuation of
the current tax rate with a “yes” vote.
