<impartial> IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE E

Measure E would authorize the Solano Transportation Improvement Authority to impose a
one-half cent sales tax for a maximum period of 20 years to fund the specific transportation
and traffic relief projects and programs identified in the Solano County Transportation
Expenditure Plan.

The measure requires the appointment of a citizens’ oversight committee.

The Authority adopted Ordinance # 02-01, which imposes the sales tax subject to approval
by the voters.

It is estimated that the sales tax will generate between $800 million to $1 billion dollars in
revenue for the transportation improvements. These revenues can be used for necessary
matching funds for State and Federal transportation grants as well as for funding locally
generated transportation improvements. The revenues would be used to supplement and not
replace existing local revenues used for transportation purposes.

The revenues could finance payment of Authority salaries and administration expenses,
which cannot exceed one percent (1%) of the annual revenues.

The Expenditure Plan and Ordinance #02-01 require that the tax revenues finance the
following transportation improvements:

1.	Countywide Priority Projects
Highway Program

I-80/I-680/SR 12 Interchange 20%
1-80 Corridor Improvements (Vallejo to Dixon) 20%

SR 12 Improvements (Napa to Rio Vista) 6%

SR 113 Safety Improvements (Dixon) 0.5%

Transit Program

Senior and Disabled Transit 6.5%
Express Bus Service 6.3%
Baylink Ferry Service 5%
Local Transit Improvements 5%
Commuter Rail Program
Commuter Rail to BART 9.7%
Commuter Rail to Sacramento 1.5%
Expanded Capital Corridor Service 0.5%
Alternative Modes Program

Transit Friendly Downtowns (TLC) 1.5%

Mitigation of Project Environmental Impacts 1%
Bicycle/Pedestrian Trails 1%
Park & Ride Lots/Rideshare 1.7%

2.	Local Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation

3.	Fast-Track Congestion Relief and Safety Program

Since the exact amount collected over the 20-year period is an estimate, the Expenditure
Plan allocates expenditures on a percentage basis among the various transportation projects.
Any proposed change in the percentage allocation would require an approval by a 3/4ths
vote of the Authority members. If the proposed change is greater than one percent (1%),
the Board of Supervisors and the City Councils of a majority of the cities with a majority of
the population of Solano County must approve it.

The measure authorizes the Authority to issue bonds to finance the transportation projects.
The bonds would be paid from the sales tax revenues.

A copy of the Ordinance and the Expenditure Plan are printed in the sample ballot.

The measure would become effective only upon the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds
of those voting on the measure.

A “YES” VOTE favors the imposition of the one-half cent sales tax to fund the 20 -year
Solano Transportation Expenditure Plan.

A “NO" VOTE opposes the imposition of the one-half cent sales tax to fund the 20 -year
Solano Transportation Expenditure Plan.

<favor> ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE E

In 1998, Solano County voters told the politicians to fix the 1-80/680 interchange and repave
our local streets and roads.

A concerned group of local citizens has spent two years developing the Solano Traffic Relief
Plan in Measure E that will finally force the county get these projects done now!

Measure E makes significant improvements to the l-80/680/Hwy 12 interchange resulting
in a whole new shape to the highway and a smoother commute through this notorious
bottleneck.

Measure E will expand congested sections of highway throughout Solano County, including
locations at Hwy 113, the entire stretch of Hwy 12 and traffic hot spots all along 1-80.

Measure E requires each Solano County city to immediately begin local street repairs and
safety improvements.

Solano voters also demanded more transit for working families and new services for seniors
and disabled to ensure well-planned traffic relief for Solano County.

Measure E means more Para-Transit shuttles for seniors and disabled. Measure E will
add commuter rail service to BART and new feeder buses for working families.

Measure E is a once-in-a-generation opportunity that we can’t afford to lose. Measure E is
critical to providing local dollars that are required to get our share of state and federal
matching funds to complete these projects now.

The 1-80/680 fix and the rest of the Solano Traffic Relief Plan were identified and included
in Measure E by a Citizens Advisory Committee made up of individual citizens from each
city in Solano County.

Measure E creates a Citizens’ Oversight Committee to ensure our tax dollars are spent only
on these projects, not bureaucracy!

That’s why our local chambers of commerce urge Yes on Measure E.

Vote by mail or on November 5'\ Vote for Solano Traffic Relief. Vote Yes on Measure E! <favorend>

<rebutfavor> REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE E

In political jargon, “PORK” is the name for this measure. Proponents promise money for
more mass transit - that’s buses and trains - even though hardly anyone rides what we
already have.

They want to add another ferry boat to the two now running out of Vallejo, ignoring the fact
that those boats don’t pay their way! Without a doubt, ferries are one of the least efficient
modes of transportation! Our taxes subsidize them now, to the tune of $1.5 to $2.5 million
dollars per year. Add another boat, add another million bucks! That’s not a smart use of
our taxes.

They promise “significant improvements” to the l-80/680/Hwy 12 interchanges and the “entire
stretch” of Highway 12. But the percentages allocated in this measure are a drop in the
bucket compared to what those jobs will actually cost!

Ask yourself these simple questions:

Should we alone pay for highway improvements that benefit drivers from all over the
country?

Should all of us pay for hiking and bike trails that will be used by a tiny fraction of
our population?

Should the whole county pay to fix potholes and put in traffic signals for a few cities?
Will this tax ever go away? Of course not!

Don’t let it start!

<against> ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE E

Citizens, Voters, Taxpayers

Don't be fooled by another government attempt to reach into your pocket.

This NEW TAX will not solve the problems faced by residents of Solano County.
According to the Solano Transportation Authority's analysis, more than ONE BILLION
DOLLARS of transportation improvements will remain unfunded even after we've paid the
tax for 23 years! The I-80/I-680/SR-12 interchanges, for example, will require an additional
340 million dollars to complete. That's because a large part of the tax revenues won't even
go towards fixing the highways! It's been promised to cities and environmental interests to
buy their support.

Solano County residents are already paying huge amounts of gasoline and automobile
taxes. But the State has hijacked that money! Most of it is being diverted to other purposes
- NOT to solving our problems! So we're being asked to tax ourselves again!

Interstate 80 and 680 are used by motorists and truckers from all over the country.
Likewise, Highway 12 is a major east-west route for Napa and Sacramento counties. Why
are we ALONE being asked to fix the problems?

This regressive tax scheme takes a bigger percentage of a low or middle-income person's
take-home pay. It will cost the average family $10,000 over the next 23 years. When you
add this NEW TAX to all the other tax and bond measures on the ballot, you'll be giving
well over half your annual income to some level of government! ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!

Tell the bureaucrats to find a better solution. VOTE NO on Measure E

SAY ''NO" TO MORE TAXES! <againstend>

<rebutagainst> REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST MEASURE E

Let’s end gridlock ourselves and vote Yes on Measure E.

In 1998, we told the politicians to replace the 1-80/680 interchange, fix our local streets and
roads, add Solano County’s first commuter rail to BART and expand special transportation
services for seniors and the disabled.

Members of the Citizens Advisory Committee have spent two years creating a traffic relief
plan in Measure E to lock down our transportation tax dollars specifically to complete these
projects.

The League of Women Voters in Solano County and Chambers of Commerce from Vacaville
to Vallejo support Measure E because it creates a Citizens Oversight Committee to ensure
our tax dollars are spent only on the traffic relief projects in Measure E - not bureaucracy.

The Napa-Solano Central Labor Council supports Measure E because workers who commute
shouldn’t have to sit in traffic along 1-80/680 any longer than they have to.

Measure E WILL help Solano County get the state and federal matching funds it deserves
to complete all of our transportation priorities without delay.

This is our chance to do something about traffic. Measure E gives us the traffic relief options
we have demanded: End gridlock at 1-80/680, Fix damaged and unsafe roads, Add commuter
rail to BART and Expand services for seniors and the disabled.

Our Sheriff and firefighters work overtime to keep the people safe on 1-80/680. That’s why
they support Measure E.

Let’s take control of traffic relief now! Vote by mail or on November 5th. Vote Yes on
Measure E. <rebutagainstend>

SOLANO TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT AUTHORITY
EXPENDITURE PLAN
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Regional Priorities of the Plan

The Solano Transportation Improvement Authority Expenditure Plan will guide the expenditure
of an estimated $800 million to $1 billion in county transportation funds generated through
a half-cent transportation sales tax over the next 20 years, if approved by Solano County
voters in the November 2002 election. This Plan was developed to address Solano County’s
most immediate congestion relief needs and to implement a countywide transportation system
to support our quality of life and economic vitality in the future.

The Plan funds the major priority projects identified by the public throughout Solano County
and its seven cities. The Plan provides critical funds for the 1-80/680/SR 12 interchange,
and the 1-80 and SR 12 corridors. It provides funds directly to Solano County’s seven cities
and the County to maintain our local streets and roads. In recognition of our aging population,
the Plan expands special transportation services for seniors and people with disabilities. It
provides a balance between roadways and transit by funding Commuter Rail to BART and
Sacramento, Express Bus Service on the 1-80/680/780 Corridor, and the Baylink Ferry System.

What Specifically is in the Plan

The total net revenue from the sales tax estimated to be generated for the 20 -Year Expenditure
Plan is between $800 million to $1 billion. This amount will double the projected transportation
funds available for Solano County’s priority transportation projects and programs over the
next 20 years from all available transportation funding sources. In addition, it will attract
significant increases in regional, state and federal matching funds for the priority projects
identified in the Plan.

Funding allocation percentages (%) for each of the Plan’s program categories and projects

is listed in Appendix A.

What is in the Plan by Commute Corridor?

The Solano Transportation Improvement Authority Expenditure Plan targets traffic relief projects
in every commute corridor in the County. The commute options for each corridor is a
combination of highway, transit, rail, roadway and alternative modes.

How the Plan was Developed

The Solano Transportation Improvement Authority Expenditure Plan was developed with
extensive public input. The Plan was developed building upon the framework and needs
assessments identified by the Solano Transportation Authority (STA) in its recently completed
Comprehensive Transportation Plan. A total of 14 public input meetings (2 in each city) were
held throughout Solano County over an 18 month period. A 50 member Community Advisory
Committee representing diverse interest groups solicited public input at four public input
meetings and provided input to the Solano Transportation Improvement Authority (STIA) prior
to the Plan’s development. Representatives from business groups, the senior community,
environmental groups, trade unions, transit, highways, and the disabled served on the
Community Advisory Committee. Further input was sought from civic groups and the cities
and County of Solano to ensure the diverse transportation needs of Solano County would
be served. The Solano County Board of Supervisors and City Councils for the seven cities
held public meetings and approved the final Plan.

Citizen’s Oversight Committee

A Citizen’s Oversight Committee has been created with 21 representatives to review the
expenditures of the proposed sales tax measure. The members of the Committee will be
nominated by various community and interest groups and will provide direct input to the
Solano Transportation Improvement Authority.

MEASURE E

SOLANO TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT AUTHORITY
EXPENDITURE PLAN

The Solano Transportation Improvement Authority Expenditure Plan will guide the expenditure
of an estimated $800 million to $1 billion in county transportation funds generated through
a half-cent transportation sales tax over the next 20 years, if approved by Solano County
voters in the November 2002 election. The Plan is divided into three program categories -
Countywide Priority Projects, Return to Source Funds for Local Road and Street Rehabilitation,
and Fast Track Congestion Relief and Safety Program.

Countywide Priority Projects

The Plan provides funds for Countrywide Priority Projects to provide traffic relief in commute
corridors throughout Solano County. These funds are allocated among four distinct program
categories: 1. Highway Program, 2. Transit Program, 3. Commuter Rail Program, and 4.
Alternative Modes Program.

Highway Program

The Highway Program is comprised of four specific highway projects: the 1-80/1-680/ SR 12
Interchange, the 1-80 Corridor, the SR 12 Corridor, and SR 113 Safety Projects.

1.	I-80/I-680/SR 12 Interchange

These funds are intended to provide congestion relief, operational enhancements and
safety improvements for the I-80/I-680/SR 12 Interchange as defined by segment 1 of the
1-80/680/780 Corridor Study approved by the Solano Transportation Authority.

2.	1-80 Corridor Improvements (Vallejo to Dixon)

These funds are intended to provide congestion relief, operational enhancements and
safety improvements for the 1-80 Corridor from the Carquinez Bridge to the Yolo County line.
Eligible projects for this funding shall be defined by segments 2, 5, 6 and 7 of the I-
80/680/780 Corridor Study approved by the Solano Transportation Authority. Improvements
can include, but are not limited to, HOV lanes and direct entrances and access points to
HOV lanes.

3.	SR 12 (Jameson Canyon and 1-80 to the Sacramento River)

These funds are intended to provide congestion relief, operational enhancements and
safety improvements on the SR 12 Corridor from the Napa County line to the Rio Vista
Bridge. Examples of eligible projects include the SR 12 (Jameson Canyon) improvements
and the projects identified in the SR 12 Major Investment Study approved by the Solano
Transportation Authority. Interchange improvements with safe access for pedestrians and
bicyclists are eligible for funding as part of this project.

4.	SR 113 (Safety Improvements adjacent to Dixon)

These funds are intended to provide operational and safety improvements for State
Route 113 located near and adjacent to the City of Dixon. The Authority shall allocate these
funds consistent with the projects to be identified in the SR 113 Major Investment Study
and as determined by the Solano Transportation Authority.

Transit Program

The Plan provides funds for four specific transit programs: Senior and Disabled Transit
Service, Express Bus Service on the 1-80/680/780 Corridors, Baylink Ferry Service, and
Local Transit

1.	Senior and Disabled Transit Service

These funds are intended to improve paratransit service for senior and disabled
persons, including additional service, new vehicles and taxi script. These funds will be
allocated consistent with the transit capital and operating plan developed by the Solano
Transportation Authority in cooperation with the Solano County Paratransit Coordinating
Council and the Solanolinks Transit Consortium.

2.	Express Bus Service (1-80/1-680/1-780 Corridors)

These funds are intended to provide commuter transit service on the 1-80, 680 and
1-780 corridors. These funds will focus on transit services on major commute corridors and
be consistent with the Transit Element of the Comprehensive Transportation Plan and I-
80/680/780 Corridor Transit Study adopted by the Solano Transportation Authority. These
funds shall be used for the purchase and operations of transit vehicles to relieve traffic
congestion in Solano County and for the capital costs for intermodal stations along the I-
80 Corridor in Fairfield, Vacaville and Vallejo as determined by the Solano Transportation
Authority.

3.	Baylink Ferry Service

These funds are intended to support and enhance the ferry commuter transit service
for the Baylink Ferry Service paralleling the 1-80 Corridor including the existing ferry service
in Vallejo. These funds shall be used for the purchase and operation of ferry transit and
vehicles to relieve traffic congestion in Solano County as determined by the Solano
Transportation Authority. Funds shall also be allocated for the capital costs for the Vallejo
Station intermodal facility and ferry maintenance facility. Eligible projects must be consistent
with the Short Range Transit Plan adopted by the City of Vallejo and the Transit Element of
the Comprehensive Transportation Plan adopted by the Solano Transportation Authority.

4.	Local Transit

These funds are intended to provide new and improved local transit service throughout
Solano County and to connect major commute corridors and transit hubs, intermodal centers,
regional transit facilities and major employment centers. Solano Transportation Authority, in
cooperation with the SolanoLinks Transit Consortium and local transit operators, shall develop
a coordinated program for projects and programs eligible for funding. This program will
encompass all areas of the County, will involve affected jurisdictions, will focus on providing
a greater span of service and filling service gaps in order to provide better connectivity
between local transit and major commute corridors and transit hubs, include capacity
expansions to address overcrowding and will endeavor to provide a viable alternative to the
single-occupant vehicle for intra-County travel.

Examples of projects and programs eligible for funding in the Local Transit program include

A.	Services designed to improve local travel and coordination among eligible
transit operators, address the needs of the transit departments and to strengthen the
linkages between transit service areas and linkages to rail stations, intermodal hubs,
and regional transit service in the County;

B.	Transit services connecting to major commute corridors to assist in relieving
peak-period traffic congestion and peak hours overcrowding on intercity and intracity
bus service;

C.	Transit services to assist in alleviating traffic during major highway construction
projects;

D.	Transit services that focus on linkages between park and ride lots, intermodal
centers, educational and governmental centers, residential areas and job centers; and

E.	Transit services within and connecting all cities in Solano County.

The Local Transit funds shall fund projects and programs to alleviate traffic congestion in
Solano County; for the purchase and operation of transit vehicles; for transit operations,
maintenance, and capital programs; and to assist operators in the implementation of developed
plans. Transit projects and programs eligible for these funds shall be consistent with the
Transit Element of the Comprehensive Transportation Plan adopted by the Solano
Transportation Authority and as determined by the Solano Transportation Authority.

Commuter Rail Program

The Plan provides funds for three specific rail projects: Commuter Rail to BART, Commuter
Rail to Sacramento, and Expanded Capitol Corridor Rail Service.

1.	Commuter Rail to BART

These funds are intended to provide direct commuter rail services from Solano County
connecting to the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District (BART) system in Contra
Costa. These funds shall be allocated based on the BART/Contra Costa/Solano Commuter
Rail Study and subject to the approval of the Solano Transportation Authority. Funds shall
be allocated for the necessary train sets, track improvements, and operating funds to operate
this commuter service. The funds shall also be allocated for the capital costs for rail stations
in Fairfield/Vacaville, Benicia and Dixon as determined by the Solano Transportation Authority.

2.	Commuter Rail to Sacramento

These funds are intended to provide direct commuter rail service from Solano County
connecting to Davis, Sacramento and Auburn. Eligible projects must be consistent with the
Auburn-Dixon Regional Rail Study and Transit Element of the Comprehensive Transportation

3.	Expanded Capitol Corridor Rail Service

These funds are intended to support, enhance, and expand in Solano County the
inter-city rail services operated by the Capitol Corridors Joint Powers Board and provide
congestion relief in Solano County. The Authority shall allocate these funds for necessary
track improvements to expand and accelerate the provision of Inter-city Rail Service in
Solano County consistent with the Transit Element of the Comprehensive Transportation Plan
approved by the Solano Transportation Authority and the capital improvements priorities
adopted by the Capitol Corridor Joint Powers Board.

Alternative Modes Program

The Plan provides funds for four specific Alternative Modes Programs: Pedestrian and Transit
Friendly Downtowns, Environmental Mitigation, Bicycle and Pedestrian Trails, and Park and
Ride Lots/Rideshare.

1.	Pedestrian & Transit Friendly Downtowns (Transportation for Livable Communities)

These funds will fund pedestrian and transit friendly downtown projects and support
alternatives to single-occupancy vehicles trips. Examples of eligible projects are transit centers,
downtown and transit corridor pedestrian and streetscape improvements, transit centers and
projects adjacent to residential and employment centers and bicycle and pedestrian trail
connections to downtowns. The projects eligible for these funds must be consistent with the
candidate projects identified in the Alternative Modes Element of the Comprehensive
Transportation Plan adopted by the Solano Transportation Authority and/or the Transportation
for Livable Communities Program developed by the Solano Transportation Authority.

2.	Environmental Mitigation (transportation project related)

These funds will provide environmental mitigation for transportation related projects
included in the Solano County Transportation Improvement Expenditure Plan. These funds
are not intended to replace funds required for project-specific environmental mitigation, but
are intended to supplement and enhance project-specific mitigation as determined by the
Solano Transportation Authority.

3.	Bicycle/Pedestrian Trails

These funds will fund countywide bicycle and pedestrian trail projects and support
alternative mode commute options for single occupant drivers. The bicycle projects eligible

Alternative Modes Element of the Comprehensive Transportation Plan developed in
coordination with the Solano Transportation Authority’s Bicycle Advisory Committee and
adopted by the Solano Transportation Authority. The pedestrian trails projects eligible for
these funds shall be in accordance with the Countywide Trails Plan component of the Alternative
Modes Element of the Comprehensive Transportation Plan developed in coordination with
the Solano Transportation Authority’s Trails Advisory Committee and adopted by the Solano
Transportation Authority.

4.	Park and Ride Lots/Rideshare

These funds will provide and promote use of commute alternatives. The Plan shall
annually allocate tax revenue to the Solano Transportation Authority’s Solano Napa Commuter
Information (SNCI) Program to provide rideshare programs and incentives consistent with
the annual SNCI work program approved by the Solano Transportation Authority. In addition,
local jurisdictions and transit operators will be eligible to seek funds for park and ride lots
from this program category. Park and ride lot projects eligible for these funds shall be
consistent with the Alternative Modes Element of the Comprehensive Transportation Plan
adopted by the Solano Transportation Authority.

Return to Source Local Road Rehabilitation Program

The Plan provides funds for maintenance and rehabilitation of local streets and roads purposes
to be allocated annually to all local jurisdictions in Solano County on a formula basis. Each
city and Solano County will receive an annual allocation based on a formula of 60% population
and 40% centerline miles.

Return to Source - Fast Track Congestion Relief and Safety Program

The Plan specifically commits to early funding of $38 million for Fast Track Congestion Relief
and Safety Program projects during the first five years from passage of this measure by the
voters of Solano County. Funds made available for this program shall be allocated annually
to all local jurisdictions within the first five years of the measure for projects that will provide
congestion relief or improve safety and that are approved by the city council or Board of
Supervisors for the respective jurisdiction. Examples of eligible “Fast Track” projects include
local roadway improvements, local interchange improvements, Comprehensive Transportation
Plan/downtown improvements, local transit projects and local safety projects.

Funds available for this program shall be allocated in the following manner:

1.	Large cities, consisting of Fairfield, Vacaville and Vallejo, shall each receive a total of
$6 million per jurisdiction for all Fast Track projects within such jurisdiction for the five year

such jurisdiction for the five-year period.

4.	Travis Air Force Base access improvements (local roadways for the North and South
Gates) shall receive a total of $3 million for the 5 year period, allocated to the local agency
with jurisdiction over the right of way upon which the improvements are to be constructed.

Funding allocation for Expenditure Plan based on estimated $1 billion in revenue over 20-
year period of service. Revenue generated may vary between $800 million and 1 billion
dollars. The allocation for each project is based on % of the revenue generated.

of fair share shall consider all reasonably relevant factors including the degree to which
Solano County is receiving its statutory county minimum funding for all budgeted, expended,
and programmed State funds and federal funds available for capital projects and operating
subsidies. The policies and project approval actions of the California Transportation
Commission, the State Department of Transportation (hereafter referred to as Caltrans) and
the federal Department of Transportation (e.g., Federal Highway Administration and Federal
Transit Administration) will also be reviewed to ensure that Solano County is receiving full
consideration in the allocation of any additional uncommitted State and Federal funding.
Part of the certification shall include a finding relative to whether or not any State or Federal

SECTION 6. PROGRAM PROCEDURES.

A.	It is the intent of the Legislature and the Authority that revenues provided from
this Ordinance be used to supplement existing revenues being used for transportation
improvements and programs. Each local jurisdiction receiving funds pursuant to Section 5
shall meet the requirements of that section. Under State enabling legislation, funds generated
pursuant to are to be used to supplement and not replace existing local revenues used for
transportation purposes. To meet these requirements, a jurisdiction must demonstrate
maintenance of a minimum level of local street and road expenditures in conformance with
the requirements below.

B.	The local jurisdiction shall expend each fiscal year from its general fund for street
and highway purposes an amount not less than the annual average of its expenditures from
its general fund during the 1999-2000, 2000-2001, and 2001-2002 fiscal years, as reported
to the Controller pursuant to Streets and Highways Code section 2151. For purposes of this
section, in calculating a local jurisdiction's annual general fund expenditures and its average
general fund expenditures for the 1999-2000, 2000-2001, and 2001-2002 fiscal years, any
unrestricted funds which the local jurisdiction may expend at its discretion shall be considered
expenditures from the general fund except that specific funds such as vehicle in-lieu tax
revenues and revenues from fines and forfeitures which have traditionally been used for
other purposes such as supporting the costs of providing public safety services, and any
Return to Source funds expended for streets and highway purposes, shall not be considered
expenditures from the general fund.

1.	If a local jurisdiction fails to comply with the maintenance of effort
requirements in a particular fiscal year, the local jurisdiction may expend during that fiscal
year and the following fiscal year, a total amount that is not less than the total amount
required to be expended for those years for purposes of complying with its maintenance of
effort requirement.

a.	At the end of the first fiscal year in which the local jurisdiction does
not expend the amount required, the local jurisdiction shall have its Return to Source distribution
reduced by the amount by which the jurisdiction has not met its required maintenance of effort.

b.	Provided the local jurisdiction has met the requirement of this
subdivision to expend an amount in the two-year period sufficient to meet its maintenance
of effort obligation for such two-year period, the amount withheld shall be distributed to the
local jurisdiction, without interest, following the end of the next fiscal year. Such distribution
shall be referred to herein as the "make-up payment."

2.	Any local jurisdiction which fails to comply with its maintenance of effort
requirement, using the two-year period, shall have its Return to Sources funding reduced
by the aggregate amount by which the jurisdiction failed to meet its required maintenance
of effort for such two-year period.

a.	The amount of the second year distribution shall be adjusted as
follows: (a) if the local jurisdiction's second year maintenance of effort expenditures are less
than or equal to its required maintenance of effort for such year, the second year distribution
shall be reduced by the amount, if any, by which the second year maintenance of effort
requirement exceeds the local jurisdiction's actual expenditures; (b) if the local jurisdiction’s
second year maintenance of effort expenditures are greater than its required maintenance
of effort for such year, but less than an amount which, together with its actual first year
maintenance of effort expenditures, would be equal to or greater than its two year maintenance
of effort requirement, the amount of the second year distribution shall be increased by the
amount by which the local jurisdiction's actual second year maintenance of effort expenditures
exceed its required maintenance of effort for such year.

b.	Any remaining undistributed funds shall revert to the Authority for
allocation to projects contained in the Expenditure Plan which are not fully funded and which
are of regional significance.

C.	The Authority may request fiscal data from local jurisdictions, in addition to data
provided pursuant to Streets and Highways Code Section 2151 for the 1999-2000, 2000-
2001, and 2001-2002 fiscal years. Each local jurisdiction shall furnish the data to the Authority
not later than 120 days after receiving the request. The Authority may withhold payments
to local jurisdictions which do not comply with requests for information or which provide
incomplete information.

D.	At the conclusion of each fiscal year each local jurisdiction shall verify compliance
with subdivision C. Subject to compliance with the provisions of subdivision C and to any
adjustment in the amount of such payments in accordance with this Section 6, the Authority
shall distribute Return to Source payments pursuant to Section 5 of this Ordinance.

E.	For any local jurisdiction incorporated after July 1,1999, the Authority shall calculate
the annual average of expenditures pursuant to subdivision C for the period that the local
jurisdiction was incorporated between July 1, 1999 and June 30, 2002 or for the first three
years that the local jurisdiction was incorporated or an amount based on the average of the
other cities in Solano County, whichever is greater.

F.	Revenues from a fee imposed or contribution first received by a local jurisdiction on
or after January 1, 2002 which are used on or after July 1, 2002, by that local jurisdiction
for maintenance or improvement purposes on its streets and highways shall be considered
as general fund expenditures for the purposes of compliance with the provisions of this
Section in the fiscal year in which such expenditures are made.

G.	Establishment of a Maintenance of Effort Committee

1.	The Authority finds and declares all of the following:

a.	That this Ordinance provides that a portion of monies received from
the retail transactions and use tax imposed by this Ordinance be returned to local jurisdictions
for use on local, subregional and/or regional transportation improvements and maintenance
projects, subject to compliance with the provisions of this Ordinance.

b.	As required by the statutes pursuant to which the Authority is
organized and in order to provide assurances to the voters in Solano County that such street
maintenance and improvements revenues would be used for increased transportation
expenditures and not be used to relieve local jurisdiction general fund contributions for
transportation, a maintenance of effort requirement was included in Section 6 of the Ordinance.

c.	Due to the complexity of local jurisdiction financing practices, it is
not practicable to adopt a countywide ordinance that accurately identifies local jurisdiction
funding sources and practices for all occasions.

d.	It is the intent of the Authority that an impartial committee be formed
to evaluate and to make recommendations for action by the Authority with respect to unusual
local jurisdiction funding practices and make adjustments to the maintenance of effort
requirements of Section 6 of the Ordinance without violating objectives of that Section.

2.	A local jurisdiction seeking a modification of its maintenance of effort
requirement pursuant to this Section may request that Authority staff review the request and
make a recommendation for action to the Authority.

3.	If the local jurisdiction asserts and the Authority finds that the requested
determination would involve sensitive policy or administrative issues, the Authority may appoint
a Maintenance of Effort Committee to review the request and to make a recommendation
for action to the Authority. The committee would be comprised of the following five members:

a.	Two (2) members appointed from the membership of the Solano
Transportation Authority Technical Advisory Committee and selected by the members of such
committee.

b.	Two (2) members appointed by the Solano County City Managers
and County Administrator Association; each such appointee shall be a finance director or
city manager of a local jurisdiction.

c.	One (1) member appointed from the membership of the Citizen
Oversight Committee of the Authority and selected by the members of such committee.

4.	The Maintenance of Effort Committee chair shall be selected from among
the members of the committee by vote of a majority of the members of the committee.

5.	Any local jurisdiction wishing to adjust its maintenance of effort requirement
shall submit to the Authority a request for adjustment and the necessary documentation to
justify the adjustment. The Authority staff, or, if the Authority determines and finds that it is
necessary to refer the matter to a committee, the Maintenance of Effort Committee, shall
review the request and shall make a recommendation to the Authority. Recommendations
shall be advisory only and shall not bind the Authority to any course of action. Taking into
consideration the recommendation, the Authority may adjust the annual average of
expenditures for the 1999-2000, 2000-2001, and 2001-2002 fiscal years reported pursuant
to Streets and Highways Code Section 2151. The Authority shall make an adjustment if one
or more of the following conditions exist:

a.	The local jurisdiction has undertaken one or more major capital
projects during those fiscal years that required accumulating unrestricted revenues to support
the project during one or more fiscal years.

b.	A source of unrestricted revenue used to support the major capital
project or projects is no longer available to the local jurisdiction and the local jurisdiction
lacks authority to continue the unrestricted funding source.

c.	One or more sources of unrestricted revenues that were available
to the local jurisdiction is producing less than 95 percent of the amount produced in those

fiscal years, and the reduction is not caused by any discretionary action of the local jurisdiction.

The amount of the adjustment shall be limited to the proportionate impact of
extraordinary expenditures as set forth in paragraph 1 or the reduced revenue as set forth
in paragraphs 2 and 3.

6.	Because of the loss to local jurisdictions of unrestricted revenues for road
maintenance and improvements due to the diversion of property tax revenues by the State
Legislature in order to balance the State budget; and in light of the potential impacts of the
requirements of Proposition 218 with respect to the establishment and maintenance of
assessment districts and fee programs to defray revenue lost as noted above, the Authority
will consider requests for adjustments to the expenditure requirements of local jurisdictions
to address these problems. Accordingly:

a.	Any local jurisdiction may request an adjustment in its expenditure
requirement if a calculation of its maintenance of effort requirement on the basis of (i) the
ratio of population and street mileage of such local jurisdiction, weighted 50% to each, to
the total population and street mileage within the entire county, (ii) multiplied by the total of
average expenditures of all jurisdictions within the County, results in a lower requirement
than that calculated based on an average of expenditures for fiscal years 1999-2000, 2000-
2001, and 2001-2002 as determined by the Authority. For purposes of making the calculation
provided herein, population data will be based on the 2000 census.

b.	The Authority may reduce the local jurisdiction’s expenditure
requirement pursuant to a request under this subdivision by an amount not in excess of the
difference between (i) the amount required to be expended by such local jurisdiction as set
forth in Section 6.C and (ii) the amount that would be required based on the weighted road
miles-population calculation described in subdivision 1 above.

c.	In determining the amount of the reduction in such local jurisdiction's
expenditure requirement, if any, the Authority may consider factors such as evidence that
the amount of expenditures in the base years exceeded average expenditures over a multi-
year period, the stage of development or "build-out" of the local jurisdiction, and hardship
factors.

d.	No adjustment to a local jurisdiction's expenditure amount pursuant
to this subdivision shall require any adjustment to the expenditure requirement of any other
local jurisdiction.

e.	No adjustment under this subdivision shall affect the right of a local
jurisdiction to seek an adjustment under subdivision E above, and no adjustment approved
pursuant to subdivision E above shall affect the right of a local jurisdiction to seek an
adjustment under this subdivision.

7.	The request reviewing body may recommend, and the Authority may also
grant a reduction in expenditure requirements for a single fiscal year under extraordinary
circumstances, if both the following conditions are met:

a.	The local jurisdiction submits a request for adjustment and the
necessary documentation to justify the adjustment.

b.	The local jurisdiction has suffered an extraordinary loss of revenues
or incurred an extraordinary expenditure due to circumstances beyond its control.

8.	Members of a Maintenance of Effort Committee shall serve without
compensation, but may be reimbursed for travel expenses incurred as a result of attending
meetings of the committee. The Authority shall administer the provisions of this section.
SECTION 7. RETURN TO SOURCE PURPOSES AND PROCEDURES. In order to receive
Return to Source Funds, local jurisdictions must meet the requirements of the maintenance
of effort program set forth in Section 6 and in specific requirements of the program. The
Authority shall develop administrative requirements, in consultation with local jurisdictions,
to implement the program.


SECTION 8. AMENDMENTS TO THE EXPENDITURE PLAN.

A.	The Authority may annually review and propose amendments to the Expenditure
Plan to provide for the use of additional federal, State and local funds, to account for
unexpected revenues, or to take into consideration unforeseen circumstances. The Authority

override of the amendment(s) from a majority of the cities representing a majority of the

requires the establishment of an annual appropriations limit for certain governmental entities.
The maximum annual appropriations limit for the Authority has been established as $500
million (50% of the total estimated sales tax revenues in 2002 dollars). The appropriations
limit shall be subject to adjustment as provided by law including, but not limited to, annual
adjustments reflecting changes in population and inflation. All expenditures of the retail

secure funding for the completion and improvement of the priority regional projects with the
California Transportation Commission, transit operators and other interested and affected
parties for the purpose of integrating its transportation improvements with other planned
improvements and operations impacting the County. In addition, the Authority shall seek all
ways to expedite the completion of Expenditure Plan projects, the implementation of which
is the responsibility of other agencies. Use of acceleration as described in Section 5.A.1.e
as well as supporting and advocating for Caltrans to contract out are both means through
which the Authority can work to achieve timely project implementation.

SECTION 22. ALLOCATION OF RELEASED FUNDS. If additional funds become available
for a specific project or projects on the Expenditure Plan, the Authority may reallocate the
retail transaction and use tax funds released by the receipt of those additional funds. In the

projects and programs that provide congestion relief in the geographic region that received
the additional funds. Second priority shall be given to other projects and programs within
the affected geographic region that may be placed on the Expenditure Plan through the
amendment process described in Section 8. Third priority shall be given to all other Expenditure
Plan projects and programs. Fourth priority shall be given to other projects of regional
significance that may be placed on the Expenditure Plan through the amendment process
described in Section 8.

SECTION 23. ALLOCATION OF EXCESS FUNDS. In the event that the retail transactions
and use tax revenues generated by this Ordinance are greater than projected or contingency
fund requirements are less than projected, the Authority may allocate those excess funds.
Determination of when the contingency funds become excess funds will be established by
a process to be developed by the Authority. In the allocation of excess funds, the Authority
shall give first priority to Expenditure Plan projects and programs, and second priority to
other projects of regional significance that are consistent with the Comprehensive

Transportation Plan of the Authority and may be placed on the Expenditure Plan through
the amendment process described in Section 8.
