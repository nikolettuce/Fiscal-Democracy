that can be used for any legitimate governmental purpose; it is not a commitment to any particular
action. As such, under CEQA Guidelines section 15378(b)(4), the tax is not a project within the
meaning of CEQA because it creates a government funding mechanism that does not involve any
commitment to any specific project that may result in a potentially significant physical impact on the
environment. If revenue from the tax were used for a purpose that would have either such effect, the
city would undertake the required CEQA review for that particular project. Therefore, pursuant to
CEQA Guidelines section 15060 CEQA analyses is not required.

AN ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF RIALTO, CALIFORNIA, TO
EXTEND THE UTILITY USER TAX FOR FIVE YEARS

THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY OF RIALTO DO ORDAIN AS FOLLOWS:

Section 1. The provisions of Chapter 3.16 of the Rialto Municipal Code, as adopted by
Ordinances 1340, 1398 and 1407, are hereby extended in their entirety for five additional years by
amending the last sentence of Section 3.16.230 of the Rialto Municipal Code to read as follows:

“This chapter shall foe of no further force and effect at eleven fifty-nine p.m.

(11:59 p.m.) on June 30,2018.”

Section 2. The provisions of this Ordinance are severable and if any provision, clause,
sentence, word or part thereof is held illegal, invalid, unconstitutional, or inapplicable to any person
or circumstances, such illegality, invalidity, unconstitutionality, or inapplicability shall not affect or
impair any of the remaining provisions, clauses, sentences, sections, words or parts thereof of the
ordinance or their applicability to other persons or circumstances.

Section 3. This Ordinance shall be considered adopted on the date that the City Council
declares the results of the election at which it was voted upon and shall be effective ten days
thereafter.

Section 4. The City Clerk of the City of Rialto shall cause this Ordinance to be posted in
the manner required by law.

Section 5. The approval of this Ordinance is exempt from the California Environmental
Quality Act (Public Resources Code §§ 21000 et seq., “CEQA,” and 14 Cal. Code Reg. §§ 15000 et
seq., “CEQA Guidelines”). This Ordinance amends the City’s Business License Tax, which is a
general tax that can be used for any legitimate governmental purpose; it is not a commitment to any
particular action. As such, under CEQA Guidelines section 15378(b)(4), the Ordinance is not a
project within the meaning of CEQA because it creates a government funding mechanism that does
not involve any commitment to any specific project that may result in a potentially significant
physical impact on the environment. If revenue from the tax were used for a purpose that would have
either such effect, the city would undertake the required CEQA review for that particular project.
Therefore, pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15060 CEQA analyses is not required.
