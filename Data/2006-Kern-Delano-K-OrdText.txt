Section 3. PURPOSE. This ordinance is adopted to achieve the following, among
other purposes, and directs that the provisions hereof be interpreted in order to
accomplish those purposes:

A.	To impose a retail transactions and use tax in accordance with the
provisions of Part 1.6 (commencing with Section 7251) of Division 2 of
the Revenue and Taxation Code and Section 7285.91 of Part 1.7 of
Division 2 which authorizes the City to adopt this tax ordinance which
shall be operative if a two-thirds majority of the electors voting on the

that purpose.

B.	To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that incorporates
provisions identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the State of
California insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with the
requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the
Revenue and Taxation Code.

C.	To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that imposes a tax and
provides a measure therefore that can be administered and collected by the
State Board of Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as
practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from, the existing
statutory and administrative procedures followed by the State Board of
Equalization in administering and collecting the California State Sales and
Use Tax.

D.	To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that can be
administered in a maimer that will be, to the greatest degree possible,
consistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and
Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting the transactions and use
taxes, and at the same time, minimize the burden of record keeping upon
persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this ordinance.

E.

To allow the City to issue bonds payable from the proceeds of the tax.

Section 4.	CONTRACT WITH STATE.	Prior to the operative date, the City

shall contract with the State Board of Equalization to perform all function incident to the
administration and operation of the transactions and use tax ordinance; provided, that if
the City shall not have contracted with the State Board of Equalization prior to the
operative date, it shall nevertheless so contract and in such a case the operative date shall
be the first date of the first calendar quarter following the execution of such a contract.

Section 5.	TRANSACTION TAX RATE.	For the privilege of selling tangible

personal property at retail, a tax is hereby imposed upon all retailers in the incorporated
territory of the City at the rate of one half of one percent of the gross receipts of any
retailer from the sale of all tangible personal property sold at retail in said territory on and
after the operative date of this ordinance.

Section 6. PLACE OF SALE. For the purposes of this ordinance, all retail sales
are consummated at the place of business of the retailer unless the tangible personal
property sold is delivered by the retailer or his agent to an out-of-state destination or to a
common carrier for delivery to an out-of-state destination. The gross receipts from such
sales shall include delivery charges, when such charges are subject to the State sales and
use tax, regardless of the place to which delivery is made. In the event a retailer has no
permanent place of business in the State or has more than one place of business, the place
or places at which the retailer sales are consummated shall be determined under rules and
regulations to be prescribed and adopted by the State Board of Equalization.
