FIELDBROOK GLENDALE COMMUNITY SERVICES DISTRICT
ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE K

The benefits a community gains from being served by a well trained, well equipped fire department are immeasurable. While
protection of life and property is the most obvious recognized benefit, home insurance premiums and property values are also af-
fected by the quality of the local fire and medical services. Strong community support and the active pursuit of government grants
has allowed Fieldbrook’s all-volunteer fire department to maintain up-to-date fire trucks, rescue apparatus and emergency medical
equipment. This has resulted in high quality service to residents within the fire district and improved safety for the volunteers who
provide those services.

Today’s modern firefighting vehicles have increased in size significantly from those for which the existing fire station was originally
designed. Since the current facility was built nearly a half century ago, several building modifications have occurred to address
the number and size of the department’s vehicles. Unfortunately, we have finally reached a point where space restrictions of the
existing structure are impacting the department’s effectiveness.

An additional $33.00 increase to the current parcel assessment for a ten-year period, utilizing volunteer labor, allows for the
construction of a twenty-seven hundred square foot addition and renovation to the current firehouse. With the majority of the
construction being done by volunteers from the community and the fire department, the total for this project runs one-third the cost
were it to be done by outside contractors.

Every man, woman and child living within the Fieldbrook Fire District stands to benefit from this very modest increase to the
existing assessment. Please show your support for our community and the Fieldbrook Volunteer Fire Department and voters on
Measure K.
