IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL
STALLION SPRINGS COMMUNITY SERVICES DISTRICT
MEASUREZ

A “yes” vote by at least 2/3rds of the voters voting on this measure will
authorize the Board, of Directors of the Stallion Springs Community Services
District to.collect a special tax levied on each parcel of- property located in
the district for the purpose of providing funds for police protection services.
The 2/3rds vote requirement for special taxes is mandated by Article Xlll-A
of the California Constitution.

A special tax is one which is collected for a specific purpose and the pro-
ceeds of the tax may be spent only for the purpose approved by the voters.
In this particular case, the District is requesting authorization from the voters
to collect a special tax for the purpose of providing police protection services.
The ordinance adopted by the Board of Directors of the District provides that
the proceeds of the tax, if approved, will be used by the District solely for
the purposes of obtaining, providing, operating and maintaining police pro-
tection services including supplying equipment or apparatus therefor; paying
the salaries and benefits of police protection personnel; and for.other nec-
essary police protection expenses of the Stallion Springs Community Services
District.:	'•	•:	; 'v	-	'V

The special tax will be collected on each parcel of real property located in
the District in the same manner as property taxes. The Board of Directors
will set the amounts to be levied annually, which cannot exceed limits estab-
lished by the ordinance submitted for voter approval. During the first fiscal
year after the election, improved parcels cannot be assessed more than $75
per year; during the second through fourth fiscal years, improved parcels
cannot be assessed more than $55 per year. Assessments due in subsequent
• fiscal years are also subject to various maximum amounts as provided in the
District's Ordinance. Unimproved parcels are assessed half as much as im-
proved parcels (for example, if the annual assessment for each improved
parcel is $20, the assessment for an unimproved parcel will be $10). The
records of the Kern County Assessor will be determinative of whether or not
a parcel is improved.

The measure also requests authorization to change the appropriations limit
of the District in an amount equal to the amount of special taxes authorized
by the voters. The appropriations limit is required by Article Xlll-B of the
California Constitution and limits the amount of tax money that a governmental
entity may spend in any year. If approved, the appropriations limit will be
■increased for a period of four years.- The increased appropriations limit will
have to be approved again by the voters- after .the .expiration of four years if
the District intends to spend tax revenue in excess of its current appropriations
limit as adjusted for inflation.and population changes over the next four years.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE Z

For more than three years efforts were made to employ a fourth officer,,
but budget restrictions precluded this recognized need.

In 1979 Stallion Springs had about 80 homes and three officers. Today we
have nearly 650 homes with over 300 school children. Since then, the lodge
more than tripled its operation, Boom Town now exists with conference and
recreation facilities. We still have only three officers.

Today our neighborhood patrol coverage is about 45%. Nonpatrol duties like
prisoner transportation, investigation, and criminal court appearances have
increased steadily, now demanding the equivalent of one officer's time. A
fourth officer would increase neighborhood patrol time up to a more accept-
able level; for when neighborhood patrols are increased, traffic problems and
criminal activity decreases.

Reported crime (including child abuse, domestic violence, and residential
burglaries) and personal assistance calls to date have exceeded all of 1991.
Our officers live in the community and are dedicated to the community. They
responded to over 100 personal assistance calls in the first six months of
this year alone. Persona! assistance calls as opposed to criminal complaints
are not normally responded to by police agencies.

Passage of this ordinance will provide a fourth officer, as well as allowing
for officer cross training in badly needed fire protection services. For the first
time our community will be able to provide emergency medical training and
equipment. Emergency medical care is now about 30 minutes away.

To protect our way of life and property values, we must Insure Stallion
Springs does not gain a reputation for high crime and poor services which
are driving residents out of other nearby communities.

We believe the passage of this ordinance will provide security for all of us
in Stallion Springs for the coming years.
