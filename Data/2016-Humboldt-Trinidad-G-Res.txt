WHEREAS, the City of Trinidad is one of the smallest cities in the State of California. With a population of 367, the City has
a very limited tax source of revenue, and

WHEREAS, the City of Trinidad is visited yearly by thousands of tourists and many residents of surrounding communities.
While visitors to the City support the local economy and commerce, residents in the surrounding communities contribute
greatly to many of the civic activities in the City, and

WHEREAS, the high volume of visitors relative to the small number of city residents places a very high burden on services
provided by City's General Fund. These services include, but are not limited to, police and fire protection, street and public
facility services, park, trail and environment maintenance and protection, and services provided by the Town Office.
Additionally, the City also provides significant supporting services of police and fire protection to its surrounding
communities, and

WHEREAS, additional revenue is needed so that the General Fund can meet the increased service demands, and

WHEREAS, in 2004, citizens of Trinidad approved an increase of transaction and use tax by 1% for four years to increase
the General Fund reserve, and in 2008 and again In 2012 the majority of citizens of Trinidad voted in favor of extending the
transaction and use tax by %% (.75%) for an additional four years. Now, the Trinidad City Council proposes to extend this
Increase by four more years to continue to support the capability of the General Fund to provide these services,

NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Trinidad City Council does hereby propose to put the following
Sales Tax measure before the voters at the General Election to be held on November 08, 2016;

Shall a % cent transaction and use tax be continued in the City of Trinidad for four years, starting on April 1.2017.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Sales Tax increase would be collected only within the City limits of
Trinidad and be administered by the California State Board of Equalization; and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the City Clerk will act as the Elections Official.

PASSED AND ADOPTED BY THE TRINIDAD CITY COUNCIL, of Humboldt County of the State of California on May 19,
2016.
