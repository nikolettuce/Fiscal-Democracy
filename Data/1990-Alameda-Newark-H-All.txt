Measure H proposes increasing the Transient Occupancy -Tax for hotel and motel occupants from its
current rate of 6'/a% to

This tax only affects persons using hotel or motel rooms in the City of Newark. At present, the tax is
b'/z'Z of the amount charged for the room and is paid by the visitor as part of the hotel/motel bill. The
owner of the hotel/motel collects the tax and remits it to the City. The City may use the money for
general fund purposes.

The Transient Occupancy Tax has not been increased since 1981.

Adoption of this measure by a majority vote is required by Government Code Section 53720 et. seq.
before the City Council of the City of Newark may adopt the tax increase by adoption of a resolution
of the City of Newark.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE H

THIS MEASURE WILL NOT COST NEWARK RESIDENTS ANY MONEY.

WHAT IS THE TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX (TOT)?

This is a tax which visitors pay on the room charge by hotel/motel operators. This is not a tax paid by
existing residents, homeowners or business operators.

WHERE W ILL THE ADDITIONAL 1% GO?

Transient Occupancy Taxes go into the City's general fund to help support general government services,
such as police and fire protection. The additional 1% will provide the City additional money to provide
those services. This tax increase will allow for a fair and equitable method to assess visitors who place
special demands on the City.

HOW' MUCH DIFFERENCE CAN 1% MAKE?

A IVr increase will not significantly affect a visitor’s hotel bill or the demand for rooms within Newark.
A 1% increase on an assumed S65 room charge will only increase the room rate by 65 cents. This
increase has been discussed with representatives of the hotel/motel industry and the Newark Chamber
of Commerce and they have no objections to it.

A I ck increase will, however, raise needed funds to assist the City in paying for those general municipal
services necessary to maintain a high quality of life; this increase will not affect the local hotel/motel
economy.
