Para los veteranos, garantizare educacion, vivienda, cuidado de la salud con el derecho de tratarse en cualquier hospital, y subsidios de vivienda para los veteranos incapacitados. En cuanto a los derechos civiles, yo apoyo el salario igual para trabajo igual; la vida de los negros es importante; una reforma inmigratoria, en contra de la prohibition de inmigrantes con base en su religion y apoyo los derechos personales de los LGBT (lesbianas, homosexuales, bisexuales y transgeneros). En lo que se refiere al medio ambiente, yo apoyo la preservation del desierto para tres nuevos monumentos nacionales; estoy en contra de la extraction de aguas subterraneas del Desierto Mojave y de las Montanas de San Bernardino y en contra del oleoducto Keystone. Con respecto al comercio, estoy en contra de la Ley de Comercio que exporta empleos americanos al extranjero. “Los americanos primero” constituye mi prioridad y ningun americano expuesto a peligro. Vote por la Dra. Rita para el Congreso.

STATEMENT OF CANDIDATE
FOR DIRECTOR
NORTHERN INYO HEALTHCARE DISTRICT ZONE 1

RICHARD DOW MATTINGLY	AGE:	65

JOHN A. UNGERSMA

OCCUPATION: Retired Senior Naval Officer

Education and Qualifications: As a Trustee of Northern Inyo Healthcare District I
strongly advocated for the construction of a new hospital. With its completion our
community has the ability to fulfill our healthcare needs in the 21st century.

As a senior retired officer in the United States Navy I have faced numerous challenges
in healthcare. I am sure that we will face continuing challenges in the coming years.

I have served on the staff of some 20 hospitals (about half civilian) and two hospital
ships. This experience has equipped me to help lead our Healthcare District through
the opportunities and future crises ahead.

OCCUPATION: General Building Contractor

Education and Qualifications: Northern Inyo Hospital is a first class institution,
staffed by highly qualified medical professionals that serve our community with expert
care. The intention of my becoming a Board Director is to help keep NIH a first class
institution.

A tremendous source of pride is felt by me when driving by and seeing this new
building which we all paid for. As a general building contractor, I helped in the
construction of the Support and Radiology buildings as Assistant Superintendent to
Turner Construction and know from the ground up what we all have. I know many of
the fine staff members from techs to nurses and Doctors, and that they too are proud
of our healthcare facility.

As good as NIH is, it is not without recent travails. The worst of which is a loss of
connection and trust that our community has with the administration and Board of
Directors. It is the responsibility of the Board of Directors to understand the functions of
the hospital and give clear concise direction to the administration and to communicate
openly and honestly with the staff and community members. With your vote this is
what I intend to do.

BALLOT MEASURE G:

ADVISORY VOTE REGARDING MEDICAL CANNABIS

California law permits local governments such as counties to hold advisory elections
for the purpose of allowing voters to voice their opinions on substantive policy issues.
The Inyo County Board of Supervisors placed Measure G on the ballot in order to
ascertain voter opinions regarding whether or not the County should establish
regulations allowing medical cannabis (marijuana) businesses to operate within the
unincorporated areas of the County (areas outside the City of Bishop). Because the
measure is advisory only, the election results are in no manner controlling on the
Board of Supervisors.

California permits certain personal use and possession of medical cannabis
throughout the state, but cities and counties are nevertheless able to prohibit or allow
the operation of commercial medical cannabis businesses within their jurisdictions
and to otherwise regulate them. For example, through its power to regulate land
use, a county could adopt zoning ordinances and other land-use regulations allowing
such businesses on certain types of properties in particular areas of the County as
long as any such proposed business first obtains a use permit from the County, which
the County could consider through a public process and then deny or approve in its
discretion with conditions. Inyo County regulations do not currently permit such
businesses anywhere within the unincorporated areas of the County. Note: the Inyo
County Board of Supervisors has no jurisdiction to prohibit or allow such businesses
within the City of Bishop nor on lands under the territorial jurisdiction of a federally-
recognized Indian Tribe.

As noted above, this measure is advisory only and establishes no policy or regulations.
But the Board of Supervisors may choose to consider the election results in determining
whether and to what extent any County communities support the development
of regulations allowing commercial medical cannabis businesses. Any proposed
future regulations would go through noticed public processes before adoption and
implementation by the County.

A “Yes” vote means you support the County developing laws (regulations) authorizing
commercial medical cannabis businesses within the unincorporated areas of the
County.

A “No” vote means you oppose the County developing laws (regulations) authorizing
commercial medical cannabis businesses within the unincorporated areas of the
County.

BALLOT MEASURE H:

ADVISORY VOTE REGARDING RECREATIONAL CANNABIS

California law permits local governments such as counties to hold advisory elections
for the purpose of allowing voters to voice their opinions on substantive policy issues.
The Inyo County Board of Supervisors placed Measure H on the ballot in order to
ascertain voter opinions regarding whether or not the County should establish
regulations allowing recreational cannabis (marijuana) businesses to operate within
the unincorporated areas of the County (areas outside the City of Bishop). Because
the measure is advisory only, the election results are in no manner controlling on the
Board of Supervisors.

California permits certain personal use and possession of medical cannabis
throughout the state, but does not currently permit recreational use of cannabis.
That would change and recreational use would become legal under California law
if the voters approve Proposition 64, the California Marijuana Legalization Initiative
Statute. Even if that happens, however, cities and counties will nevertheless be able
to prohibit or allow the operation of commercial recreational cannabis businesses
within their jurisdictions and to otherwise regulate them (cities and counties already
have that same authority with respect to commercial medical cannabis businesses).
For example, through its power to regulate land use, a county could adopt zoning
ordinances and other land-use regulations allowing such businesses on certain types
of properties in particular areas of the County as long as any such proposed business
first obtains a use permit from the County, which the County could consider through
a public process and then deny or approve in its discretion with conditions. Inyo
County regulations do not currently permit such businesses anywhere within the
unincorporated areas of the County. Note: the Inyo County Board of Supervisors has
no jurisdiction to prohibit or allow such businesses within the City of Bishop nor on
lands under the territorial jurisdiction of a federally-recognized Indian Tribe.

As noted above, this measure is advisory only and establishes no policy or regulations.
But the Board of Supervisors may choose to consider the election results in determining
whether and to what extent any County communities support the development of
regulations allowing commercial recreational cannabis businesses. Any proposed
future regulations would go through noticed public processes before adoption and
implementation by the County.

A “Yes” vote means you support the County developing laws (regulations) authorizing
commercial recreational cannabis businesses within the unincorporated areas of
the County, if Proposition 64 (the California Marijuana Legalization Initiative Statute)
passes.

A “No” vote means you oppose the County developing laws (regulations) authorizing
commercial recreational cannabis businesses within the unincorporated areas of
the County if Proposition 64 (the California Marijuana Legalization Initiative Statute)
passes.

BALLOT MEASURE I: CANNABIS BUSINESS TAX

The Inyo County Board of Supervisors placed Measure I on the ballot. The measure
proposes voter-approval of an Inyo County ordinance (Ordinance No. 1202) imposing
a tax on commercial cannabis (marijuana) businesses in the unincorporated areas of
the County - the areas outside of the City of Bishop. Cannabis businesses are not
currently permitted in such areas of the County and approval of Measure I would
not permit them; rather, approval of Measure I would only impose a tax on any such
businesses that may exist in the future. The tax would not apply to non-commercial
cultivation of cannabis for “personal use” as defined by applicable laws.

If approved by the voters, Ordinance 1202 would impose an initial tax equal to five
percent (5%) of a cannabis businesses’ gross receipts per fiscal year, effective January
1,2017, with cultivation businesses paying not less than the following amounts:

•	businesses cultivating twenty-five hundred (2,500) or fewer square feet of
cannabis would pay not less than twelve hundred and fifty dollars ($1,250) per
“growing cycle” (defined generally as the life of a cannabis plant until harvest)

•	businesses cultivating more than 2,500 square feet and up to five thousand
(5,000) square feet of cannabis would pay not less than twenty-five hundred
dollars ($2,500) per growing cycle

•	businesses cultivating more than 5,000 square feet of cannabis would pay not
less than five thousand dollars ($5,000) per growing cycle.

Beginning July 1, 2020, the ordinance also provides that the 5% initial tax rate on
gross receipts may be increased in two and one half percent (2.5%) increments per
fiscal year, not to exceed a maximum tax rate of twelve and one half percent (12.5%).
Such increases in the tax rate are not automatic; they can only be implemented if
approved by the Board of Supervisors at a regular meeting.

The ordinance further provides the Board with authority to amend or modify the
ordinance, including but not limited to reducing the tax rate or creating additional
exemptions from the tax. Such modifications could be made applicable to any or all
types of commercial cannabis businesses.

The tax would apply to any cannabis businesses operating within the County, including
a business operating illegally (i.e., illegal businesses could not avoid taxation). The
ordinance contains payment and reporting requirements and enforcement provisions
and authorizes the County Treasurer-Tax Collector to administer the tax. The tax is for
general governmental purposes (a “general tax”) and tax revenues would be placed
in the County’s General Fund and used for general County purposes at the discretion
of the Inyo County Board of Supervisors. The tax will go into effect only if Measure I
is approved by a simple majority of the voters voting on the measure at the election.

A “YES” vote on Measure I is a vote in favor of approving Ordinance 1202 and imposing
a tax on commercial cannabis (marijuana) businesses in the unincorporated areas of
Inyo County.

A “NO” vote on Measure I is a vote against approving Ordinance 1202 and against
imposing a tax on commercial cannabis (marijuana) businesses in the unincorporated
areas of Inyo County.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure I (and Ordinance 1202). If
you desire a copy of Measure I (and Ordinance 1202), please call the elections official’s
office at (760) 878-0222 and a copy will be mailed at no cost to you. You may also
access the full text of the measure (and ordinance) on the county Web site at the
following Web site address: http://elections.inyocounty.us/p/what-on-ballot.html.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE I

The State of California is going to begin issuing licenses to regulate the cultivation,
inspection, transport, and sale of medical marijuana per the 2015 Medical Marijuana
Regulation and Safety Act. The Act also establishes a medical marijuana tax estimated
to generate millions of dollars for the state annually.

Even sooner, if Proposition 64 passes on November 8,2016, Californians age 21 and
older will be allowed to possess, transport, and use up to an ounce of marijuana for
recreational purposes. Again, this activity will be taxed by the state.

Counties have the opportunity to levy their own taxes on commercial marijuana
activities taking place in their unincorporated areas. This tax would create a new
and much-needed local funding source for Inyo County by treating the commercial
marijuana industry the same as any other commercial enterprise that places new
demands on already-strained County services.

Even opponents of legalizing marijuana concede the government is missing the boat
on regulating and taxing what is currently a billions-of-dollars-a-year industry mostly
benefiting the black market. Legislative analysts suggest that the State of California
alone stands to gain a billion dollars annually by taxing recreational marijuana
cultivation and sales. For Inyo County, where 95 percent of the land is owned by the
state or federal government and therefore not subject to property tax, and where
economic growth is limited, the opportunity for additional tax revenue is not to be
taken lightly.

Ordinance No. 1202 will enable the County of Inyo to ensure that commercial cannabis
businesses - should these activities take place in Inyo County - will pay their fair
share of taxes for vital County services like public safety, parks, health, education, and
local programs that help our senior citizens and children.

Help us to maintain County services and Vote YES on Measure I.
