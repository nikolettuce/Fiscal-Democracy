ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE G

Marinwood Community Services District needs the com-
munity’s support!

For many years, the Marinwood CSD has increased Fire,
Park, and Recreation services while maintaining a bal-
anced budget and the community benefited from living in
safe neighborhoods with amenities too numerous to list.

Unfortunately, the District begins this fiscal year with a
$350,000 deficit. The principal cause of this financial cri-
sis is Reduced Income, most notably San Rafael’s discon-
tinuation of a contract with the Marinwood FD and
reduced property taxes. The 20-year San Rafael agree-
ment, which brought the District $300,000, was a victim
of the City’s financial struggles. Additionally, our share of
the County’s property tax revenues that funds much of the
District operations has declined by about 5% since 2009 -
a reduction of over $73,000. Following an unsuccessful
attempt to negotiate an equitable agreement with San
Rafael, the community has made it clear to the CSD Board
that it wants to preserve its own, locally controlled. Fire
Department.

Rising costs also pressure the District. We have taken
steps to reduce employee costs, even though our firefight-
ers are among the lowest paid in Marin County. The retire-
ment plan for new hires in the Fire Department has been
reduced and the District is presently working on cost
reductions in employee benefits District-wide.

Cost reduction is only a part of the solution. There is not
enough to be saved in personnel costs, services, and sup-
plies to fill the gap of lost revenue, much less to fund future
capital equipment replacements, such as a fire engine, and
major maintenance. After much deliberation, the CSD
acknowledges that in the next year either increased revenue
from this Special Tax for Fire Protection or dramatic cuts
in services will be required.

We urge you to vote Yes on Measure G!
