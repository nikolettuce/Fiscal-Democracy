IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL
BEAR VALLEY COMMUNITY SERVICES DISTRICT
MEASURE F

,A “Yes” vote by at least two-thirds of the voters voting on this measure will autho-
pe the Board of Directors of the Bear Valley Community Services District (“Dis-
-Tncf) to levy annually a special tax in the amount of seventy five dollars ($75.00)
per parcel of real property located within the boundaries of the District.

The District intends to use the special tax revenues to operate the District’s secu-
rity gate twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week. The proceeds of the
tax will only be used for that purpose.

The proceeds of the tax will be deposited in a separate account. The general man-
ager of the District will file an annual report with the Board of Directors of the Dis-
trict. That report will contain the amount of funds collected and expended and the
status of the use of the funds for the operation of the security gate. In addition, a
separate annual audit will be prepared by an external auditor.

This wording applies to Measure F:

This is an impartial analysis of Measure F. If you want a copy of the District’s reso-
lution ordering the election to vote on Measure F, please call Kern County Elec-
tions at (661) 868-3590 or 1 -800-452-8683 and a copy will be mailed at no cost to
you.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE F
BEAR VALLEY COMMUNITY SERVICES DISTRICT

I,	Robert Amos, a Bear Valley Springs resident and Chairman for the Bear Valley
Springs Improvement Committee (BVSIC), whole-heartedly support Measure: F.

Bear Valley Springs Improvement Committee’s mission is to raise community
awareness and promote voter participation. Although, the committee takes no of-
ficial position on community issues, the committee members are acutely aware of
the funding issues for the gate and as individuals support the proposed levy.

The Bear Valley Springs gate offers security and is the very reason most of its res-
idents choose to live there. Proper funding for the gate is essential and deserves a
vote by its residents.
