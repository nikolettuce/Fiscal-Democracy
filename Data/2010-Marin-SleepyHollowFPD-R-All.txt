COUNTY COUNSEL’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF
MEASURE R

SLEEPY HOLLOW FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT
SPECIAL TAX INCREASE

If this measure is approved by a two-thirds vote,
Sleepy Hollow Fire Protection District would be autho-
rized to continue the four year special tax for parametlic
services in the amount of forty-two dollars ($42) in fiscal
year 2011-2012 to an amount not exceeding fifty-one dol-
lars ($51) in the fourth year per taxable unit or per 1,500
square feet of structure developed parcel in non-residential
use through June 30, 2015, with the appropriations limit
increased by the amount of said tax for the next four years.

s/PATRICK K. FAULKNER
County Counsel

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE R

Since 1982, the voters of Sleepy Hollow have over-
whelmingly approved a special tax to provide paramedic
service. To continue this high standard of emergency med-
ical care for four more years, you must now re-approve
this measure. The initial Ross Valley Paramedic Authority
(RVPA) tax provides for a single ambulance. The demand
for paramedic service from our citizens dictates that ser-
vice levels continue to expand and evolve.

In an effort to minimize the burden on our citizens, the
RVPA has not raised the tax as previously scheduled. Each
year over the past four years, the tax was scheduled to
incrementally increase to a maximum of $48 per living
unit and for each 1,500 square feet of non-residential
developed space. However, we have been able to keep the
tax at a rate of only $42 and meet our cost expectations
while continuing to improving service levels with the
addition of paramedic engine companies and furnishing all
Ross Valley fire agencies with new defibrillation equip-
ment. We again ask that you continue the tax at the $42
rate with the ability, if needed, to raise the tax incremen-
tally each year by $3 to a rate not to exceed $51 (plus fifty
cents County administrative fee) in the fourth year.

Your parcel tax pays for a significant portion of the para-
medic program. Additional funds are collected from med-
ical insurance companies and through billing of non-resi-
dent customers. In addition, your tax covers paramedic
training, the cost of medical supplies and equipment, and
the replacement of ambulance transport units when needed.
Our goal is to continue to provide state-of-the-art para-
medic care in Sleepy Hollow. We need your vote to con-
tinue this vital service. Vote YES on Measure R.
