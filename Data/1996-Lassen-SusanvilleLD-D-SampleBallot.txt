IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL
SUSANVILLE LIBRARY DISTRICT
MEASURE D

This measure would authorize the imposition of a special tax in an amount
not to exceed $28.00 per annum per inhabitable dwelling unit in the territory
proposed to be annexed to the Susanville Library District.

The annual tax would be authorized for an indefinite period beginning in
the 1997-98 fiscal year. The funds raised by the tax will be used to support
library services. The tax requires an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the
ballots cast updn the measure to go into effect. Failure to approve the
special tax will result in termination of the proceedings to annex the proposed
territory into the Susanville Library District.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE D

Welcome to the Library District. In August 1996, at the request of your
neighbors and friends, the library's Board of Directors annexed the Richmond
School District and areas south and west of the City of Susanville. The
library board’s action is conditioned on your acceptance of the same fees
currently paid by city residents.

A "YES" vote on Measure “D" will mean you have joined the library
district. "YES" means you have agreed to support the library. You have
approved expansion of library services to your family and community.

As you go to the polls, the new library is in final construction stages. Your
"YES" vote will assure at least four more hours of library operation per
week. It will bring library staff to Richmond School one day per week. Your
"YES" vote allows the district to move forward with computerized home
and school checkout service for 60,000+ books, periodicals, videos, records,
and other materials. It will also give you and local youth access to books
of other cooperating libraries of the north state.

Beginning in November 1997, you will be billed a total of $28.00 per tax
year to support library operation. This is the maximum assessment level,
but as the library district grows this rate wilt decrease - it can not
increase! For the cost of two family nights at a fast food restaurant (four
burgers with the works), you will have access to the many services your
library can provide.

Your library is a bargain! You can build library services with your "YES"
vote. You and your family will have full library access. You will help expand
library services to your home and your schools.

Vote "YES" on Measure "D" for your library and our future. Urge two
friends to vote "YES" too.
