ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE H

Open Letter to Hawthorne Voters:

Dear Friends,

On November 7, 2000, you have an opportunity to enhance the Hawthorne city
budget by voting for Proposition H on your Hawthorne ballot.

This is a tax. BUT, THIS TAX WILL NOT COST YOU A PENNY! This is called
a “Transient Occupancy Tax,” (TOT). TOT is applied to hotel/motel bills when
visitors stay overnight in our city.

Hawthorne has several motels and a couple of hotels, and there are plans for a
hotel development on Rosecrans with over 200 rooms. We want to capture that
revenue, but we need your approval.

For too long, Hawthorne’s TOT was below market standards at a low 8%. We
must catch up. Most cities in South Bay and all across our State are charging at
least 12% TOT. We are asking you to support this tax at 12% in our city also.

Your vote in favor of Proposition H will help us better respond to the needs of
our community. This is the time when you can go to the polls and freely vote YES
on a tax that will not affect your pocket book, but it WILL help your city bring
in more revenue. When we bring in more revenue, we will be able to bring you
better services through improved park safety, pool maintenance, increased police
service, street/sidewalk repairs, and much more.

This is a sincere message to every Hawthorne citizen. My colleagues on the City
Council have all voted to support this issue. Please join us. We need your support
too. We trust you will help Hawthorne.

PLEASE VOTE YES ON PROPOSITION H.
