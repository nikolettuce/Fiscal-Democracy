Trinity County Hotel Tax Increase,
Measure W (November 2015)

| Text of measure

Ballot question

The following question appeared on the ballot:^

Shall the County of Trinity adopt an ordinance amending section 3.28 of the Trinity
County Code by imposing a special five percent (5%) tax charged to guests of
hotels and motels under the County’s Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance for the
purpose of providing more funding to local law enforcement, fire protection and
promotion of tourism, with the maximum amount collected not exceeding two
million dollars $2,000,000 per calendar year?3]

Arguments in favor

Official argument

The following official argument was submitted in favor of Measure W:

To support and grow our local tourism economy, and to partially address the
increased demand on public safety, the Trinity County Board of Supervisors
adopted a resolution for a special election to create an additional special transient
occupancy tax of 5%.

Measure W increases the existing Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) from 5% to
10%, collected by hotels from their guests. A portion of those funds have
historically been used for the purpose of promoting Trinity County to increase
overall tourism, an important economic sector for the county. Shasta and Humboldt
Counties currently collect 10% from hotelguests and have focused heavily on
tourism as part of their economic future.

While some of this new revenue will go towards tourism promotion, there will also
be funding dedicated to public safety to support the Sheriffs Department and
County Volunteer Fire Departments, both of which have increased demand and
need. The breakdown for each year is: 30% Tourism Marketing, 20% County
Volunteer Fire Departments and 50% to the Sheriffs Department. In 2019, the
percentages shift to 50% for Marketing, 30% for the Sheriff Department and 20%
continues for the fire departments. Because this special tax requires 2/3 approval,
not just 50% +1, this revenue can only be used for these three functions and stated
purposes, as specified, every year.

As tourism increases with the help of these additional marketing funds TOT dollars
should increase overall, providing a natural revenue increase to these specific
entities every year. A stronger tourism economy also enhances stability in other
local businesses which strengthens the overall economy. We believe that the voters
of Trinity County can make an informed decision about their support for expanding
our local tourism economy and these vital public safety services.

Please support Measure W and help your community.

Arguments against

Official argument

The following official argument was submitted in opposition to Measure W:

Measure W is chiefly a proposed response to problems associated with
the marijuana industry in our county. Unfortunately, it's insufficient for
the purpose, not the best tool for the job, and a poor substitute for
effective action by the County. Please consider:

1.	The proposition is potentially misleading by its reference to
raising not more than $2,000,000. Based on the five most
recent years, the new tax would in fact generate an annual
average of $213,000 (actually $170,000 useable, once tax
collection administrative costs are deducted), nothing close to
$2,000,000. The revenues would not be required to combat
problems caused by illegal marijuana, and are not nearly
enough to take meaningful steps toward the announced
purposes. This relatively small dribble of tax money is not a
solution for anything, it's more an attempt to divert public
attention from County inaction.

2.	The proposition does not guarantee that the tax revenue
would result in net increased county spending on the
announced purposes, only that these particular tax revenues
would be earmarked for those purposes. Meanwhile county
general funds in the affected budgets could be reduced or
diverted to other purposes.

3.	AB 266 which is now in the California's legislature would
authorize a county to impose a tax on the cultivation,
processing, and dispensing of medical marijuana. That tax
would be for specific purposes like marijuana related code
enforcement, and enforcement of existing criminal laws, which
still define cultivation and possession for sale of non-medical
marijuana as felonies.

Let's require the County to get its act together before
doubling the tax on innocent visitors, and let’s put our
efforts into backing proposals like AB 266 that are more
reliably focused on marijuana issues.'ra

Argument In Favor of Measure W

To support and grow our local tourism economy, and to partially address the increased demand on
public safety, the Trinity County Board of Supervisors adopted a resolution for a special election to
create an additional special transient occupancy tax of 5%.

Measure W increases the existing Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) from 5% to 10%, collected by hotels

Trinity County to increase overall tourism, an important economic sector for the county. Shasta and
Humboldt Counties currently collect 10% from hotel guests and have focused heavily on tourism as part
of their economic future.

While some of this new revenue will go towards tourism promotion, there will also be funding dedicated
to public safety to support the Sheriffs Department and County Volunteer Fire Departments, both of
which have increased demand and need. The breakdown for each year is: 30% Tourism Marketing, 20%
County Volunteer Fire Departments and 50% to the Sheriffs Department. In 2019, the percentages shift
to 50% for Marketing, 30% for the Sheriff Department and 20% continues for the fire departments.

Because this special tax requires 2/3 approval, not just 50% +1, this revenue can only be used for these

As tourism increases with the help of these additional marketing funds TOT dollars should increase
overall, providing a natural revenue increase to these specific entities every year. A stronger tourism
economy also enhances stability in other local businesses which strengthens the overall economy.

We believe that the voters of Trinity County can make an informed decision about their support for
expanding our local tourism economy and these vital public safety services.
