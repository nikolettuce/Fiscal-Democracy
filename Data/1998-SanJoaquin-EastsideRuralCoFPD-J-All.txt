Impartial Analysis of Measure J	Argument in favor of the Measure J
Prepared by County Counsel	
Eastside Rural County Fire Protection District provides fire protection serv- The District's revenue comes from ad valorem property taxes which are icted by Article Xlif A of the California Constitution. Article XIIIA permits the rsition of a special tax upon a two-thirds vote. The District proposes an annual rial tax as set forth in the District's Ordinance.  special tax would be calculated on classes of improvements to property or •; of property, or a combination thereof. The District’s Ordinance sets forth the ' imum rates allowable for the calculation of the special tax, which are calcu- 1 based upon classes of improvements to property or use, or a combination  30f.  District could charge less than the maximum approved special tax. The oved special tax would be collected in the same manner and subject to the e penalty as other charges and taxes collected by the County of San Joaquin ehalf of the District. The special tax shall be in addition to the annual tax rate ved by law.  proved, all proceeds of the special tax levied under this ordinance shall only expended for the purpose of obtaining, furnishing, and maintaining fire ection, suppression and emergency medical services.  o-thirds (2/3) of those voting on this measure vote ‘YES”, the District may • a special tax up to the amounts set forth in the Ordinance.  above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure J. If you desire a y of the Ordinance, please call the Eastside Fire District office at (209) ■3516 or the office of the Registrar of Voters at (209) 468-8945 and a copy be mailed at no cost to you.	Measure J-Special fire tax would provide the additional funds necessary to continue with Class 1 and 2 fire protection in the Eastside Rural County Fire Protection District.  The cost to a homeowner of a 1200 square foot home would be $36.00 for the first year and could increase to a maximum of $60.00 per year. The maximum cost to the average homeowner over ten years would be $576.00.  The alternative is less fire protection with apart paid/part volunteerfire department and one fire house, possibly a Class 8 to 10 fire district, or privatized services.  Homeowners fire insurance costs could increase an estimated 90% or more. The average home insured for $60,000 now costs about $229.00 per year. That insurance cost could increase to about $438.00 per year, or an increase of $209.00. Over ten years additional insurance costs could be $2,090.00 or more.  In the first year the cost of the fire tax on a 1200 square foot home would be $36.00.  The additional cost for fire insurance on a$60,000 home could be approximately $209.00.  It makes more sense to pay $36.00 for the fire, tax for the first year and have top-rate fire service than to pay $209.00 or more for additional fire insurance in the first year and have very limited fire service. •  /s/Kathleen A.
