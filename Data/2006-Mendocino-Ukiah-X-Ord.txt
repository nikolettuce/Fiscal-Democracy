SECTION 1752 TO INCREASE THE TRANSIENT
OCCUPANCY TAX FROM 8% TO 10%

The people of the City of Ukiah do ordain as follows:

Section 1752 of the Ukiah City Code is hereby amended to read as follows:

§1752:	TAX IMPOSED: Each transient paying for the privilege of occupancy in

any hotel shall pay a tax in the amount of ten percent (10%) of the rent
charged by the operator. Said tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the City
which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the City. The transient shall
pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in
installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The
unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for
any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the Tax Administrator may
require that such tax shall be paid directly to the Tax Administrator.

Enacted by a majority vote at the municipal election held on November 7, 2006.
