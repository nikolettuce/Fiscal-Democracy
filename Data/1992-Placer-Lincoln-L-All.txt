IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
MEASURE L

If this Measure is approved by a majority of the voters voting in this election, the City's
Business License Tax for most businesses will be increased.

In order to conduct business, each business in the City is required to pay a business
license tax in an amount set out in the City's Municipal Code. Approval of this Measure (Ordinance
575 B) will increase the Business License Tax for most businesses in varying amounts, depending
on the nature of the business.

The annual business license tax for businesses operating a motel, hotel or trailer park
will increase from five dollars ($5) per unit available for rent to ten dollars ($10) per unit.
The annual business license tax for those businesses which utilize vehicles and have no fixed
place of business such as ambulance services will increase from twenty five dollars ($25)
for the first vehicle to fifty dollars ($50) for the first vehicle and from fifteen dollars ($15)
for each additional vehicle to thirty dollars ($30) for each additional vehicle.

Currently, the maximum business license tax for other businesses which would be affected
by this Measure is thirty dollars ($30) a year. Approval of this Measure would result in a
maximum business license tax of one hundred dollars ($100) a year for those businesses.

The revenue collected from this tax will be deposited into the City's general fund and
may be spent for any municipal purpose.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure "L" (Ordinance 575 8). If you
desire a copy of the Measure (Ordinance), please call the City Clerk's office at (916- 645-3314)
and a copy will be mailed at no cost to you.

Dated: July 28, 1992

Lincoln City Attorney

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR
MEASURE L

Measure L would enact a modest increase in the business license tax for the City of Lincoln
effective January 1, 1993. It will not result in a lax increase for the residents of the
City of Lincoln. The purpose of the business license tax is to provide additional revenue
for community services such as libraries and parks and recreation.

The business license tax for the City of Lincoln has not been increased since 1974, and is
significantly lower than neighboring communities. Currently, the average business in the City
pays $30.00 per year for a business license. Measure L would increase that annual charge
for the average' business to $50.00 per year.' . /	‘ '

You are urged to vote "YES" on Measure L to allow for this appropriate increase in the City
business license tax .to provide additional revenue for community services.
