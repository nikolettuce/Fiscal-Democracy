IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY COUNTY COUNSEL
MEASURE 03-A SPECIAL TAX
Mammoth Unified School District

Measure 03-A would enact a special tax in the amount of fifty-nine
dollars ($59.00) per year on each parcel of land within the boundaries
of the Mammoth Unified School District that receives a separate tax
bill from the Mono County Assessor’s Office and is not otherwise
exempt from the property tax. The special tax will be levied for four
years. The proceeds of the special tax will be used for educational
purposes within the School District including acquisition of books
and supplies, maintenance of school libraries and materials, teacher
salaries and benefits, technical support services and computer labs,
and purposes for which other sources of funding, including state
funding, have been reduced or lost.

Measure 03-A will increase the School District’s appropriations limit
per fiscal year, for the next four years, in an amount equal to the
levy of the special tax.

This Measure will not change any existing ordinance or other law.
The special tax will be collected by the Mono County Tax Collector
at the same time as, and along with, the ad valorem property tax,
and shall be subject to the same penalties if the special tax is not
paid in a timely manner. An exemption will be available for any
person sixty-five (65) years or older who owns and occupies as a
principal residence a parcel subject to the special tax and who
applies to the School District for the exemption in a manner to be
established by the School District.

The Measure will require the School District’s governing board,
Superintendent and officers to provide accountability measures that
will include, but not be limited to: (a) a statement indicating the
specific purposes of the special tax; (b) a requirement that the
proceeds be applied only to the specific purposes identified; (c) the
creation of an account into which the proceeds from the special tax
shall be deposited; and (d) the preparation of an annual report by
the chief fiscal officer of the School District to be filed with the
School District’s governing board no later than January 1, 2004,
and at least once a year thereafter. This report must specify the
amount of the special tax collected and expended and the status
of any project authorized to be funded by the special tax.

Measure 03-A is a special tax earmarked for specific purposes.
Measure 03-A will pass and the special tax will be levied upon
approval of two-thirds of the votes cast.

A “YES” vote on Measure 03-A means you wish to approve and
enact the special tax.

A "NO" vote on Measure 03-A means you do not wish to approve
and enact the special tax.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure 03-A
and the special tax it would enact. If you desire a copy of the
measure, please call the elections official at (760) 932-5530 and
a copy will be mailed at no cost to you.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE 03-A
Mammoth Unified School District

Our schools have done a good job of providing a quality educational
program in our community, and student test scores have improved
steadily. However, the State's budget crisis has severely impacted
schools across California, and the Mammoth Unified School District
is no exception. The State is drastically cutting funds to support
local education. We have an opportunity to protect our students from
some of these cuts.

Measure 03-A will allow the District to ensure reliable funding for
local schools in order to maintain current classroom programs, provide
high quality teaching, academic materials, and smaller class sizes.
It will help minimize some of the effects of the State cuts from
impacting our students’ education. As taxpayers, we all agree in the
importance of an excellent education and the value of good schools.
This measure is necessary to preserve the quality of education in
our community.

MEASURE 03-A WILL MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF STATE CUTS
AND ALLOW US TO CONTINUE;

•	Providing students with books and supplies;

•	Maintaining school libraries and updated materials;

•	Retaining and attracting good teachers by preserving competitive
teacher salaries and benefits;

•	Preserving smaller class sizes; and

•	Maintaining technical support services and updating computer
labs

Measure 03-A is a local measure with local control. ALL revenue
raised from Measure 03-A will be invested in our schools and cannot
be taken by the State. It will also establish a citizens’ oversight
committee to protect taxpayer funds and to ensure that dollars raised
through this measure will be used for the specific purposes promised
to voters. The Measure would levy the tax for a limited period of
four years and would exempt senior citizen property owners age 65
and older.

INVEST IN OUR COMMUNITY AND PROTECT OUR LOCAL SCHOOLS.
VOTE YES ON MEASURE 03-A.
