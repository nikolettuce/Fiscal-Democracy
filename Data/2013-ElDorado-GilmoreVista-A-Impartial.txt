GILMORE VISTA ZONE OF BENEFIT SPECIAL TAX MEASURE

MEASURE A

This measure, if approved by 2/3 of the voters voting on the measure, would authorize a special
tax on parcels of real property in the Gilmore Vista Zone of Benefit within County Service Area
No. 9, to be used solely for the costs of providing road improvement and maintenance services
within the Gilmore Vista Zone of Benefit.

This special tax would be in the amount of $270 per year per parcel of improved land, and $120
per parcel of unimproved land, located within the boundaries of the Gilmore Vista Zone of
Benefit. The special tax authorized by this measure would commence in fiscal year 2013/2014
and would replace an existing benefit assessment of $170 currently imposed on improved parcels
and $70 currently imposed on unimproved parcels on most of the parcels within the Zone of
Benefit for the same purposes.

The special tax will be listed as a separate item on the county property tax bill for each affected
parcel of land, and will be collected in the same way as the general property tax. All laws
applicable to the levy, collection, and enforcement of county property taxes, including the
provisions for penalties and the procedures for sale of the property in case of delinquency, shall
also apply to the special tax.

State law requires the proceeds from the special tax be applied only to the identified purposes,
and that an annual report be made indicating the amount of funds collected and expended and the
status of any project required or authorized to be funded by the proceeds.

This measure requires an affirmative vote of 2/3 or more of all voters voting on the measure in
order to pass.

A “YES” vote is a vote to authorize the special tax provided in the measure.

A “NO” vote is a vote against the special tax provided in the measure.
