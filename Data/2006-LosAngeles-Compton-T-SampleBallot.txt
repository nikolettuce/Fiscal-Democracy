IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE T

UTILITY USERS TAX

Measure T, if approved by a majority vote, would authorize an amendment to
the City’s current utility users tax ordinance to reduce the tax rate percentage
and provide modern definitions for the taxation of telecommunication services in
the City.

The proposed amendments to the City’s utility users tax relative to
telecommunication services include:

-	Reduction of the current utility tax on telecommunication services by 1 lA%
(from 10% to 8.5%);

-	A modern definition of telecommunication services and ancillary services that
is technology-neutral, and includes the use of internet protocol (VoIP),
broadband service and private networks for providing such services;

-	The addition of interstate and international calls so that all taxpayers are
treated the same;

-	Annual verification that the telecommunications tax has been properly
collected and that all revenues have been properly expended through the use
of third party auditors;

-	Anticipation of the likelihood that other municipalities will modernize their
utility users tax ordinances, and allows for a state-wide mechanism that will
facilitate uniform interpretations and administration;

-	Other administrative tools for addressing telecommunication taxation issues
including administrative rulings and sourcing, bundling and nexus guidelines;
and

-	Elimination of ambiguous language in the current ordinance that is the
subject of litigation in other taxing jurisdictions.

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE T (Continued)

The utility users tax is a general tax. All revenue generated by the tax would go to
the City’s general fund to provide essential government services including, but
not limited to: police, fire, public works, parks and recreation, job retention and
expansion efforts, and other essential government services. Currently, the utility
users tax on telecommunication services represents approximately $4.5 million or
11% of the City’s general fund. Growth trends in telecommunication related
services indicate that there may be no negative long term revenue impact due to
the proposed telecommunications tax reduction from 10% to 8.5%. This
measure must be approved by a majority of the voters.
