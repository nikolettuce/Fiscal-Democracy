CITY OF HEALDSBURG
MEASURE P

Shall the City continue the existing hotel tax, paid by
guests and collected by hotel operators, at the rate of
10% of the room rate?

CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE P

The City Council of the City of Healdsburg has placed Measure P on the ballot for
the November 5,2002 election to ask voters to affirm the imposition of the City’s
existing general tax on the use of hotel accommodations in the City.

On April 19, 1965, pursuant to its authority under California Revenue and
Taxation Code sections 7280 et seq., the City Council adopted Ordinance No.
469, codified as Chapter 18, Article III of the Municipal Code, which provided for
the imposition and collection of a general excise tax on the privilege of using hotel
accommodations in the City (a "transient occupancy tax” or ‘TOT”) to be paid by
hotel users and collected by hotel operators.

The City Council subsequently adopted Ordinance No. 569 on September 17,
1973; Ordinance No. 598 on June 2,1975; Ordinance No. 737 on November 21,
1983; and Ordinance No. 885 on December 7,1992, all increasing the rate of the
TOT, which is currently ten percent (10%) of the room rate.

As a general tax, revenue from the TOT is not restricted to a specific use.

The effect of the approval of Proposition 218, a statewide initiative approved by
the voters in November 1996, which added Articles XIIIC and D to the California
Constitution, was to require cities that had previously adopted some kinds of
general taxes to submit those taxes to the cities’ voters to affirm their continued
imposition. On-going litigation over the scope of Proposition 218 and Proposition
62, however, continues to create uncertainty for many cities regarding which
general taxes instituted require voter approval.

The City Council placed Measure P before the voters to foreclose any future
challenges to the legitimacy of the TOT.

As required by state law, Resolution No. 86-2002 sets forth the type of tax,
amount of the tax, manner of collecting the tax, exemptions, refunds, use of the
proceeds and other related matters.

The continued collection of the tax would be affirmed only if Measure P is
approved by a majority of those voting on the issue.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE P

Every time a visitor stays in a Healdsburg hotel room, they pay a 10% room
surcharge, called the transient Occupancy tax (TOT), or bed tax. Healdsburg has
weathered the current recession better than most cities in Northern California, and
one of the main reasons is the revenue brought in by the TOT. This money helps
balance our annual budget, and pays for vital community services, like parks,
recreation, senior services, and the local bus system.

Unfortunately, recent state legislation undermines the security of this revenue, and
we need voter approval to make sure we can continue to collect it. Measure P Is not
a new tax, and it won’t cost you a dime. It merely ratifies what we already collect,
and guarantees that money will be available for local services.

Please join us in voting for this vital funding source. If you have any questions or
would like more information about this measure, please don’t hesitate to call any of
us.

FULL TEXT OF MEASURE P

RESOLUTION NO.________

A RESOLUTION OF THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY OF
HEALDSBURG AFFIRMING THE IMPOSITION OF A GENERAL
EXCISE TAX ON THE PRIVILEGE OF USING HOTEL ACCOM-
MODATIONS IN THE CITY, AT THE RATE OFTEN PERCENT OF
THE ROOM RATE, AND AUTHORIZING THE CITY COUNCIL TO
AMEND THE EXISTING ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES FOR
THE COLLECTION OF THE TAX WITHOUT THE DIRECT
APPROVAL OF THE VOTERS OF THE CITY

WHEREAS, on April 19, 1965, pursuant to its authority under California
Revenue and Taxation Code sections 7280 et seq., the City Council of the City of
Healdsburg adopted Ordinance No. 469, codified as Chapter 18, Article III of the
Municipal Code, which provided for the imposition and collection of a general
excise tax on the privilege of using hotel accommodations in the City (a “transient
occupancy tax” or “TOT”) to be paid by hotel users and collected by hotel
operators; and

WHEREAS, the City Council subsequently adopted Ordinance No. 569 on
September 17,1973, Ordinance No. 598 on June 2,1975, Ordinance No. 737 on
November 21,1983, and Ordinance No. 885 on December 7,1992, all increasing
the rate of the TOT, which is currently ten percent of the room rate; and

WHEREAS, on November 6, 1996, the voters of California approved
Proposition 218, which added Articles XIIIC and D to the state constitution; and

WHEREAS, Article XIIIC, section 2(c) of the California Constitution now
requires that any general tax, such as the TOT, be approved by a majority vote of
the voters voting on the imposition of the tax; and

WHEREAS, litigation and court decisions that followed the approval of
Propositions 62 and 218 left open questions about the need for cities that had
adopted taxes without a popular vote to obtain voter approval to continue to
impose the taxes; and

WHEREAS, the California Supreme Court answered many of those
questions in a decision published last year; and

WHEREAS, on June 18, 2002, in accordance with Government Code
section 65954.6, the City properly noticed a public meeting and hearing to
consider asking the voters to affirm the continued imposition of the existing TOT;
and

WHEREAS, on July 1,2002, the City Council held a public meeting and
heard public testimony regarding asking the voters to affirm the continued
imposition of the existing TOT; and

WHEREAS, on August 5,2002, the City Council held a public hearing to
consider the current legal obligations of cities that adopted general taxes prior to
the approval of Proposition 218; and

WHEREAS, after considering the City’s current obligations, the Council
decided to ask the voters to affirm the continued imposition of the TOT to forestall
any future questions about its validity; and

WHEREAS, based on the information received at the public meeting and
public hearing identified above, both written and oral, as reflected in the minutes
of those meetings, the Council found that, under California Environmental Quality
Act (“CEQA”) Guidelines 15060(c)(2) and 15378(b)(4), the TOT does not
constitute a project under CEQA and therefore review under that Act is not
required; and

WHEREAS, the City Council then adopted Resolution No. 86-2002, which
placed a question on the ballot for the November 5,2002 election seeking voter
affirmation of the City’s existing TOT, to bring the tax into compliance with current
law.

NOW, THEREFORE, THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY OF HEALDSBURG

existing general excise tax on the privilege of using hotel accommodations in the

the room rate, as set forth in Section 18-13 of the Municipal Code, which was last
amended by Ordinance, is also affirmed. The tax shall continue to be collected from
transients by the accommodation provider and transmitted to the City, as provided
for in Article III, as it may be amended in the future.

2.	Amendments by City Council Authorized. The City Council is hereby
authorized to amend Chapter 18, Article III of the Municipal Code to add or revise
the administrative procedures for the collection of the tax and other such matters,

method of its collection.

3.	Effective Date. This resolution shall take effect upon approval by the
majority of voters voting at the general election of November 5,2002.
