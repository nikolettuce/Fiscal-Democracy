IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE B

By Raymond G. Fortner, Jr., Acting County Counsel

Approval of Measure B would authorize the Altadena Library District to'levy a
special tax upon each parcel of land within the District.

The tax revenues would be used to fund library services and facilities.

The special tax would be levied in the amount of $40.63 per single family
residence parcel, $27.85 per apartment unit, $82.38 per commercial parcel of less
than 10,000 square feet, and $111.39 per commercial parcel of 10,000 square feet
or more.

The special tax shall be levied for a maximum ten (10) year period beginning July
1, 2005, and would continue the current special tax which is due to expire on
June 30, 2005. The special tax shall be increased or decreased each year after the
first year by the percentage change in the Los Angeles, Anaheim, Riverside All
Urban Consumer Price Index. The per parcel special tax shall become a lien
upon each parcel.

Owners of single family residence parcels with a yearly income of $18,000 or less
(as substantiated by the most recent Federal Income Tax Return form filed with
the United States Government) are exempt from the special tax, provided an
exemption form is filed with the Altadena Board of Trustees.

This Measure requires a two-thirds (2/3) vote for passage.

ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE B

THIS MEASURE IS NOT A NEW TAX: In 1994 and 1998 voters approved a
special assessment to save Altadena’s outstanding public library. This measure
simply CONTINUES the library assessment for another ten years with a modest
adjustment for inflation and for improved services.

Library Trustees report that the 1994 and 1998 measures have worked well and
that continuing them is absolutely essential to preserve and strengthen our
library. Indeed, your YES vote is the only way to prevent disastrous cuts in
service.

WITHOUT THIS MEASURE, OUR LIBRARY FACES DEVASTATING
DAMAGE: Over the years, the state has taken away 40% of our library district’s
property revenues. The library assessment replaces that revenue. With it,
Altadena can look forward to improving library services. Without it, we’ll face
the same disastrous cuts we faced in 1994 and 1998:

Main Library closed Sundays, Wednesdays, Fridays and most evenings.

Branch Library closed all but two afternoons a week.

Book budget virtually eliminated.

Vital services - including reference, children’s services, community computer
access, and literacy programs - slashed or eliminated.

Required major facilities maintenance could not be performed.

CLOSING LIBRARIES HURTS CHILDREN MOST: School libraries have
been cut to the bone. Without public libraries, many children will never be
exposed to books and learning. Others will have no safe, quiet place to study.

LESS THAN 15 CENTS A DAY is a small price to Preserve Altadena Libraries:
Most people chip in about fifteen cents a day; businesses and landlords pay a
little extra; and the very poor are exempt. After ten years, voters decide whether
to renew the assessment. What could be fairer?

Altadena has built and cherished a library district of rare quality. We must not let
it be destroyed. Please Preserve Altadena Libraries. VOTE YES on Proposition
B.
