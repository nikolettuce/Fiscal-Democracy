A RESOLUTION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF BEAR
VALLEY COMMUNITY HEALTHCARE DISTRICT CALLING AN
ELECTION ON JUNE 3, 2014 TO AUTHORIZE A SPECIAL TAX
UPON ALL TAXABLE PARCELS OF REAL PROPERTY WITHIN
THE DISTRICT; ESTABLISHING A DEADLINE DATE FOR
RECEIPT OF WRITTEN ARGUMENTS FOR AND AGAINST THE
MEASURE, AND REQUESTING CONSOLIDATION WITH THE
STATEWIDE ELECTION

WHEREAS, Bear Valley Community Healthcare District (the “District”) was formed in 1974
pursuant to Health & Safety Code Section 32000 et seq., for the purpose of operating a
hospital (the “Hospital”) and providing services to help promote the health of the residents of
the District and

WHEREAS, the District has provided continuous emergency, medical, acute care and related
health care services to local residents for nearly 40 years; and

WHEREAS, vital services must be continued in order for the District to meet the health care
needs of the community; and

WHEREAS, the District's income from all sources, including current taxes and. managed care
contractual fees generated from patient care services, is grossly inadequate for operating the
Hospital and related services; and

WHEREAS, many residents of the District have expressed a strong desire to keep the
Hospital open and operating; and

WHEREAS, sufficient revenue cannot be raised through fees generated from patient care
services because of low Hospital census, the need to provide services to indigent patients,
cutbacks from third party payors (including Medicare, Medi-Cal, insurance plans, health
maintenance organizations, and similar payors), and other reasons; and

WHEREAS, pursuant to Government Code Sections 53720-53730.02, a special tax may be
assessed in Bear Valley Community Healthcare District by an affirmative vote of two-thirds
of the voters within the District voting upon a measure to authorize this special tax; and

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors has authority to place propositions on the ballot to be
considered at a regular or special election of the District; and

WHEREAS, on November 4, 2003, two-thirds of the qualified voters of the District voting in
the election approved Measure Q; and

WHEREAS, the annual special tax expires on June 30,2015; and

WHEREAS, this Board of Directors finds that the special tax would benefit all parcels within
file District because keeping the Hospital open and continuing to provide other health care
services (1) increases the value of all of the property located within the District, including
unimproved, residential, commercial and industrial parcels; (2) helps promote the highest and
best use of the land in the District, including recreational uses or development; (3) are
essential to help promote the health of the residents of the District, particularly because the
nearest other general acute care hospital is located at such a long distance from the homes of
the District's residents; (4) promotes the local economy by employing a number of residents
of the District; (5) improves access to better insurance coverage and lower premium rates;

(6) improves the quality of life for residents of the District by providing health care services
and programs for everyone from infants to senior citizens; (7) provides expeditious treatment
for employees who become ill or are injured on the job, which is important because the
nearest other acute care hospital is located at such a long distance from the businesses located
in the District; (8) helps attract and retain new businesses; and (9) benefits commercial and
industrial properties and their businesses by making the area more attractive to vacationers
and residents, who may patronize or be employees of the businesses; and

WHEREAS, pursuant to Election Code Section 10400, it must be consolidated; and

WHEREAS, on February 26, 2014, the Board of Directors held a public hearing after due
notice to consider calling a special election for the purpose of submitting to the qualified
electors of the District a ballot measure proposing the extension of the annual special parcel
tax for a ten-year period commencing July 1, 2015, to provide for the continued operation and
maintenance by the District of a Hospital and its associated services on a twenty-four hour
basis; and

WHEREAS, it is the desire of this Board of Directors to conduct an election on June 3, 2014
for the purpose. of obtaining authorization for the imposition of a special tax within the
District for a period of ten (10) years, to request consolidation with the consolidated election,

3.	The records of the San Bernardino County Assessor as of March 1 of each year preceding

exempt from taxation, except that the Board of Directors may exempt any specific parcel
upon request by the taxpayer in such form and procedure as may be determined by the
District. "Parcel of real property" as used in this Resolution and Healthcare Measure shall
be defined as any unit of real property in the District that receives a separate tax bill from
the San Bernardino County Treasurer/Tax Collector, without regard to whether the real
property constitutes a legally subdivided parcel in accordance with California law. An
“improved parcel” for purposes of this Resolution and the Healthcare Measure, shall mean
any parcel for which the San Bernardino County Assessor does assess tax for
improvements on such parcel, whereas an “unimproved parcel” shall mean any parcel for
which the San Bernardino County Assessor does not assess tax for improvements.

and improved parcels of real property, and the special tax shall not be measured by the
value of the property.

5.	The Board of Directors shall be empowered to amend this Resolution by three (3)
affirmative votes of the members thereof in order to carry out the general purposes of this
measure, in order to conform to state law that permits the County Tax Collector, or other
proper official, to collect a tax such as is levied by Healthcare Measure in conjunction
with County taxes, or in order to assign duties pursuant to the measure to other officers;
provided, however, that no amendment shall permit the levy of a tax in excess of the
amount set forth in paragraph 1.

6.	Beginning with the fiscal year 2015-2016, the special tax imposed hereby shall be
collected in the same manner, on the same dates, and subject to the same penalties and
interests in accordance with established dates as, or with, other charges and taxes fixed
and collected by the County of San Bernardino on behalf of the Bear Valley Community
Healthcare District, and the County may deduct its reasonable costs incurred for such
services before remittal of the balance to the District.

7.	The special tax, together with all penalties and interest thereon, shall constitute a lien upon
the parcel upon which it is levied until it has been paid, and the special tax, together with
all penalties and interest thereon, shall, until paid, constitute a personal obligation to the
District by the persons who own the parcel on the date the tax is due.

8.	The special tax imposed by the Healthcare Measure shall not be imposed upon any other
local agency, federal or state governmental agency.

9.	The Healthcare Measure shall go into effect only if approved by two-thirds of the
qualified voters voting in an election to be held on June 3, 2014 and shall become
effective ten (10) days after the Board has by resolution declared that such measure was
approved by two-thirds of the voters voting thereon.

10.	The deadline date of March 20, 2014 at 5:00 PM is hereby established for receipt of
written arguments for or against the measure. The deadline date of March 25, 2014 at
5:00 PM is hereby established for the receipt of rebuttal arguments. Written arguments
and rebuttals may be submitted by members of this Board of Directors, any voter or bona
fide association of voters within the District, or any combination thereof. Arguments must
be accompanied by form statement 9600. Written arguments shall not exceed 300 words
in length, and rebuttals shall be filed with the Secretary of this Board of Directors at PO
Box 1649, Big Bear Lake, California 92315.

11.	The San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors is hereby requested to order that the
election on these measures be consolidated with the statewide election to be conducted on
June 3, 2014 and that the County Registrar of Voters conduct the election for the District.
The District shall reimburse the County of San Bernardino for services rendered in
connection with the election upon presentation to tire District of a properly approved bill.
The District shall further assist the County of San Bernardino as needed to prepare for and
conduct the consolidated election with tire District.

12.	Pursuant to Elections Code Section 10418, the consolidated election will be held and
conducted, election officers appointed, voting precincts designed, ballots printed, polls
opened and closed, ballots counted and returned, returns canvassed, results declared,
certificates of election issued and all other proceedings incidental to and connected with
the election shall be regulated and done in accordance with the provisions of law
regulating the statewide election with which the District election is consolidated.

13.	If the ballot measure adopting the ordinance extending the District’s special parcel tax for
hospital and healthcare services is approved by the qualified voters of the District, the
special parcel tax shall not apply to any person, entity, or property as to whom or which it
is beyond the power of the District to impose the tax herein provided. If for any reason
any provision of this Resolution, the Ballot Ordinance, or the application thereof is found
to be invalid, or if the special parcel tax is found inapplicable to any particular parcel
within the District by a Court of competent jurisdiction, the balance of this Resolution, the
Ballot Ordinance, and the application of the special parcel tax to the remaining parcels
within the District shall not be affected and, to the end, the provisions of this Resolution
and the Ballot Ordinance are severable.

14.	The Secretary of this Board of Directors is hereby instructed to file certified copies of this
Resolution with the Clerk of the Board of Supervisors of San Bernardino County and with
the San Bernardino County Registrar of Voters on or before 5:00 PM on Friday, March 7,

15.	Pursuant to Government Code Section 50075.1(c), the District shall create a designated
account into which the proceeds of the tax shall be deposited.

16.	The Board of Directors shall, pursuant to Government Code Section 50075.2, file an
annual report as provided therein, accounting for the tax collected and the manner in
which it has been spent.

The Secretary and the District's legal counsel are authorized and instructed to take such

further action as may be necessary in preparing for and conducting the consolidated election.
