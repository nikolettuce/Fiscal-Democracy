<fiscal> TAX-RATE STATEMENT MEASURE F

STATEMENT IN COMPLIANCE WITH
ELECTIONS CODE SECTIONS 5300 AND 5301

As indicated in the accompanying materials, an election is being held in
Zone Three (the โZoneโ) of the Riverside County Flood Control and Water
Conservation District (the โDistrictโ) on November 4,1986 for the purpose of
submitting to the registered voters of the Zone, as Measure F, the proposition
of whether a bonded indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount not to
exceed $8,000,000 shall be incurred by and for the Zone for a maximum term
of not more than 40 years and with interest at a rate or rates not to exceed 12%
per annum, or such other rate as may be the maximum interest rate permitted
by law, for the purpose of financing the design, acquisition and construction
of drainage and flood control improvements within and for the Zone, and
whether benefit assessments shall be annually levied on property within the
Zone in amounts which in the aggregate will be sufficient to pay the principal
of and interest on the bonds thereof and the administrative expenses of the
District in levying and collecting such assessments.

If the bonds are authorized and sold, the principal thereof and interest
thereon will be payable from the proceeds of benefit assessments to be levied
on taxable property in the Zone. The following information regarding the
benefit assessments is given to comply with Section 5301 of the Elections
Code. Such information is based upon the best estimates and projections
presently available from official sources and other experience within the
Zone, or other demonstrable factors, but is subject to change.

The benefit assessments, as adopted by the Board of Supervisors of the
District, by Resolution No. F86-21, on August 5, 1986, are set forth in the
report referred to in said resolution and which was the subject of a public
hearing which was conducted by said Board of Supervisors on said
date. Copies of said resolution and said report are on file in the office of the
Clerk of the Board of Supervisors of the District.

Following the sale of the bonds for the Zone, the Board of Supervisors of
the District will annually levy benefit assessments on all taxable property in
the Zone sufficient to pay the interest on the bonds for the year and the portion
of the principal thereof which will be due during the years.

The benefit assessments to be levied on taxable property in the Zone will
not be based on assessed valuation, but will be based on benefit derived by lots
and parcels of land within the Zone from the proposed improvements,
expressed as benefit assessment units, as determined and set forth in the report
hereinbefore mentioned.

The estimated amounts of benefit assessments which will be required to
be levied to fund the bond issue during the first fiscal year after the first sale of
the bonds when such benefit assessments will be levied for various classifications of property (e.g., residential, commercial, etc.), based on an assessment
of S30.00 per benefit assessment unit, are as follows:


The best estimates of the amounts of benefit assessments which will be
required to be levied to fund the bond issue during the fiscal year after the last
sale of the bonds and of the highest amounts of benefit assessments which will
be required to be levied on property within the Zone for payment of annual
principal of and interest on the bonds, is that said benefit assessments will be
in approximately the same amounts as are set forth in the above table. <fiscalend>












<favor> ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE โFโ
WE URGE A YES VOTE FOR FLOOD CONTROL


We, who have resided in the Lake Elsinore Valley since 1980 or 1983, or who
have been closely associated with it, have seen first hand the damage that can
occur as the result of the flooding of Lake Elsinore as well as the damages
wrought by many of its surrounding tributaries. The Riverside County
Flood Control and Water Conservation District, working in cooperation with
the County and City and other local jurisdictions, is responsible for
constructing the flood control projects needed to minimize future damages.
However, projected revenues for the District fall far short of meeting the
needs.

The issue placed before you, if approved, will allow the District to sell up to $8
million in bonds. The proceeds, when coupled with other District revenue
and Federal, State and City monies, will allow the District, over the next 8 to
10 years, to construct major flood control facilities. The facilities will be
located in the Four Corners, West Elsinore, Lakeland Village and Sedco Hills
areas and will also include improvement of the Lake Elsinore Outlet Channel
and its associated tributaries.

A yes vote, in addition to authorizing the sale of bonds will also set into
motion a benefit assessment program. This program provides an equitable
method of paying off the bonds by distributing the cost in relationship to the
stormwater runoff from each parcel of land. The average homeowner,
within the Lake Elsinore Valley, will pay an annual flood control benefit
assessment of approximately $30 per year to pay off the bonds. The cost per
household is small; community benefit is great.

Failure to provide this funding will result in an ever increasing gap between
needs and completed project construction, thereby resulting in a greater
potential for flood damage and possible loss of life.

You have the opportunity to support a solution to our Valleyโs flood control
problems with a yes vote. <favorend>
