This is a major barrier to our children\\'s success in school and in life. Our children deserve better! Two measures on this ballot will create and fund the Solano Fund for Children and invest in preventative programs that will fill some of the gaps confronting local children and their families. Measure A will impose a % cent sales tax throughout the county, raising an estimated 16.8 million dollars per year for ten years. Measure B assures that all Measure A revenues will go entirely to the Solano Fund for Children to serve only Solano children and their families. Money from the Fund will be spent on: • Homeless Children • Prevention of Child Abuse • Quality Preschool and Afterschool Programs • Preventative Child Health Care • Jobs for Youth Solano does not get its fair share of state and federal funding for children’s services, and gets almost no private foundation funds at all to support children. If we want to compete with the rest of the region, we have to support our own children by creating the Solano Fund for Children. It is what responsible citizens and caring adults must do. We will make sure that the funds are spent responsibly, efficiently and as promised. This measure includes strict accountability provisions including a citizen’s oversight committee, annual audits and public reporting of all expenditures. We can make sure that every child in our community has the opportunity to succeed, and remember, both measures must pass to assure the creation and funding of the Solano Fund for Children.

Measure F makes financial sense and protects taxpayers. This measure will only cost each parcel $65 annually (less than $5.42 per month). By law, all funds must be spent locally and cannot be taken by the State. Measure F provides an exemption for any parcel owned and occupied by a person 65 years of age or older.

Los Angeles County uses this funding to provide essential services like Sheriff deputies, health care, park and library operations, street repairs and other general fund services. Technology has changed since 1991, and the tax ordinance language is outdated. To keep pace with the advances in technology, this measure will modernize the Utility User Tax language. Updating the ordinance language allows the tax to be reduced from 5 percent to 4.5% (a ten percent reduction) because all taxpayers will be treated equally regardless of the technology they use, today and in the future. NO INTERNET SERVICES WILL BE TAXED, including such items as browsers, search engines and email or digital downloads such as books, music, ringtones, games, and similar digital products under the updated ordinance. The exemption from the Utility User Tax for low income senior citizens of the unincorporated area will continue, and the County will verify, on an annual basis through a qualified independent third party, that the Utility User Taxes have been properly applied, exempted, collected and expended.

Our streets have become our jails! This crisis threatens the safety of every man, woman and child and we need action. \"I\\'ve seen what they turn loose from the jails,” says Norma Phillips, President of Mothers Against Drunk Driving. “It\\'s scary!” Proposition A is the help we need. It would add a half cent to our sales tax for only five years and raise $400 million to build additional jails and courts. The revenue raised could only be used to provide facilities. This tax could not be extended beyond five years without another 2/3 vote of the electorate. Furthermore, if more state or federal funds for jails and courts become available, the tax will end sooner. Why use a sales tax? Because it’s fair to Mi and it’s smart for taxpayers. The jails and courts would be paid for without burdening our children and grandchildren with debt. Proposition A is a grass roots campaign supported by a broad coalition including: organizations such as MADD, Greater San Diego Chamber of Commerce, Neighborhood Watch groups, the media, police chiefs in every city in our county, school leaders, the clergy, and community leaders county wide.

This revenue has been crucial in preserving and enhancing the quality of life in our city. Measure G will keep San Luis Obispo moving in the right direction, and we urge you to vote Yes. Measure G does not increase taxes. It simply renews a tax that voters overwhelmingly approved in 2006. In all, the half percent tax has generated about $6.5 million a year, equal to 12% of the city's operating budget. Importantly, about 72% of the tax has been paid by visitors, not by residents. We believe city officials have been responsive to residents’ needs and priorities, and have invested wisely. The revenue has enabled the city to fix potholes and resurface streets; to acquire open space and improve public parks; to increase and improve bike lanes, and to add police officers to enhance safety downtown and reduce noise in neighborhoods. Annual audits have verified these facts. And for greater accountability, City Council said the tax should be put to voters for re approval after eight years. That time has come. Renewal will reinforce the city’s financial stability, and, importantly, these tax dollars will remain under local control. Additionally, a special citizens’ oversight commission will be created to monitor future spending and ensure that the revenue will continue to support essential services, such as police and fire protection, senior programs, park maintenance, street repair and open space acquisition. As parents and grandparents, as environmentalists and business owners, as concerned citizens and as your neighbors, we enthusiastically support renewal of this half percent sales tax for another eight years.

Last year, Albany voters approved a $31.6 million bond for the rehabilitation of existing buildings and the construction of much needed classrooms. The classrooms needed, six elementary and eight middle school, were to be built on our present campuses. This plan was the best solution available at the time, but it meant an excessive burden on bathrooms, cafeterias, and libraries and drastically reduced play space. Recently, a superior alternative has emerged. The Hill Lumber property, the only available site in Albany where a new school could be built, is now for sale. A citizens’ committee has developed a plan to buy the property, build a middle school there and convert our present middle school to an elementary campus. If Albany voters pass Measure A, we will have three efficient and well equipped elementary schools located throughout our city. Improvements including rehabilitation, safety, and seismic repairs will still be made to Cornell, Marin and Albany High School. There will be no increase in cost over the amount voters approved in 1993. But that bond measure did not specifically authorize the use of funds to buy property, so it is necessary for voters to approve this modification. Measure A has the support of all members of the Albany City Council and the Albany Board of Education. Measure A is a win win proposition. Our children win with better, safer schools and we taxpayers win too. High quality schools sustain a vital community and contribute to increased property values. Your vote for Measure A will give us better value for money we have already agreed to spend. We strongly urge a YES vote on Measure A. s/Helen Laird,')]"
